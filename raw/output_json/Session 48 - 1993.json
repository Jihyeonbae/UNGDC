        "file_text": "Let me begin by\nextending, on behalf of the people and Government of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, our most heartfelt\ncondolences to the peoples and Governments of both\nVenezuela and India, which have recently been hit severely\nby the tragedy of disaster. It is our hope that both countries,\nthrough the will and spirit of their peoples, will recover\nquickly.\nMay we also extend our sympathies to those countries\nand families that have lost loved ones under the United\nNations flag in Bosnia and Herzegovina in attempting to\ncarry out their mission of peace and humanity. Indeed, our\nsympathies go out to all families of United Nations\npersonnel in all peace-keeping missions throughout the globe\nwho have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nWe should also like to congratulate the Palestinian and\nIsraeli people on their recent efforts towards peace. We are\nlikewise happy to see the great strides towards democracy\nbeing made in South Africa.\nMr. President, it is my pleasure and privilege to extend\nto you our sincerest congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. Your election to this high office reaffirms the\nimportance of the role that small States play in the family of\nnations.\nWe should also like to extend our appreciation to your\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stojan Ganev,\nour Balkan colleague, for conducting the deliberations of this\nbody with great expertise and commitment.\nThe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pleased to\nwelcome the Organization\u2019s newest Members: Andorra, the\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Republic of\nMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. We are confident that\nthese Members will uphold the principles of the United\nNations Charter.\nThe international community has neither a definite\npolicy nor a clear plan of political action that would\nfacilitate a transition from the Communist structures that\nhave been in power for 50 years to concepts based on\nfreedom and democracy. We believe that it is impossible to\nfind solutions for either global or local conflicts unless a\nclear stand is taken on the overall question of what the\npost-Communist heritage is to be.\nThe negative aspects of this problem have been fully\nillustrated in the case of my country. It is obvious that the\nremaining forces of the Communist potential for aggression\nhave been exercised against us and that an extirpation of\nchances for democratic development has been perpetrated\nbefore the eyes of Europe, America and the whole world.\nThis act is being carried out entirely by force, in forms\nranging from aggression and mass murder of civilians to\ndestruction of all traces of civilization and culture and the\nextermination of whole nations by the barbaric tactics of\nburned and destroyed land.\nSimultaneously with this unprecedented violence, an\nexperiment in political vivisection is being carried out\nagainst our country. It is being carried out by an\ninternational community that, in the case of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, has obviously been testing various models for\nthe post-Communist State. The experiment, unfortunately,\nis being performed in vivo by testing various hypotheses on\nour living national and governmental organism. In this\nexperiment, our people are dying, and so is our country and\nour State.\nThe first experiment was performed by the London\nConference. This concept, which sought to stop the\naggression, was abandoned without a single attempt to\nimplement it; and this only intensified the war on our soil.\nThis was followed by an attempt to find a solution by means\nof constitutional, legal and political reform to a crisis that\nwas becoming ever deeper. This project, known as the\nVance-Owen plan, no one even attempted to implement. It\nwas abandoned only to be replaced by a new one, which is\nbased on the false thesis that what we have in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is a civil war between the three peoples and\nthat territorial partition is therefore the only solution.\nBut this plan is being fulfilled neither with respect to\nthe idea that the partition of the land should be carried out\nin accordance with the criterion of ethnic majority, nor with\nrespect to the basic intention of bringing about peace. As a\nresult, the uncontrollable unfolding of events will continue,\nand will cause nothing but new suffering for our people.\nNow the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are being\nasked to choose between a just, defensive war and an unjust\npeace. The war, if continued, is likely to cause further\nsuffering for our people and the further destruction of our\nnation. It could mean the death of thousands more.\nThe unjust peace plan is flawed because it is based\nupon the repugnant and historically failed concept of ethnic\npartition and apartheid. The flaw is compounded by the fact\nthat even the partition is unfair, since it seeks to satisfy the\naggressor\u2019s appetite for an inequitably large share at the\nexpense of the victim.\nHowever, the flaws in the so-called peace plan being\nforced upon us are not merely philosophical. First, any plan\nthat legitimizes genocide and promotes ethnic partition will\nmost likely sow the seeds for new aggression and fuel the\nfires of retribution. Secondly, any peace that does not\naddress the true causes of war will, at best, offer only\ntemporary, remedial relief rather than promoting the healing\nthat is essential. Finally, any peace plan that makes no\nprovision for a viable Bosnian State, that does not address\neven the most basic needs of the victim and that does not\nprovide the necessary measures for real implementation and\ndurability is, in the end, not a plan for real peace.\nLast week\u2019s provisional acceptance by the Bosnian\nParliament of the peace proposals is dependent on the same\nminimal adjustments that we have consistently held to be\nnecessary for a durable peace. These adjustments are the\nfollowing:\nFirst, the Bosnian Republic within the proposed Union\nof the Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be viable\ngeographically, economically, politically and defensively.\nSecondly, the aggressor forces must surrender control\nof the territories where they have slaughtered and expelled\ncivilian populations so that the Bosnians can return to their\nhomes. Well over half a million refugees would find it\nimpossible to return to villages, towns and cities from which\nthey were expelled if Serbian forces that committed murder,\nrape and torture were to continue to control those territories.\nThere is the option that some of those territories could be\ntemporarily administered by international peace-keeping\nforces.\nThirdly, the final agreement must contain\ncomprehensive and specific guarantees concerning its\nimplementation from those nations and regional\norganizations that will actually be enforcing the peace. Such\nguarantees must be an integral part of the peace accords and\ncannot be delayed until a later date. Otherwise, we risk\nadopting another agreement or commitment that will, like so\nmany others previously, become worthless for peace and of\nvalue only to further legitimize the aggressor.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3\nFourthly, in the event that the international community\nis not successful in implementing the peace plan, then we\nmust be allowed to arm and defend ourselves.\nConsistent with its authority and unavoidable\nresponsibility, the Security Council should evaluate the plan\nprepared by Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg to determine its\nconsistency or inconsistency with the United Nations Charter\nand numerous resolutions previously adopted by the Council.\nThe Council cannot escape its responsibilities and the\ninherent inconsistencies by hiding behind the frequently\nrepeated excuse that it will accept whatever all the parties\nagree to, when one party, the victim, is under the pressure\nof the very real threat of genocide.\nAs further negotiations on these matters continue, the\nmediation team should be enlarged to include a\nrepresentative of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO), which will most likely be the agent of\nenforcement. This would add a degree of clarity, direction\nand credibility to the talks that has been lacking so far.\nNow, let me bring to the Assembly\u2019s attention the\nimpending humanitarian tragedy unfolding in my country.\nOn behalf of all Bosnians, I must first thank the United\nNations and all the friendly Governments, private institutions\nand heroic individuals that have helped provide humanitarian\nassistance in Bosnia. We profoundly appreciate the efforts\nthat have so far saved many lives. But with the coming of\nwinter, more help will be needed if our wounded and\nmalnourished population is to avoid finally succumbing to\nstarvation, disease and exposure. In this effort it is essential\nthat the international community and its most capable\nmembers and relevant regional organizations do the\nfollowing: first, take steps to encourage and enforce the\nmaintenance of the cease-fires recently agreed to by all the\nrelevant forces; secondly, take steps, as envisioned in several\nSecurity Council resolutions, to stop the blockage of\nhumanitarian relief and other essential supplies such as\nwater, electricity and gas; thirdly, reopen Tuzla Airport,\nmaking possible the delivery of humanitarian relief to over\na million people; and, fourthly, establish clear demands for\nthe lifting of the siege of Sarajevo as a first step towards the\nlifting of all sieges of Bosnian towns, including the safe\nareas designated by Security Council resolutions 824 (1993)\nand 836 (1993).\nOur Bosnian minority in Serbia, the Muslims of\nSandzak, have been deprived of their rights. Many people\nwho have defended the rights of their countrymen have been\nimprisoned or expelled. While the Serbian regime has\nostensibly been protecting the rights of ethnic Serbs in\nCroatia, it has not been willing to recognize those same\nrights for minorities in Serbia. We demand the same rights\nfor the Muslims of Sandzak as those that Serbs are\ndemanding for themselves in Croatia. Future negotiations\ncannot neglect this very important political and human-rights\nissue.\nAs United States President Clinton recently stated\nbefore this body, the United Nations cannot become involved\nin every world conflict. United Nations involvement should\nonly be undertaken with a clear political and military\nstrategy in place. Tragically, United Nations involvement in\nBosnia and Herzegovina has so far shown the very antithesis\nof any clarity of objective and firmness of resolve. The\nmoral void created by this confusion has naturally been\nfilled with a determination to defer to the aggressor\u2019s wishes\nat the expense of the victim. The United Nations\nintervention, in its half-heartedness and equivocation,\ncombined with its proud insistence that it is getting the job\ndone and that therefore we cannot be allowed to arm\nourselves, may well go down in history as the principal\ninstrument of my country\u2019s destruction.\nIn this regard, a few unavoidable questions arise. Why\nhas there been no implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) calling for the lifting\nof the siege of our cities? What has happened to the\nSecurity Council\u2019s demands in resolution 752 (1992) for the\nwithdrawal of all Serbian military and paramilitary units\nfrom our country along with their heavy weapons? Why has\nthere been no implementation of Security Council resolutions\n787 (1992) and 838 (1993), which were to monitor the\nborder between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nprevent the continuing massive flow of arms and material\ngoing to the aggressors in Bosnia?\nIt is no longer possible to speak of non-intervention.\nThe international community\u2019s involvement in Bosnia began\nwith the imposition of the arms embargo and has continued\nthrough this whole series of unfulfilled commitments. The\nUnited Nations must either follow\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthrough with its intervention or decide to rescind that\nintervention. One way or another, it cannot continue with\nthe present policy, which makes it an accomplice in the\ndestruction of the Bosnian people.\nMy Government remains committed to peace and to the\nideals of a pluralistic, democratic and multi-religious society.\nUnfortunately, some of the very nations that espouse these\nideals world wide have betrayed them by inaction, and in\ntheir own backyards. We cannot indefinitely continue a\nstruggle on principle without adequate help from outside or\nwithout at least being afforded the full opportunity to defend\nourselves.\nThe action of our Parliament is clear in its commitment\nto peace, its demands for a viable State and a durable peace.\nPrinciples have been shamelessly abandoned by those who\nhad the greatest duty and reason to uphold them in our\ncountry. We cannot and will not accommodate the anxieties\nof those same Governments and allow them to pressure us\nto abandon our last hope for self-preservation and a real and\ndurable peace.\nAlthough there has been a process through which many\nwitnesses to this crime have become anaesthetized to its\nhorror, the horror itself will never go away, and future\ngenerations of the righteous and the just in every nation will\nneither forgive nor trust the countries which allowed it to\nhappen. At least a billion people are waiting for this body\nto act. Are Members really ready to surrender Bosnia and\nits people to annihilation? Those billion people I have\nmentioned, and not only they, will never forgive you.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of Kuwait, it gives me pleasure to\nconvey to Ambassador Insanally our sincere congratulations\non his unanimous election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I take this opportunity\nto assure him of the support and cooperation of the\ndelegation of Kuwait in recognition of the close ties that\nexist between our two countries. His ability and skill give\nus confidence that our deliberation under his leadership will\nbe fruitful.\nI am pleased also to pay a tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Minister for Foreign\nAffairs of Bulgaria, for his able and effective stewardship of\nthe General Assembly at its previous session.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Kuwait,\nI wish to extend deepest sympathy and condolences to the\nGovernment and the people of India with respect to the\ntragedy resulting from the earthquake in that country, which\nclaimed thousands of innocent victims.\nKuwait has been following the impressive role of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, in developing new\nmodalities of work for the United Nations that are more in\nline with the sweeping developments, events and changes\nthat are taking place in the world. We cannot but put on\nrecord our appreciation of the Secretary-General\u2019s tireless\nefforts and creativity in restructuring and streamlining the\nworld Organization to reflect in a more meaningful manner\nthe realities of the new world situation. He deserves special\ncredit for his promotion of the concept of preventive\ndiplomacy.\nKuwait takes pride in its backing of the United Nations\nand we do support the new approach it pursues despite the\nvarious difficulties it faces and the accusations levelled at it.\nThe United Nations, at the threshold of its fiftieth\nanniversary, needs from us every material and moral support\neach and every Member can extend to it. On the other hand,\nthe Organization itself should enhance its effectiveness,\nstreamline its structure and revitalize its organs, especially\nthe Security Council. The Council should reflect more\nclosely the new realities of today\u2019s world. It should be more\ncapable of making and preserving peace and more forcefully\nfirm in implementing its resolutions in consonance with the\nprovisions of the Charter.\nThe United Nations today reflects new world realities,\nas shown by the recent increase in its membership. Kuwait\nwelcomes the accession to United Nations membership by\nEritrea, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Monaco,\nAndorra and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\nand trusts that their accession to the Organization\u2019s\nmembership will consolidate further the efficacy and\nuniversality of multilateralism.\nWith the end of the cold war and the effectual\nparticipation by the United Nations in resolving many\ninternational problems, the world today is moving steadily\ntowards the realization of the principle of interdependence\nand mutual cooperation between members of the\ninternational community. The demise of bipolarity and the\ndisappearance of the barriers that used to separate peoples,\ntogether with closer contacts through mass communication\nmade available by the technological revolution, have made\nit possible for every individual to watch world events as they\nunfold. Thus peoples are now able to react to and interact\nwith global issues in an unprecedented manner. A direct\noutcome of all that is the constant expansion of the web of\ninterrelated interests, so that regional security has become an\ninseparable part of global security. Economic and social\ndevelopment issues have now acquired a high priority among\nthe concerns of the international community.\nWhile we in Kuwait support this new tendency, we\nmust stress that movement in the new direction should be\nhumane in concept, civilized in ways and means, pragmatic\nin modalities and realistic in aims. We also stress that the\nright of both the individual and the community to\ndevelopment should be accorded top priority among\ninternational concerns. In this context, we consider that the\nfirst and foremost human right is the right to secure essential\nnecessities of living. Social and economic development at\nvarious levels is a close second. Kuwait believes that\ndevelopment should be addressed collectively and that is the\nmost effective way of ensuring the availability of its\nessential ingredients, so that no region or group of nations\nshould monopolize world resources at the expense of whole\ncontinents which remain hostage to the cycle of want and\npoverty.\nWe view with satisfaction the new approach of dealing\ncollectively with hotbeds of tension, as envisioned by the\nCharter. Here we have in mind the practical and effective\napplication of the concept of collective security in the\ncontext of which regional conflicts are viewed as direct\nthreats to world peace and stability and not as mere threats\nto regional security. Therefore we demand that any conflict\nshould be dealt with firmly and expeditiously in order to\navoid its worsening, opening the door and allowing terrorism\nto fly in the face of international legality and flout the new\napproach.\nIt is in keeping with this conviction that Kuwait, despite\nits difficult circumstances, participates in the United Nations\nhumanitarian operations in Somalia, our sister country. Such\nparticipation bespeaks our commitment to the new United\nNations approach and our support for putting it into practice.\nKuwait considers that the international presence in Somalia\nis indispensable if the Somali people are to be saved from\ndestruction and chaos and if Somalia itself is to survive as\nan independent country. Indeed, the United Nations\npeace-keeping operations, which now total 17, as stated by\nthe Secretary-General in his report on the work of the\nOrganization (A/48/1), require from us all full material\nsupport, practical participation and political backing.\nAccordingly, the Government of Kuwait announces from this\npodium that it will voluntarily bear two thirds of the costs of\nthe United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n(UNIKOM). This is to demonstrate our firm belief in the\ntrue role of UNIKOM in safeguarding the security and peace\nin our region. It represents also a consolidation of the\nconcept of collective security and the United Nations role\ntherein.\nKuwait believes that the most important underpinnings\nof the new world approach are: compliance with established\nnorms of conduct in international relations; respect for the\nprinciples of international law; rejection of interference in\nthe internal affairs of other States; rejection of seeking gains\nand concessions at the expense of neighbouring countries;\nthe resolution of problems by dialogue rather than by force;\nand the renunciation of terrorism as a means of revenge.\nThe Iraqi regime invaded and occupied the State of\nKuwait. However, the adamant international will embodied\nby the United Nations helped liberate Kuwait in a historic\nact that led to a clean and tidy elimination of that horrendous\ncrime. Subsequently, Iraq accepted the consequences of its\ncrime as set out in Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\nwhich contains the provisions of fair and binding solutions\nfor the false Iraqi claims regarding Kuwait. It also outlines\nthe conditions for dealing with the consequences and\nunderlying reasons of the Iraqi invasion. The quintessence\nof resolution 687, which was accepted unconditionally by\nIraq, is the reaffirmation of the sovereignty and\nindependence of Kuwait. It also called for the utilization of\nUnited Nations technical assistance in the demarcation of\nboundaries between Kuwait and Iraq on the basis of the\ndocuments exchanged between the two countries in\nOctober 1963. In implementation of the provisions of the\nsaid resolution, the United Nations set up a Boundary\nDemarcation Commission which successfully completed its\nwork last May and has issued its final report which contains\nthe definitive map of land and maritime boundaries between\nKuwait and Iraq (document S/25811).\nKuwait commends the technical Boundary Demarcation\nCommission and pays tribute to its members for their\nimpartiality, dedication and patience, especially in the face\nof Iraqi accusations and provocations. Kuwait also pays\ntribute to the Security Council for adopting two historic\nresolutions this year. The first, resolution 806 (1993),\nextended the terms of reference of UNIKOM into a\npeace-keeping operation with full powers to prevent Iraqi\nraids into Kuwait and to put an end to riots instigated by the\nIraqi regime. Resolution 833 (1993), unanimously adopted\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter, reaffirms the commitment\nof the Security Council to guarantee the inviolability of the\ninternational boundary as demarcated by the United Nations\ntechnical commission and to consider that boundary as final\nand inviolable. By so doing, the Security Council has put an\nend to an amorphous situation which had lasted for far too\nlong and which Iraq exploited in a bid to secure territorial\nexpansion, to exercise regional hegemony, and to gain\npolitical, strategic and material concessions at the expense of\nKuwait and the other Gulf States. The demarcation of the\nboundary between Kuwait and Iraq is a major contribution\nby the international community to the elimination of a\nvolatile hotbed of regional tension which the Iraqi regime\nused to exploit in creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and\nmistrust and which culminated in its vicious invasion of the\nState of Kuwait.\nKuwait responded positively to the Secretary- General\u2019s\nacceptance of the outcome of the border demarcation\nprocess. In our response, we also reaffirmed our sincere\ncooperation with the United Nations despite the fact that\nKuwait had voted against some Commission decisions which\ndenied Kuwait its rights in Khowr Zhobeir. Iraq, for its part,\nresponded with two letters to the Secretary-General. The\nfirst in May 1992, following the demarcation of the land\nboundary, and the second in June 1993 following the\ndemarcation of the maritime boundary. Both letters\nreiterated previous Iraqi claims to what it calls its historical\nrights. Iraq also rejected the demarcation results and\nchallenged the integrity of the United Nations technical\nCommission and the validity of its procedures and work.\nThis prompted the Security Council to reprimand Iraq\nstrongly in a presidential statement which it issued on\n28 June 1993 and in which it rejected the contents of the\naforesaid Iraqi letters and reminded Iraq of its obligations\nunder resolution 687 (1991).\nIraq has unconditionally accepted resolution 687 (1991)\nin all its provisions and in so doing has undertaken legal,\npolitical and moral obligations on which it cannot renege,\nnor can it fail to abide by the consequences of such\nobligations because the functions of the technical\nCommission were not to the liking of its representative on\nthe Commission, who had participated fully, for a whole\nyear, in its work and deliberations and then chose to\nwithdraw from the Commission when he found himself\nunable to produce substantive documents corroborating\nIraq\u2019s claims, despite the fact that the Commission pressed\nhim to do so. The stance of the Iraqi regime constitutes a\nrebellion against Security Council resolutions in defiance of\nthe will of the Council and the international community.\nThis represents an egregious departure from the current\nglobal mainstream and warrants firm international resolve to\nreject the Iraqi regime\u2019s practices in both form and\nsubstance.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23\nI find it necessary now to emphasize in no uncertain\nterms that the Iraqi regime remains in its philosophy,\nbehaviour, thinking and nature a threat to regional and global\npeace and security. It persists in its aggressiveness while it\nthumbs its nose at the world community, which continues to\nreject and isolate it with sanctions. Kuwait has confidence\nin the wisdom of the Security Council and the ability of its\nmembers to fulfil their mandate. We trust that they are keen\nto ensure their collective commitment to the Security\nCouncil resolutions and thus compel the Iraqi regime to\nrecognize that it has no option but to begin the complete and\ndocumented implementation of all those resolutions to the\nletter. The Iraqi regime should be made to understand that\nits desperate endeavours to have the sanctions lifted will be\ntotally futile unless and until it clearly and legally complies\nwith the boundary demarcation decisions as set forth in the\nrelevant Council resolutions, especially resolutions 773\n(1992) and 833 (1993). The Iraqi regime must also meet\nother basic requirements, such as desisting from the false\nclaims made by its official information apparatus which\ncontinues to describe Kuwait as part of Iraq and to make\nother false claims to so-called historical rights. The\npersistence of and increase in such falsehoods, which\nemanate from ranking officials of that regime, is a reversal\nof and retreat from acceptance of the essence of resolution\n687 (1991), which represents Iraq\u2019s commitment to respect\nKuwait\u2019s sovereignty, independence and international\nborders. We have submitted regular reports to the Security\nCouncil containing complete verbatim excerpts of the claims\nmade by senior Iraqi officials and the official Iraqi media.\nWe call upon all Member States of the United Nations\nto welcome the relevant Security Council resolutions on the\nborder demarcation and the inviolability of boundaries as\nessential components of the regional security structure. We\nalso expect Member States to demand that the Iraqi regime\nrespect all relevant resolutions and link the lifting of\nsanctions with its implementation of all Security Council\nresolutions, particularly those regarding the boundary\ndemarcation and the release of prisoners.\nIn this context, I should like to recall that the\nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)\nissued at its last March session a statement welcoming the\ndemarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq. The\nGCC also underscored the demarcation as an underpinning\nof regional security. Furthermore, the Damascus Declaration\nStates, which include the six GCC countries together with\nEgypt and Syria, issued a statement last June supporting the\ndemarcation and welcoming the measures taken by the\nSecurity Council as positive contributions to stability and\nsecurity at both the regional and international levels.\nIraq\u2019s procrastination in implementing the Security\nCouncil resolutions is not limited to the boundary\ndemarcation but extends to a purely humanitarian issue: the\nrelease of all prisoners, hostages and detainees of Kuwaiti\nand third country nationals. Those hostages and prisoners\nhave been languishing in Iraqi prisons and detention camps\nfor some three years now. We trust and hope that the\ninternational community will bring pressure to bear on the\nIraqi regime to release every one of those innocent men,\nwomen and children. Their plight is a stark violation of all\nthe values and concepts associated with the issue of human\nrights. It is also a case that represents a rejection of the new\nglobal approach, which we believe all here are keen to\npromote with a view to safeguarding human rights in the\nworld.\nKuwait has explored all possible avenues, using all\navailable Arab, Islamic and international channels to\npersuade the Iraqi regime to comply with the norms of\ninternational law, especially its commitments under the\nGeneva Conventions. To date, the Iraqi regime has made no\npositive response to the efforts made by the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on behalf of those\npersons. Most recently, it boycotted a meeting organized by\nthe ICRC in Geneva last month to discuss the latest\ndevelopments of this important and urgent humanitarian\nmatter. The people of Kuwait will feel no relief and enjoy\nno peace of mind until the very last prisoner is returned to\nhis or her family and homeland.\nIraq has also failed to fulfil its obligation to return the\nremainder of Kuwaiti property belonging to the private and\npublic sectors in our country. Furthermore, it has neither\nimplemented Security Council resolutions 707 (1991) and\n715 (1991), nor has it desisted from oppressing and\nsuppressing its own population in the northern and the\nsouthern regions of the country. It continues to resort to acts\nof terrorism. We in Kuwait share the Iraqi people\u2019s pain\nand suffering by virtue of the brotherhood between our two\npeoples and our everlasting neighbourhood. It is with\nparticular concern that we see the humiliation of the Iraqi\npeople as the Iraqi regime pursues its atrocities with total\ndisregard for the plight of the Iraqi people and its future.\nThe Iraqi regime has stubbornly rejected the mechanism\nprovided to alleviate the suffering and hardships of the Iraqi\npeople by failing to implement Security Council resolutions\n706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Indeed, responsibility for the\nplight of the Iraqi people lies squarely on the regime itself,\nwhich must be held accountable for all the dire\nconsequences of its atrocities.\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nKuwait firmly believes that security in the Gulf region\nis part and parcel of world security. Hence, the international\ncommunity is responsible for ensuring respect for the\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States\nthat fall prey to aggression. Support for States that fall\nvictim to aggression should also be provided by the world\ncommunity when a conflict breaks out. The consolidation of\nregional security requires confidence-building among all\ncountries in the region as a basic premise for attaining that\ncommon goal. Here, I should like to underline the close ties\nand complete trust that exist among GCC States. Their\ncooperation is a substantial contribution to the stability and\nsecurity of the region. Facts on the ground attest to our\ncommon endeavours.\nKuwait is keen to improve its relations with the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran on the basis of the principles of\ngood-neighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs\nof each other and respect for sovereignty as specified by the\nGulf Cooperation Council Supreme Council. Having said\nthat, Kuwait would like to emphasize the sovereignty of the\nUnited Arab Emirates over its three islands - Abu Mousa,\nLesser Tonb and Greater Tonb. Furthermore, Kuwait wishes\nto put on record its absolute support for all the peaceful\nmeasures and means to which the United Arab Emirates\nresorts in order to regain sovereignty over its islands.\nKuwait remains hopeful that dialogue will eventually clear\naway all the outstanding matters between the two countries.\nWith that aim in view, Kuwait calls upon the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran to commit itself to resolving this dispute on\nthe basis of international law and treaties and to ending it by\npeaceful means.\nIn the context of the developments that are taking place\nwith regard to the Middle East peace process, Kuwait\nwelcomes the signing of the accord between the people of\nPalestine and Israel to exercise their right to self-\ndetermination, to free their territory from occupation and to\nbuild their own national institutions. In keeping with\nKuwait\u2019s support for every effort made and every avenue\nchosen by the Palestinian people to further their cause, the\nKuwaiti Council of Ministers has issued a statement in\nwhich it welcomed this first step towards the full\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nKuwait views this accord as a first step towards the\ncreation of a framework to deal with many details - a\nprocess that will require enormous effort and patience on the\npart of the parties directly involved if a successful\nconclusion is to be ensured. The accord has indeed ushered\nin a totally new chapter in the history of the Middle East\nand the question of Palestine. We hope that, in the new era,\nnegotiation will replace conflict; dialogue will supersede\nconfrontation; and that disputes will be resolved under the\nrule of international law instead of by force of arms, in\nconsonance with the developing new approach. However,\nthe litmus test will be in the steps that will follow and in the\nachievements that will be made on the other Arab fronts. In\nthe final analysis, partial or incomplete peace will not last,\nand a unilateral accord will not lead to a fair and\ncomprehensive peace. From now on we should not look to\nthe past with pain and sorrow; rather, we should look to the\nfuture with hope and confidence.\nIn the end, the success of the peace process hinges on\ngenuine and serious commitment on the part of Israel to\nimplement United Nations resolutions, particularly those that\ncall for complete and unconditional withdrawal from the\nSyrian Arab Golan. In the same vein, Israel must withdraw\nits forces from Southern Lebanon, without any further delay,\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nI take this opportunity to commend the Lebanese\nGovernment for its remarkable effort to build national\nreconciliation in Lebanon. For its part, Kuwait will continue\nto back the Lebanese people in their efforts to reconstruct\nand rehabilitate their homeland.\nThe tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\ncontinues unabated. That people is the target of brutal\naggression by the Serbs and the Croats, who want to impose\na fait accompli and to make territorial gains by imposing a\ngrossly unjust settlement on the Muslims of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nWe call upon the Security Council and the European\nCommunity to take all urgent and effective measures to\nprevent the aggressor from gaining any reward and to refuse\nto legitimize the outcome of outright aggression. We appeal\nto the international community to lift the embargo on arms\nsupplies to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to\nenable its people to exercise their right to self-defence, as set\nforth in the Charter of the United Nations.\nA few days ago, Kuwait was pleased to receive the\nPresident of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\nvisit was the culmination of Kuwait\u2019s constant support for\nthe struggle of that Muslim nation, and it demonstrated our\ndeep, comprehensive and unwavering commitment to Bosnia\nand Herzegovina.\nKuwait firmly welcomes the agreement that has been\nreached between the Government of President de Klerk and\nthe other parties involved in the negotiations on the future\npolitical and social structure in South Africa. The thrust of\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 25\nthis accord is to end the system of apartheid, which divides\nsociety into segments whose rights and prerogatives are\nbased on the colour of their skin. We applaud this historic\nagreement, which will put all the people of South Africa,\nirrespective of class, on a totally new humanitarian cause,\nenabling all South Africans to unleash their energies in the\nbuilding of a new society.\nFor its part, Kuwait has complied fully with all the\nboycott regulations. Together with other members of the\ninternational community, it contributed to the creation of the\neffective mechanism that eventually led to the agreement in\nquestion. Now we intend to take the necessary measures on\nthe national level to lift sanctions in response to\nMr. Nelson Mandela\u2019s recent appeal from this rostrum. Our\naction will be in line with the global trend towards the\ncreation of conditions conducive to the\nfulfilment of the targets set out in the agreement. My\nGovernment will review Kuwaiti national legislation that\nprohibits dealings with the Government of South Africa, in\nthe light of the national agreement in South Africa,\ninternational consensus and the important statement in which\nMr. Nelson Mandela called for an end to the economic\nsanctions while continuing to maintain the ban on\nconventional and nuclear weapons.\nWe welcome also the proposal by the Multilateral\nNegotiating Council and the agreement that has been reached\nto enable the young Republic of Namibia to have its\nterritorial rights in respect of Walvis Bay and the off-shore\nislands restored.\nParallel to the heart-warming transformations on the\nworld political arena, there are some significant economic\nindicators. The issues relating to the world economic\nsituation are of great concern to my Government. In our\nview, top priority must be given, on the international\neconomic agenda, to the economic plight of the developing\ncountries, especially the most impoverished among them, so\nthat they may be helped to alleviate the severe suffering of\ntheir populations.\nConvinced that the future of the world and the well-\nbeing of its inhabitants require wholesome approaches that\nbalance the use of resources with conservation of the\nenvironment, Kuwait has played an active role in the\ninternational forums dealing with the questions of the\nenvironment and energy. We are extremely keen on the\npromotion of international cooperation with a view to\nachieving wider development and removing obstacles that\nimpede it. We believe, however, that priority should be\naccorded to national and international efforts that aim at\nachieving overall social and economic development and\nincreasing political stability.\nThe individual must always be the focus of every\ndevelopment effort. All development policies should be\nflexible enough to accommodate the ingenuity and creative\npower of all individuals. This is indeed our guarantee of\nprogress and excellence in human endeavour. International\ninstitutions should provide the platform and the framework\nto harness our national efforts towards that end.\nThe new international orientation, in its political and\neconomic aspects, presents us with yet another window of\nopportunity. As interdependent partners, we should forge\nahead together so that, together, we may reap the common\nbenefits of the new order.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Namibia, I wish to extend our\ndeepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the\nGovernment and friendly people of India on the heavy loss\nof life and destruction of property that resulted from the\ndevastating earthquake. I trust that the international\ncommunity will give them a full helping hand.\nNamibia welcomes all the newest Members of the\nOrganization and assures them of its readiness to interact\nwith them in the spirit of friendship and solidarity.\nThe President of the Assembly hails from a friendly\ncountry, Guyana, which did so much to spearhead the\nstruggle of the Namibian people for self-determination,\nliberation and democracy. The Government and people of\nGuyana spared no effort in manifesting, in word and deed,\ntheir unswerving support for and solidarity with the\nNamibian cause in different world forums. I know all this\nbecause I have spent many years at the United Nations and\nduring this time I visited Georgetown, his nation\u2019s capital,\nand other parts of Guyana on more than one occasion. The\nhospitality and camaraderie of his brotherly people always\ntouched me very deeply. In his past and present incarnations\nin the service of his great country, he and I have\ncollaborated on various issues of common interest. It is\nagainst this background of mutual friendship and solidarity,\ntherefore, that I congratulate him most warmly on his\nbrilliant election as President of this challenging session of\nthe Assembly. His sterling stewardship is already so\neffectively manifest that the successful conclusion of our\ndeliberations is assured.\nI also wish to place on record our sincere appreciation\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, for the effective leadership he provided last\nsession.\nOur illustrious Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has since his appointment been spearheading\nan effective and innovative global campaign aimed at\nstreamlining and strengthening the role of the United Nations\nin peace-keeping operations and in economic and\nhumanitarian issues. His \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has provided\na useful framework for discussing these and other pressing\nissues relating to the maintenance of world peace and\nsecurity. Namibia commends the Secretary-General for his\ntireless efforts.\nOn the threshold of a new millennium, and as we are\nabout to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, it is an appropriate time to reflect and take stock.\nThis is a period of great hope and confidence in the efficacy\nof the United Nations. New vision and foresight are thus\ncalled for; bold and imaginative decisions are required.\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly, in\nresolution 47/62, on the \\\"Question of equitable representation\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council\\\",\nrecognized that in the changing global situation there was a\nneed to reorganize, revitalize and democratize the Security\nCouncil. The end of the cold war has created new\nexpectations that the Security Council will take on larger\nresponsibilities and a greater role in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. But if the Security Council\nis to be a credible organ of the United Nations, it must fulfil\nthese expectations of a changing and demanding world. It\nis with this in mind that the \\\"Question of equitable\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the\nSecurity Council\\\" should be addressed. Changes towards a\nmore representative Council would, no doubt, enhance its\ncredibility, legitimacy and authority.\nNamibia supports the view that the membership of the\nSecurity Council should be increased and more permanent\nand non-permanent members added, taking into consideration\nequitable geographical representation. Africa itself needs an\neffective presence on the Council, as do Asia and Latin\nAmerica. The outmoded and undemocratic veto power\nshould be abolished altogether.\nLikewise, there is a compelling need for the\nrestructuring of other organs, such as the General Assembly\nitself and the Economic and Social Council. The member\nStates of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, working\nin close partnership with the Group of 77, should involve\nthemselves fully in the ongoing discussions on the\nrestructuring of these vital organs of the United Nations.\nToday we are witnessing a new phenomenon in\ninternational relations, characterized by a sense of consensus\nderiving from shared interests, in which the credibility and\ncentrality of the United Nations in dealing with global\nconflicts has been greatly enhanced. Indeed, we have\nwitnessed the Organization fulfilling its mandate in the area\nof the maintenance of international peace and security.\nWe in Namibia believe that now is the opportune\nmoment to establish a new role and purpose for a conflict-\nresolution mechanism which is appropriate to the post-cold-\nwar era and to the needs and aspirations of succeeding\ngenerations. The renewed commitment towards conflict\nresolution must be transformed into a realistic programme of\naction, relating to preventive diplomacy, peacemaking,\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\npeace-keeping and peace-building. Humanity is yearning for\na peaceful, just and prosperous world. On this score,\nNamibia envisages a meaningful partnership and enhanced\ncooperation between the Secretary-General of the United\nNations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity in the field of conflict resolution and\nhumanitarian relief operations in Africa.\nNow more than ever, much is expected of the United\nNations in the area of conflict resolution. The Organization\nhas a golden opportunity to ensure that those expectations\nwhich \\\"We the peoples\\\" set forth in the Charter, are met by\nfurther enhancing its effectiveness.\nIt is an accepted fact that peace and stability are\nnecessary, albeit not sufficient, conditions for economic\ndevelopment. Therefore, peace-keeping, peacemaking and\npeace-building should go hand in hand with economic\ndevelopment.\nFor peace-keeping operations to be effective, Member\nStates should pay promptly their assessed contributions to\nthe regular budget and to peace-keeping operations. In this\ncontext, we support the establishment of the reserve fund\naimed at improving the start-up financing of peace-keeping\noperations.\nIn Cambodia, the United Nations Transitional Authority\nin Cambodia (UNTAC) accomplished its task satisfactorily.\nNamibia was happy to have contributed polling officers and\na staffed contingent of reinforced vehicles, called wolves, to\nUNTAC. We did this because it was, after all, in Namibia\nthat a United Nations peace-keeping operation scored its first\nlarge-scale victory. Namibia will favourably consider\nparticipation in future United Nations peace-keeping\noperations.\nUnfortunately, other peace-keeping operations have not\nas yet achieved the same positive results. It is our hope that\nthe United Nations will continue to help resolve the conflicts\nin Somalia, Angola, Rwanda, Liberia, Mozambique, Haiti\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others.\nWith regard to Angola, Mr. Savimbi\u2019s rejection of last\nyear\u2019s election results was a major set-back. It has plunged\nthat sister country further into a most horrible human\ntragedy. The horrendous carnage there continues to claim\nabout 1,000 innocent lives a day. It is further reported that\nfrom 2 million to 3 million innocent Angolans are at risk of\ndying of either direct or indirect effects of this senseless\nwar.\nThe international community must exert concerted\npressure on Mr. Savimbi to accept the will of the Angolan\npeople without any further delay. What is now expected of\nMr. Savimbi is the speedy implementation of the Bicesse\nAccords, the relevant Security Council resolutions, the\nAbidjan Protocol and last year\u2019s election results, which,\ntaken together, provide the framework for resuming\nnegotiations with the Angolan Government.\nIt is the view of the Namibian Government that the\nresumption of negotiations should lead to an early cease-fire,\nwhich will allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance to\nthe suffering Angolan people, reconciliation and\nconsolidation of the Government of National Unity.\nTo this end, and in the face of Mr. Savimbi\u2019s persistent\nintransigence, the Security Council had no other alternative\nbut to impose sanctions against UNITA. Namibia, therefore,\nsupports Security Council resolution 864 (1993) which, inter\nalia, calls for the prohibition of all sale or supply to UNITA\nof arms and related materi\u00e9l and military assistance, as well\nas petroleum and petroleum products, and urges all Member\nStates to implement these measures. We believe also that if\nUNITA continues to flout Security Council resolutions,\nadditional forms of punitive sanctions should be imposed.\nConcerning the situation in Somalia, Namibia supports\nthe United Nations peace-keeping operation there. My\ndelegation holds the view that disarming the various factions\nwould allow the people of Somalia to build genuine bridges\nof reconciliation and bring about the restoration of a civil\nsociety.\nUnder the present circumstances, and in spite of\nprovocations by General Aidid\u2019s faction, the United Nations\nOperation in Somalia should continue to carry out its\nmandate. Our hearts go out in sympathy to all those\ncountries whose nationals, including innocent Somalis, have\nmade the supreme sacrifice in the service of the United\nNations and human brotherhood. Any precipitous\nwithdrawal, however, would be to the detriment of innocent\nSomali people and is likely to reverse the whole process.\nThis should not be allowed to happen.\nIn Mozambique, we are encouraged to note that the\ncease-fire continues to hold and that the process appears to\nbe moving forward. I can hardly overemphasize that it is\nabsolutely imperative for elections to be conducted in an\natmosphere of peace, trust and cooperation - and this means\nthat the armed forces must first be confined to base and\ndemobilized, in accordance with the General Peace\nAgreement agreed to last year by the two parties.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 21\nNamibia welcomes with satisfaction the recent\nencouraging developments that have taken place in South\nAfrica. For the first time in the history of that neighbouring\ncountry, all the people of South Africa will finally\nparticipate in a free and democratic election on 27 April next\nyear. We would like, nevertheless, to urge all the people of\nSouth Africa to ensure that this process remains on course,\nand we call upon all the parties to participate in the work of\nthe Transitional Executive Council. In the same vein, we\ncall upon them, with the assistance of the international\ncommunity, to put an immediate end to the ever-escalating\nviolence. Violence and the ballot box do not go together.\nNamibia, along with the other members of the Ad Hoc\nCommittee on Southern Africa of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, supports the call made by the President of the\nAfrican National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, to lift all\nremaining economic sanctions against South Africa.\nNamibia further supports the lifting of the oil embargo after\nthe establishment and commencement of the work of the\nTransitional Executive Council, as well as the establishment\nor restoration of full diplomatic relations with South Africa,\nfollowing the installation of an elected Interim Government\nof National Unity, pursuant to democratic elections next\nyear.\nThe Middle East, the cradle of some of the world\u2019s\nmajor religions, has witnessed bloody conflicts for the\ngreater part of this century and has been on the agenda of\nthe United Nations since its inception. Namibia welcomes\nthe historic breakthrough represented by mutual recognition\nand the declaration of principles signed between Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on Palestinian\nself-rule in Gaza and the city of Jericho. Despite their long\nenmity, the leaders of the State of Israel and the PLO\nsummoned the political courage to embrace peace. We can\nonly hope that the historic handshake between Mr. Rabin,\nPrime Minister of Israel, and Mr. Arafat, Chairman of the\nPLO, will usher in a new era in that region.\nGranted, this is only a first step, but it constitutes a\nfirm basis for building a comprehensive, just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East. However, for this undertaking to\nsucceed, the infusion of large-scale and sustained\ninternational financial and humanitarian assistance is\nrequired.\nEncouraged by the historic and momentous\nbreakthrough in the Middle East and the positive\ndevelopments in South Africa, and also taking into\nconsideration the emerging climate in favour of\nrapprochement in inter-State relations, we believe that the\ntime has now come for the leaders of the United States of\nAmerica and the Republic of Cuba to travel the short\ndistance of 90 miles to reconciliation and peaceful\ncoexistence. We are convinced that this can be done in the\ninterest of the children of the two countries, who, like those\nof South Africa, Israel and Palestine, hope for a peaceful and\nbrighter future.\nPeace and stability in the Middle East are critically\nimportant not only to that region but also to the world as a\nwhole. In this context, Namibia associates itself with\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993) of 27 May 1993,\ndealing with the territorial integrity of Kuwait and\ninviolability of its borders. We reiterate our full support for\nthe right of the people of Kuwait and its Government to\ndefend their sovereignty and independence. Namibia is a\nsmall State, and we understand the predicament of small\nStates.\nDuring the last session, I updated this august Assembly\non the progress made in our bilateral negotiations with the\nGovernment of South Africa on the issue of the transfer and\nreintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands into\nNamibia. Today, I am happy to report that the matter has\nfinally been resolved. On 28 February 1994, the transfer\nand reintegration of Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands\ninto Namibia will take place. This will, at last, mark the\ncompletion of the decolonization of Namibia and the\nunification of our nation. I take this opportunity to express\nour deep appreciation to the Member States for their\nconsistent support, over the years, of Security Council\nresolution 432 (1978) on Walvis Bay. I would also like to\nthank, in particular, the South African Multi-Party\nNegotiating Forum for adopting an important resolution\nwhich speeded up this process.\nThe Rio Earth Summit marked an historic turning-point\nin the long struggle to increase international awareness about\nthe true nature of the global environmental crisis. The\nSummit effectively moved a long way towards a better\nunderstanding of how future economic development is\ninextricably linked to sound policies aimed at promoting and\nprotecting the environment.\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nTo this end, and in line with the provisions of our\nConstitution, Namibia has launched a countrywide\nprogramme of tree planting to prevent further deforestation\nand degradation of the environment. Naturally, Namibia,\nlike the other developing countries, is anxious to see\ngenerous financing and implementing of Agenda 21.\nLet me now turn to the socio-economic problems we\nare facing today. Despite the promise world leaders made\nto children at the World Summit for Children here in New\nYork in 1990, education, health, water, shelter and food\nsecurity remain inaccessible to millions of children in the\ndeveloping world - and Namibia is no exception.\nIn Africa, problems of hunger, malnutrition, disease,\nand so on, continue to thwart the commitment we made last\nyear at Dakar during the International Conference on\nAssistance for the African Child, to place children first. In\nfurtherance of this commitment, and convinced that the\nproblems of the Namibian children can be addressed only in\na comprehensive manner, we have already integrated the\nNational Programme of Action on children into the overall\nNational Development Plan. This National Development\nPlan constitutes the basis for social and economic\ndevelopment in Namibia. In this context, primary health\ncare, education, provision of water and rural development\nare among the priorities of our National Development Plan.\nThe 20/20 Vision programme we adopted at Dakar\nmust be implemented if we are to achieve tangible results by\nthe year 1995, when we shall review progress made since\nthe 1990 World Summit, including in particular the fate and\nwelfare of those children engulfed in war situations.\nThe recent World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna has further exposed the unmitigated violence and\nother forms of injustice being perpetrated against women\nthroughout the world. The Namibian Constitution contains\nspecific provisions on protection of the rights of women and\npromotion of their welfare. Furthermore, Namibia is a party\nto the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women.\nIt is against this background that we in Namibia have\ntaken measures to raise women\u2019s awareness of their rights\nby translating this Convention into indigenous languages. In\nthe same vein, we applaud the appointment of the Special\nRapporteur to study the issue of violence against women. It\nis with this in mind that Namibia looks forward to the\nFourth World Conference on Women, in anticipation that its\ndecisions will further advance the cause of women in the\nworld, especially in Africa.\nThese are some of the many concerns on the social\nagenda of all nations. Thus to us, the appointment of a\nUnited Nations commissioner for human rights makes much\nsense, and we support the idea. At the same time, we would\nlike to urge everyone to ensure that the mandate and status\nof such a high-level international civil servant should be\nconsidered carefully and realistically.\nIn order to meet the acute shortages of housing, the\nGovernment has embarked upon a programme to provide\nadequate housing to the Namibian people by the year 2000.\nIn recognition of this national effort, Namibia was awarded\nthe Habitat Scroll of Honour for 1993 for our National\nHousing Programme, called \\\"Build Together\\\". This award\nwas received by my distinguished colleague, the Honourable\nMrs. Libertine Amathila, Minister of Local and Regional\nGovernment and Housing, two days ago. I would like to\necho the words of my colleague by thanking Habitat for this\noutstanding honour.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my Government\u2019s\nbelief that the United Nations, as a unique international\nbody, can live up to its lofty ideals of creating a peaceful,\nsecure and just world for us and for generations to come.\nTo this end, Namibia pledges its total commitment.\n"

His personal qualifications and\ndiplomatic experience are valuable assets, which must be\nutilized fully and seriously to further the purposes of the\nUnited Nations. I wish to assure the President of my\ndelegation\u2019s unreserved cooperation in this common\nendeavour.\nI should like also to welcome the new Members of the\nOrganization and to express the hope that their participation\nin this body will enhance its universality and strengthen the\nspirit of universality and international cooperation. As\ninternational relations are currently undergoing tumultuous\nand decisive change, the presence here of representatives of\nthe overwhelming majority of nation States provides the\nGeneral Assembly at this session with a unique opportunity\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nto shape a better future and an international environment\nmore in keeping with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations.\nOf course, such a rare opportunity is accompanied by\na grave and historic responsibility for every one of us. We\nmust acquire a full understanding of the transitional nature\nof international relations in the world of today, and, relying\non our vast collective resources and potential, we must\nprevent the resurgence and prevalence of the crises, wars,\ninjustices and human misery that have marred the first\n50 years of the United Nations.\nIf, on the eve of its fiftieth anniversary, we are to\nensure a more dynamic and successful future for the\nOrganization, we must undertake a sober reassessment of our\nrecord and identify our achievements as well as our\nshortcomings and obstacles. Regrettably, five years after the\nend of the cold war, some of that era\u2019s most negative\ncharacteristics are still evident in international relations.\nExpansionism and the urge to dominate, disregard for\nthe material, cultural and moral values of nations, the\nsuppression of democracy and of democratic institutions, and\nthe triumph of the short-sighted interests of the dominant\nfew over the interests and aspirations of the majority and\nover human rights and the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law continue to impede international affairs\nand, most regrettably, international organizations. This has\npresented the United Nations with a historic challenge: to\nmaintain and enhance its perceived role and its credibility\nfollowing the Persian Gulf crisis. Moreover, despite the\ncessation of military rivalry between major Powers, many\ncomplex and grave threats - including those arising from\nethnic tensions, the lack of development, poverty, economic\nand social inequality and degradation of the environment -\nhave taken humanity to the edge of the abyss.\nDuring the era of the cold war, relations between East\nand West - and, consequently, international relations in\ngeneral - were founded on misconceptions, mutual mistrust\nand a total lack of confidence. These factors played a\ncentral role in the creation of an unsafe world, in which the\nUnited Nations was deprived of any opportunity to realize its\nvast potential for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\nTherefore, our first and foremost obligation is to\nidentify and root out the causes of crisis and mistrust\ninherited from the cold war and to take appropriate steps to\ncreate the conditions necessary to the promotion of\nunderstanding and the fostering of mutual confidence at the\ninternational level.\nThis should begin with an all-out campaign of steps to\nrestore world confidence in the United Nations. A balanced,\nobjective and far-sighted approach to various international\npolitical, economic and cultural crises and challenges, based\non justice and on the common principles and objectives\nenshrined in the Charter, is the most fundamental\nrequirement for the restoration and enhancement of the\ncredibility of the Organization, and can also play a\nsignificant role in securing long-term stability and trust. In\nthis context, the identification, definition and deepening of\nshared values and common interests will facilitate\nunderstanding and ensure international cooperation.\nShould we fail in adopting such an approach, countries\nwill be forced into a security dilemma created by\nunacceptable survival options: namely, either to strengthen\ntheir military capabilities and thus precipitate an arms race\nor to succumb to expansionist Powers and their whims. In\neither case, the world will plunge into a new era of\ninsecurity and turbulence.\nThe Security Council plays a determining role in either\nheightening such a dilemma or reversing it. In other words,\nthe Council may either exacerbate tension and distrust or\nencourage understanding, confidence and respect for the rule\nof law in inter-State relations.\nIf the behaviour of the Security Council signifies an\nunequivocal commitment to uphold justice and the principles\nof the Charter, to combat aggression and to come to the help\nof the victims, and if the Council exhibits the political will\nto cease the application of double standards, then we can\nhope that potential aggressors will be deterred, international\ninstability and insecurity will be curtailed, and the immense\nhuman cost of wars and hostilities will be avoided.\nOn the other hand, when, owing to political\ncalculations, some aggressions and international crimes meet\nwith the indifference and acquiescence of the Security\nCouncil; when the criteria for resort to forcible measures\nenvisaged in Chapter VII of the Charter are the short-lived\npolitical interests of Powers; when aggressions and attempts\nto annihilate an entire nation do not receive a forcible,\nresolute response, while in other cases there is a rush to\nresort to force before attempting to understand and deal with\nthe root causes of a conflict; and, finally, when some\ndecisions of the Council are enforced with vigour and\ndetermination while others remain dead letters for years;\nthen no one can expect potential aggressors or possible\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 21\nvictims of foreign expansionism to form a reliable\nexpectation with regard to the reaction of the Security\nCouncil. Thus, having removed the credibility of the\ndeterrence factor, we should expect nothing but the\npersistence of aggression and expansionism and the\nexacerbation of the ensuing horrific human tragedies,\ninevitably leading to undesirable implications for the\nauthority and credibility of the United Nations.\nThe failure of the Security Council squarely to face the\nPalestinian crisis and the constant aggressions against the\nPalestinian people, Lebanon and Syria, not to mention its\nintentional failure to enforce its own resolutions, are a sad\nillustration of the prevailing preference of political interests\nover peace, security, international law and equity. Relying\non the support of a number of powerful States, Israel has\nwith impunity totally disregarded pertinent Security Council\nresolutions, unabatedly pursued a militaristic policy, persisted\nin aggression and expansionism and avoided any\ncommitment to international nuclear non-proliferation\nregimes. It is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the\nregion. It has systematically and grossly violated the most\nelemental human rights of the Palestinian people and\nemployed terrorism in all its forms as an official policy.\nThese are facts, borne out by history and solidly based on\nobjective international observations and internationally\ndocumented evidence. Israel\u2019s well orchestrated\nmisinformation campaign against others and its attempts to\nfan the flames of discord, distrust and division among States\nin the region cannot conceal these facts, nor should they\nlegitimize the unrealistic, short-sighted and imposed plans as\nsolutions or mechanisms to return peace and stability to the\nregion.\nIn our view, peace, stability and mutual confidence can\nreturn to the Middle East and to the Holy Land of Peace and\nRevelation only through a serious and even-handed treatment\nof these realities and the full restoration of the inalienable\nrights of the Palestinian people. Based on these objective\nhistorical realities, the recent accord, notwithstanding the\ninternational fanfare, does not present a realistic solution to\nthe root causes of the conflict, does not promise restoration\nof Palestinian rights, and thus cannot establish justice, which\nis the only foundation of a lasting peace. And no one can\ncede Palestine on behalf of the Palestinian people or\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif on behalf of the Muslims. We consider\nthe signing of this accord as a conspiracy against Islam and\nPalestine, and we disagree with it.\nThe unfolding human tragedy in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is yet further disturbing evidence of the\nconsequences of the Security Council\u2019s acquiescence in\naggression, and failure resolutely to tackle the causes of the\nabhorrent attempt to annihilate an entire nation. In the face\nof aggression, genocide, rape and indiscriminate murder in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Security Council, ignoring\nrepeated calls by the General Assembly, has failed to fulfil\nits international responsibility and has even deprived the\nvictims of the means to defend themselves. The Council,\nprevented from action by the illusions and imaginary\ninterests of a number of its permanent members, can\ncertainly not justify this approach by hiding behind the\nconvenient excuse of the existence of civil war. That excuse\nis unacceptable, at the least because of the fact that the very\nsame Council, in a much more complex situation of civil\nstrife in Somalia - where the identification of victim and\nculprit is far more difficult - has not only acted but has\npractically given total management of a United Nations\noperation to a single country, which, motivated by its own\nperceived interests, has undertaken massive operations whose\nmain victims are, ironically, the same innocent and deprived\npeople for whose help and protection the operation\nostensibly started.\nNow that, owing to the lack of serious action by the\ninternational community, the Bosnian Muslims have been\nforced into unbalanced negotiations under military and,\nunfortunately, diplomatic duress, it is imperative for the\nAssembly and the Security Council to take appropriate\nmeasures to guarantee the viability of the Government and\nMuslim people of Bosnia. The lifting of the arms embargo\nagainst the Bosnian Government and strengthening the\ndefensive capabilities of the Bosnian Muslims are, in our\nview, the most effective guarantees for the durability of any\npeaceful settlement and the prevention of future aggressions.\nFurthermore, reiteration of the principles which should\nunderlie any peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nis necessary to induce or, if necessary, to compel the\naggressors to participate seriously in negotiations for a\nlasting and acceptable solution. They include, most\nparticularly, the establishment of a durable cease-fire; the\nlifting of the siege of cities; unhindered access to\nhumanitarian assistance; the rejection of acquisition of\nterritory by force or ethnic cleansing; the necessity for the\nevacuation of territories thus occupied; the recognition of the\nright of the people and Government of Bosnia to seek and\nreceive compensation and reparations; the honourable and\nsafe repatriation of refugees; and individual responsibility for\nwar crimes.\nIn the light of these recent unfortunate experiences and\nin order to enhance the credibility of the United Nations,\nparticularly in the crucial area of peace and security, it is\nimperative to review and reconsider the behaviour,\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\noperational framework and rules of procedure of the Security\nCouncil. There should be no room for undemocratic\npractices, hidden agendas, a lack of transparency or\nindifference to the views of the international community, as\nreflected in the General Assembly. It should never be\nforgotten that it is the entire membership - represented only\nin the General Assembly - which, to quote Article 24 of the\nCharter,\n\\\"In order to ensure prompt and effective action by\nthe United Nations ... [has conferred] on the Security\nCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security\\\".\nThe Council acts, in the words of Article 24, on\n\\\"behalf\\\" of the membership. Its powers emanate from that\nrole and not from any inherent right. Therefore, it is\naccountable to the entire membership gathered in the\nGeneral Assembly. In today\u2019s international climate, the\nprimacy of political interests and their tendency to\novershadow the interests of the public has generated grave\nconcerns about the Council\u2019s ability to take \\\"prompt and\neffective action\\\". The General Assembly must therefore\nfully and deliberately exercise its prerogatives in this regard\nas the highest organ of the United Nations.\nConfidence-building measures by the United Nations\nshould not be limited only to the realm of international peace\nand security. Indeed, a multi-dimensional approach is\nnecessary to root out the seeds of tension and mistrust sown\nin the previous era. In this context, it is most important to\ntake positive, comprehensive and objective steps for\ninternational promotion and protection of human rights and\ndemocratic institutions, for controlling and reducing\narmaments, for combating the drug menace, for protecting\nthe environment, for eradicating poverty, for improving the\ndeteriorating economic plight of the South and for\nengendering sustainable development. Success in these areas\nwould not only enhance the credibility and authority of the\nOrganization, but would also remove the most tangible\ncauses of mistrust and tension in the world at large.\nIn spite of significant achievements in the international\ncampaign to promote respect for the exalted worth of the\nhuman person and the realization and attainment of the\nmoral and material rights of that masterpiece of creation,\nformidable challenges continue to persist in the task of\nensuring respect for the most basic rights of millions of\nhuman beings: the right to life and the right to a minimum\nof moral and material welfare. The World Conference on\nHuman Rights, recently held in Vienna, provided a valuable\nopportunity for the world community to take stock of its\nachievements and shortcomings in the quarter of a century\nfollowing the first such conference, held in Tehran in 1968.\nThe Conference addressed vital issues, such as respect for\nthe moral, cultural and religious values of all nations, the\nindivisibility of all human rights, and the rejection of\nselectivity, application of double-standards and the political\nmanipulation of human rights. While not ideal, the work of\nthe Conference can play a constructive role in enhancing\ninternational protection and promotion of human rights and\nthe progressive development of human-rights norms.\nIn the logic of the divine religions - and particularly\nIslam, which pioneered the campaign to respect and value\nthe exalted worth of the human being as God\u2019s Vice-Regent\non Earth - human rights are vested in the human nature\nbestowed upon mankind by the Almighty Creator. Hence,\nnot only are they universal and independent of geographical\nand temporal boundaries, but they do not have their origin\nin conventions. Therefore, their definition, codification,\nimplementation and international promotion and protection\ncannot be considered the private domain of the few who\nenjoy temporary political and military superiority. That is\nparticularly true as those States do not have a shining record\nin internal or external protection of human rights and do not\noffer in their own social experience a suitable moral and\nmaterial environment for the welfare of human beings. If\nviolence and crime, which deprive the most vulnerable\nsegments of society of their right to life and dignity - I refer\nhere to the drug menace, prostitution, pornography, rape,\nviolence and other forms of abuse of women, the\ndisintegration of families, profanity and vulgarity as well as\ndebasing of social relations - are at least the byproducts of\nthe human-rights model advocated, or indeed imposed, by\nthat group, then others certainly have the right to examine\nthe prototype critically before importing it.\nThe universality of human rights is the very opposite of\narrogating to oneself the task of setting the standards for\nhuman rights and of judging their observance by others,\nparticularly since even these standards are not promoted\nuniversally and across the board, but are, rather, resorted to\nwhen and if the exigencies of foreign policy and economic\nand security interests require it.\nHuman rights and the inherent worth of the human\nperson are too important to be subjugated to short-lived\npolitical considerations and interests or used as a lever for\npolitical or cultural pressure or for maintaining the inequity\nbetween the South and the North. That can only erode their\ncredibility and universal acceptance. We hope that political\nwill and responsible behaviour by all countries, specifically\nthe countries of the North, will preclude a selective approach\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 23\nto the Vienna Declaration and enable the international\ncommunity to employ its collective potential to reach\ncommon understanding in this area and initiate a truly\nuniversal campaign for the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights.\nAnother vestige of the cold-war era, which constitutes\nan elemental cause of international mistrust and a general\nlack of confidence, is the arms race and the development,\nproduction, build-up and use of weapons, particularly\nweapons of mass destruction - all in the misplaced hope of\nenhancing national security.\nThe conclusion of the comprehensive Convention on\nchemical weapons, notwithstanding its shortcomings, was a\nhistoric achievement. Iran, the most recent victim of the\nlarge-scale use of chemical weapons, actively contributed in\nthe drafting process, was among the sponsors of the relevant\nresolution in the General Assembly, and was among the first\nsignatories of this important international instrument. The\neffectiveness and universality of the Convention will be a\nfunction of the way in which it is implemented and of the\ndegree of commitment of its signatories.\nNaturally, with the conclusion of this Convention, the\nexisting informal regimes which impose discriminatory\nbarriers on free trade in the chemical industry have lost their\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre and must be dismantled. The lingering of\nthese regimes not only violates the spirit of the Convention\nand the understandings reached during the process of its\nfinalization, but also nullifies the positive incentives for\nacceding to that instrument. The same applies to unilateral\nand illegal measures such as the disruption of the free\nnavigation of the Chinese vessel Yinhe, in the Persian Gulf,\non the pretext - subsequently proven false - that it was\ncarrying prohibited chemical substances. Such actions can\nonly lead to the erosion of the authority and credibility of\nthe Convention.\nInternational efforts to prevent the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons face a similar danger. Politically motivated\nand unfounded accusations against signatory States which are\ncommitted to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons simply undermine that important instrument and\nlead to international mistrust and the escalation of the arms\nrace. Before any decision on the extension of the NonProliferation Treaty in 1995, the process leading to the\nReview Conference should be fully utilized in order\nseriously to assess the Treaty\u2019s record during the past two\ndecades in the light of its overall objective of totally\neliminating nuclear weapons. The shortcomings and\nobstacles hindering progress towards this goal should be\nidentified and dealt with during the Conference in 1995.\nAmong the most essential and useful strategies for\nattaining global disarmament and strengthening the\nnon-proliferation regime is the creation of zones free from\nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in various\nparts of the world. In the light of the constant support of the\nUnited Nations for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone\nin the Middle East, an idea initiated by Iran in 1974, it is\nnecessary to take constructive and practical measures\ntowards establishing such a zone. The institutionalization of\nregional confidence-building measures, including placement\nof all facilities and installations under the safeguards\nmechanism of the International Atomic Energy Agency and\naccession by all regional States to all international\ndisarmament instruments, particularly the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty and the chemical weapons Convention, constitute the\nmost important elements for the establishment of a zone free\nfrom nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the\nMiddle East.\nFurthermore, the reckless build-up of conventional\nweapons has not only devoured much needed resources, but\nalso reinforced the atmosphere of mistrust and anxiety.\nDifferent areas have, as a result, become fair ground for\npolitical, economic and commercial exploitation by countries\nand companies that manufacture weapons. The decision of\nthe General Assembly to establish a Register of\nConventional Arms Transfers constitutes a positive first step\nwhich should be strengthened and further refined.\nHowever, it is evident that transparency in armaments\ncannot by itself control horizontal or vertical proliferation of\nconventional weapons in the world. Therefore, what is\nreally necessary, globally and particularly in the Middle\nEast, is serious and genuine international cooperation for the\ncomprehensive, non-selective, non-discriminatory, balanced\nand effective reduction of conventional arms. This may be\nrealized, inter alia, through the reduction of military budgets,\nof weapons procurement and of the presence of foreign\nforces in different regions. The Islamic Republic of Iran has\nbeen cited by impartial international sources as the country\nwith the lowest defence budget in the region and the fewest\nweapons purchases. As such, Iran is naturally prepared to\nengage constructively in any serious, practical and\nnon-sensational collective effort in this regard.\nAbove and beyond all these steps, it is most essential\nto generate the necessary political will to formulate and\ndirect national policies geared towards fostering an\ninternational atmosphere of mutual confidence. This can be\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nrealized only by basing national policies on a commitment\nto the rules and principles of international law, particularly\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others;\nthe inviolability of internationally recognized boundaries;\nrejection of the threat or use of force for the settlement of\ndisputes; non-interference in the internal affairs of others;\nand refraining from advancing unfounded claims against the\nterritory of other States. The positive impact of such an\napproach on promoting good-neighbourly relations,\nencouraging regional cooperation and the enhancement of\nsecurity is self-evident.\nConsistent with its national and strategic interests, and\ncognizant of its heavy responsibility in this region, the\nIslamic Republic of Iran has historically acted as the force\nfor stability in the Persian Gulf region. Domestically, the\ngreatest part of the national budget has been allocated to\neconomic, social and cultural development projects and\nreconstruction. The policy of converting military industries\nto civilian use and employing the armed forces in the\nreconstruction sector has been vigorously pursued. Thus,\ndespite serious obstacles, fundamental progress has been\nachieved in across-the-board development of the country and\nreconstruction of war-damaged property. Similarly, in order\nto help foster regional confidence and trust, and in spite of\nsensitive regional conditions and the bitter experience of a\nrecent foreign aggression against the Islamic Republic of\nIran, we have allocated a mere 1.5 per cent of the national\nbudget for defence and have had the lowest military\npurchases in the entire region.\nExternally, Iran has formulated its policy with a view\nto encouraging and promoting security and stability in the\nregion, as well as expanding political, economic, cultural and\nscientific cooperation between the countries of the area. The\nposition of principle adopted by Iran in the course of the\nPersian Gulf crisis; our constant effort to prevent the spread\nof violence in the region; our even-handed and consistent\nemphasis on international understanding and compromise in\nAfghanistan and Tajikistan; our attempts to secure a peaceful\nsettlement in the Caucasus; our being host to the highest\nnumber of refugees in the world; and the humanitarian\nassistance extended by Iran to victims of crisis in the region;\nthese are all consistent with our policy of strengthening\nstability, preventing tension and mitigating the human\nsuffering of the crisis victims in the region. We firmly\nbelieve that the pursuit of these efforts, along with\nconsultations and cooperation between concerned States and\ninternational organizations, is required to contain and settle\nthese conflicts and alleviate their ensuing human tragedies.\nTo ensure peace and stability in Central Asia and the\nTranscaucasus, it is necessary to encourage trade with the\ncountries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, create the right\nconditions for economic development in each country,\nreinforce regional commonalities and complementarities, and\nimprove the opportunities for these countries to participate\nmore profitably in world trade. The efforts of the members\nof the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) to achieve\nthese goals and to overcome obstacles to regional\ndevelopment by consolidating mutual cooperation and\nfostering cooperation with other countries and international\norganizations will contribute positively to regional and\ninternational peace and security. Formal collaboration\nbetween ECO and the United Nations, which requires\napproval by the Assembly of ECO\u2019s request for observer\nstatus, will also expedite the realization of these objectives.\nThe vital importance of the Persian Gulf for the\nsecurity and economic development of the Islamic Republic\nof Iran is self-evident. Iran, with the longest coast on the\nPersian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, has historically equated\nits own national security and economic prosperity with\nsecurity, stability, tranquillity and the free flow of oil and\ninternational commerce in the Persian Gulf area. It has\nthereby acted as a force for stability. In this context, we\nhave also proposed the establishment of regional security\nand cooperation arrangements in the Persian Gulf, whose\noutline I presented to the forty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly. The experience of two devastating wars in the\nPersian Gulf region within one decade clearly illustrates the\nfact that baseless territorial claims lead to the erosion of\nunderstanding and confidence, only furthering the interest of\nforeign Powers.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 25\nThe common religious, cultural, historical and\ncommercial heritage of the countries of this region provide\na good and solid foundation on which initiatives to reinforce\nmutual trust and develop multilateral cooperation between\nthese States can be founded. The Islamic Republic of Iran\nhas taken the initiative by manifesting its political will and\nadopting practical measures in order to strengthen political\nties and further develop and consolidate commercial,\neconomic and cultural cooperation with our neighbours in\nthe Persian Gulf. In turn, we would welcome and respond\naccordingly to any positive step from our neighbours.\nLet me conclude by reiterating that recent international\ndevelopments and emerging challenges have placed the\nUnited Nations at a critical and historic crossroads. Success,\nin our view, will depend on a sober understanding of the\ncauses of tension and mistrust during the cold war, followed\nby resolute steps to root them out. Joint effort is also\nneeded to develop and put into motion multidimensional\nconfidence-building measures and techniques, consolidate\nand expand international cooperation, and bring about\nconditions conducive to the attainment of common\naspirations of humanity, particularly justice, security and\nbalanced development. The Islamic Republic of Iran is fully\nprepared to intensify its efforts in cooperation with other\nStates in this Assembly and in other bilateral and multilateral\nenvironments for the attainment of these objectives.\n"

        "file_text": "The General Assembly\u2019s annual convening in New York is\na world event which, each year, expresses the hope of\nnations and peoples to find common ground, through\ndialogue and joint effort, in order to live together their\nshared destiny. In a world that is becoming daily more\ndiverse and in which peoples are witness to so many\ncontradictions, is it not here and now, in close friendship and\nfraternal dialogue, that humanity, with its boundless\nintellectual and ethical potential, can embark on a process of\nself-examination and be reconciled with the universal\nconscience, which is also the foundation of our human\ncalling to live together and in harmony?\nIt is in that belief that the delegation of Senegal - which\nparticipated in your election, Mr. President, aware of your\nbrilliant political record and the outstanding role your\ncountry plays on the international scene - extends to you\nthrough me the warm congratulations of my country, our\npeople and its leaders. We have no doubt about your\nmastery of international practice, for we know that your vast\nexperience as a statesman will make it possible for you to\nconduct, with effectiveness, intelligence and skill the work\nof this session of the General Assembly. My best wishes\nare thus with you in your election and with the task you\nhave been called upon to accomplish, until September 1994,\nfrom this historic and lofty rostrum.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, guided the proceedings of\nthe forty-seventh session of our General Assembly with a\ncompetence and effectiveness that deserve our appreciation\nand gratitude. We wish heartily to congratulate him.\nI should like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the enormous\nenergy that he has expended with such foresight and courage\nto ensure the implementation of the principles and the\nrealization of the objectives of the Charter of our\nOrganization. The personal friendship that I have shared\nwith that eminent citizen of the world for almost 25 years\nallows me to reiterate the esteem and admiration that I have\nalways felt towards him.\nFinally, I should like to extend my country\u2019s\ncongratulations to all the new States Members of our\nOrganization - the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, the\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Principality of\nMonaco, the Principality of Andorra and Eritrea. I welcome\nall of them to the United Nations family.\nSome 15 years ago, in September 1978, I had the\nhonour for the first time, in my capacity as the new Minister\nfor Foreign Affairs of Senegal, to address this Assembly.\nAs the young head of the diplomatic corps of an African\ncountry, I referred to the many problems then confronting\nthe international community and which revolved around two\nbasic focal points.\nThe first of these was the accession to political\nsovereignty of peoples that had not yet experienced freedom,\nthat had been denied the full exercise of inalienable rights\ninherent to every human being on Earth. Those rights had\nbeen denied them by other men, other peoples, other States\nand other nations in the name of a system that was imposed\non them and to which they had been subjected. Hope in\ntheir fellow man was their only defence.\nThe other focal point of attention was the grave\ninequality of conditions for the economic, social, human and\ncultural development of nations. Some of these nations had\nnear-total control of scientific developments, industrial\ntechnology, transport and communications, the cultural media\nand world trade networks. They even controlled the raw\nmaterials that were produced, to a great extent, in the\nunderdeveloped regions.\n\nAt the same time, while the prices of these raw\nmaterials were falling year after year at a dizzying pace,\nother nations were forced to buy at a high price and with\nreduced resources the consumer goods produced in the\nindustrialized countries. Those nations were devoting all of\ntheir export income to these transactions and were therefore\nunable to invest in order to ensure their own development.\nThus doomed to indebtedness, they lost a significant part of\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 9\ntheir own sovereignty just as they were taking their first\ntentative steps onto the international scene.\nAnd here we are today, 15 years later, gathered together\nto evaluate, in an outpouring of solidarity, the distance we\nhave covered.\nThe fact is that the world has changed - yes, it has\nchanged - and the transformations that characterize this end\nof the twentieth century are so profound that the\ninternational community at large feels the need to reform\nradically the way the United Nations functions, as regards,\nparticularly, the composition of the Security Council, the\nfinancial management of the United Nations and cooperation\nfor development, to mention just a few of the most acute\nneeds of the present day.\nThe world has changed. As for the African continent -\nto take this as a point of reference - most of the peoples\nformerly under foreign domination have acceded to\nindependence. States have been created; the structures of an\neconomy have been established; and political and economic\nleaders have been trained and set to work to help these\npeoples fulfil their destinies.\nBut inequalities remain, even though an unprecedented\nglobal crisis today affects the economies of all countries,\nincluding even those of the most highly industrialized\nnations. The world economy seems to have become\ndislocated. It has lost its balance. New rules are established\nand developed day by day in the quest for new balances and\nnew solutions. And all this is done in a situation that\nincreasingly jeopardizes international peace. This situation\ncould, if we are not careful, lead to impatience, to\nintolerance, to irritation, to a lack of dialogue - in short, to\ninevitable confrontation. Such a threat is unacceptable, and\nwe must not accept it.\nThat is why, together with my colleagues the other\nheads of delegations, I would like on behalf of my country -\nan African country, a Sahelian country, a developing country\n- to join other delegations in repeating to the nations\ngathered here that, in spite of all these problems, we do not\nhave the right to despair.\nFor it is obvious today that the salvation of humankind\nresides in solidarity and in friendship and cooperation\nbetween human beings. The fundamental and logical\nunderpinnings of relations between peoples are, more than\never before, dialogue and agreement, expressed through firm\nlanguage that translates our thoughts about the human being\nand about life.\nIt is fortunate that a country such as France - which I\nam pleased to mention, together with other industrialized\ncountries that are supporting Africa - reaffirmed just a few\ndays ago in Paris, through Mr. Alain Jupp\u00e9, Minister for\nForeign Affairs, that the West in general and the European\ncountries in particular must be aware that if the majority of\nthe populations of the world remain hungry, poor, bearing\nthe weight of the distortions in the international economy,\nand if, in addition, they see their efforts to achieve political\nand social democracy destroyed by difficulties of all types,\nthen there will always be a risk that international peace will\nbe destabilized.\nThe industrialized countries must move in the right\ndirection. They must understand that international solidarity\ncan be expressed only through the mutual support that\nnations must give each other. In this respect, our continent,\nAfrica, and many Asian countries should receive this support\nin a context of mutual respect. In other words, the proposal\nfor an \\\"agenda for development\\\" initiated by the Brazilian\ndelegation, with the support of the Group of 77, to\naccompany the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" submitted by our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, deserves the\ninternational community\u2019s attention. This important measure\nreflects the concerns of the Head of State of Senegal,\nPresident Abdou Diouf, who, when he addressed this\nAssembly last year, on this very date, launched the idea of\na general agreement on solidarity as the foundation for\nfruitful international economic cooperation, the driving force\nof North-South solidarity in a renewed form.\nAncient African wisdom - the ancient wisdom of our\ncontinent -teaches us that human beings, who alone can\nchange and improve their own environment, are endowed\nwith prodigious intellectual and moral resources, resources\nbased on intelligence, imagination and the ability to rise to\na situation in a way that makes it possible for them to fulfil\ntheir destiny. We must remain united and mutually\nsupportive.\nIn this connection, the delegation of Senegal solemnly\ncommends the international community for the efforts that\nmade possible the signing in Washington on\n13 September 1993 of the agreement between the State of\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization. This\nhistoric event put an end to many decades of hostility and\nrancour, which cost thousands of lives and left many\nwounded and many alone, orphaned or widowed - all\nbecause of a lack of understanding which itself led to the\ndestruction of the conditions for development in the Middle\nEastern countries as a whole. And, what is more, there was\nthe flare-up in oil prices which began in October 1973 and\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwhich led to the inflationary curves that have since then\ncharacterized the global economy everywhere in the world.\nIt is now up to the international community to work to\nconsolidate this important step in the direction of a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. In this endeavour,\nthe United Nations family can rely, as in the past, on the\nconstant and active support of my country to ensure that in\nthat holy land Israelis and Palestinians can bring humankind\ninto harmony with its profound values of tolerance, wisdom\nand concord.\nThat is also the way we view the efforts made to\nresolve conflicts that in the past seemed beyond any human\nsolution. I have in mind, inter alia, Cambodia, where the\nsettlement plan designed by the United Nations led to the\nholding in May 1993 of general, orderly and democratic\nelections, as a result of which a legitimate Government was\nestablished; El Salvador, where, after several years of civil\nwar, negotiations conducted under the auspices of the United\nNations led to the signing, at the beginning of last year, of\nthe Mexico Agreement, which initiated a period of transition\ntowards general elections planned for the beginning of 1994;\nLiberia, where repeated initiatives pursued by the members\nof the Economic Community of West African States,\nsupported by the United Nations and by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, made it possible to conclude, in July 1993, a\nnew peace agreement which should, as we fervently hope,\nlead to a definitive settlement of that fratricidal conflict; and\nMozambique and Rwanda, where similar agreements have\nbeen concluded and where the United Nations has been\nmeaningfully involved in their practical and complete\nimplementation.\nI also have in mind South Africa, where considerable\nprogress has been made toward eliminating a system which\nthe entire world rejected and condemned, and where peoples,\nunited in fruitful diversity, must work together for the\nemergence of a human community characterized by justice\nand equality. My country, Senegal, will respond to the\nappeal made in this Hall a few days ago by President Nelson\nMandela, when, from this very rostrum, he invited the\ninternational community to take a new approach consistent\nwith the evolution of the situation in his country.\nAll of these are excellent examples of the fact that\nthese new times bear new hopes, even though we still have\ngrounds for legitimate concern. In fact, despite the victories\nthat freedom has won, when peoples are liberated peace is\nnot always the result. The legacy of the collapsing old order\nis in fact often an unwieldy one, difficult to manage. On the\nruins of oppression which lasted for far too long we must\nbuild a new world, a world of freedom and peace, of justice\nand progress.\nDuring this uncertain period of transition, border\nconflicts, problems between neighbours and religious\ntensions bring a return to the conflicts - civil war, genocide,\nrivalry among members of the same national community - of\nan era we thought past. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Angola:\nthere are many examples that show that universal peace, that\nprimary objective of the United Nations, is yet but an\naspiration.\nThe challenge, therefore, is to do all in our power so\nthat in all parts of the world the freedoms regained will open\nthe way to peace. My country, Senegal, which has always\nand in every way been committed to strengthening peace and\npromoting security, feels that working towards this objective\nmeans, first and foremost, affirming forcefully the rule of\nlaw in international relations. Lasting peace and security, in\nfact, can be guaranteed only if all nations of the world\ncomply with the rule of law in their relations with other\nnations. That law must be the same for all if justice is to\nprevail.\nIn this context, and in connection with the tragedy of\nthe fraternal people of Kuwait, I welcome the happy\nconclusions that have been reached by the Iraq-Kuwait\nBoundary Demarcation Commission. The international\ncommunity must continue to protect all States from any\nexternal threat to their independence and sovereignty.\nMy thoughts turn also to Bosnia and Herzegovina, a\nmartyred State and a State Member of the United Nations.\nI believe the international community has endeavoured in\nevery stage of the evolution of the situation in the former\nYugoslavia to guarantee the territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the international\ncommunity has committed itself to enforcing, above all, the\nrights of the Bosnian people, a people today undeniably the\nvictim of true genocide. This commitment must be\nrespected because the very credibility of our Organization is\nat stake.\nIn any event, it is in order to uphold respect for that\ncommitment that my country, whose Head of State is\nChairman of the Sixth Islamic Summit Conference, intends\nto continue the efforts he has already begun to contribute to\nthe promotion of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in close\ncooperation with all countries that cherish the same ideals of\npeace and justice.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 11\nI also have in mind the painful situation prevailing in\nAngola. The Bicesse Accords, although freely entered into\nby the parties to the conflict, seem today to have collapsed.\nBy calling into question the validity of the elections\norganized a year ago under those same Bicesse Accords,\nUNITA has once again plunged Angola into an atmosphere\nfraught with danger and uncertainty. The magnitude of the\ndestruction and suffering caused by this situation warrants\nurgent efforts to arrive at a definitive cease-fire and a\nresumption of negotiations. The framework already exists:\nthe Bicesse Accords, endorsed by the United Nations. The\nprinciples on which any solution to the conflict must be\nbased are also very clear: the safeguarding of Angola\u2019s\nterritorial integrity and national unity and also, above all,\nrespect for the will of the Angolan people, freely expressed\nin the elections a year ago.\nOn these bases, my country would here like to send out\na solemn appeal to all our Angolan brothers and sisters,\nabove all those of UNITA, to understand that it is not in the\ninterests of the Angolan people to continue the fighting. The\ninterests of the Angolan people reside exclusively in the\nnational effort that all must make to restore peace and\nharmony to Angola. We Senegalese, for our part, support all\nefforts to help them in this regard.\nThere is also the situation in Somalia, where a great\ndeal remains to be done to restore peace and organize a\nviable State. The United Nations there is on the right path,\nconducting the most ambitious and largest operation ever\norganized in Africa. My country would like to express its\npleasure once again over the organization of this operation\nin a country that is today experiencing a tragic and complex\nsituation. The infrastructure has been devastated, the State\nhas collapsed and fratricidal internal strife has engendered\nmassive displacements of the population.\nIn the face of this tragic situation and in support of the\nAddis Ababa Agreement, which was the result on last 28\nMarch of the Conference on National Reconciliation in\nSomalia, the international community, through the United\nNations, gave the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM II) a mandate to continue the disarmament and\nto work towards national reconciliation, and at the same\ntime, and most important, towards the strengthening of\npolitical institutions.\nWe are pleased to note that today, in spite of the\nsporadic turmoil of recent months, UNOSOM II has begun\nto help the Somali people restore the sovereignty and\nintegrity of the State. It is in Somalia\u2019s and the whole\ninternational community\u2019s interests for this mission to\ncontinue and that it achieve the desired results.\nI wish at this point to conclude my statement on a\nhopeful note.\nThere is a clear awareness today that our planetary\ncommunity is inextricably interrelated, that it rests on a\nnatural unity based on scientific and medical discoveries and\nthe speed of communications. But despite, and perhaps\nbecause of, this very progress there remains a certain\nfragility in the balance of our world.\nOur calling as human beings endowed with reason is\ntherefore to remain united and to ensure together, hand in\nhand, the survival of humankind. It is our duty to see to it\nthat our populations live long and in good health, to see to\nit that future generations derive the greatest benefit from the\nexperiences we have had and that we are having now, so\nthat, tomorrow, our legacy to them will be a world that has\nnot been destroyed, a generous nature, a land united on the\nsolid foundations of friendship, brotherhood, love and peace.\n"

It furthermore attests to the\ninternational community\u2019s confidence in your ability to carry\nout the duties of President of the General Assembly during\nthe next 12 months. I have no doubt that, given your\nsterling qualities, you will guide this session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI also wish to commend your distinguished predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of\nBulgaria, for the able and outstanding manner in which he\nconducted the affairs of the forty-seventh session.\nI would also like to express my delegation\u2019s\nacknowledgement of the dedicated manner in which the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has been\ndirecting the work of our Organization during this crucial\nperiod.\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria,\nI welcome all the new Member States, fully confident of the\nuseful contribution they can make in furtherance of the noble\nobjectives of the United Nations.\nThe relevance of our great Organization to the solution\nof the common problems facing humanity is more manifest\ntoday than at any time in our history. The complexity of\nthese pressing concerns and the need to act rapidly and with\nresolve demand a greater degree of concerted efforts by\nmembers of the international community. Events happening\naround us demonstrate the urgency of this imperative. In the\nlast few years, the international landscape has witnessed\nunprecedented transformations and rapid changes. The cold\nwar has become a thing of the past. Progress has been made\nin nuclear disarmament. The wave of democratization which\nhas been sweeping across the world has not diminished in\nintensity or breadth. The search for greater prosperity\nthrough emerging regional economic arrangements is\nspreading.\nIn spite of the inherent benefits of all these\ndevelopments, no sooner do we succeed in resolving one set\nof problems than we are confronted with new and more\nchallenging ones. Indeed, the promise of global peace and\n\nsecurity and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by\npolitical and ethnic conflicts, economic and social disorder,\nand deepening poverty, particularly in developing countries.\nIn this connection, the consequences of feeble gestures\nor inaction are just too frightening to contemplate. It is\ntherefore necessary to draw attention to the major concerns\nso that they can be fully addressed with a view to finding\nlasting solutions which are just and beneficial to every\nmember of the international community.\nIn view of the positive changes in the international\npolitical environment, the United Nations has been placed at\nthe centre of conflict resolution, having been accorded its\nrightful place in the promotion and maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Unfortunately, our\nOrganization is being overwhelmed by the avalanche of\nconflicts which it is suddenly called upon to resolve.\nPractically all regions of the world are embroiled in one\nconflict or another. No region, however, is as afflicted as\nAfrica, either in the number of conflicts currently raging or\nin their unimaginable negative effects on people. In one\nconflict alone - that of Angola - as many as 1,000 people are\nreported to be dying each day. Angola is not alone in the\nunenviable situation created by civil conflict: Sudan,\nSomalia and Liberia can be cited.\nRegional conflicts constitute a key threat to the\nachievement of global peace and security. This is why we\nwelcome the active and increased involvement of the United\nNations in peace-keeping and peace-building efforts. The\nrole of our Organization in these areas will continue to\nexpand as more States call on it for assistance in preventing\nor containing conflicts. Member States have the duty to\nsupport fully the work of the Organization in this very\nimportant role. They must be prepared to provide the\nOrganization with the resources and the personnel it requires\nto cope with ever-growing peace-keeping demands. The\nprice of peace may be high; we must be conscious, however,\nthat it is a far better bargain compared with the price of war.\nIn this connection, the recent mammoth and multifaceted\npeace-keeping operation in Cambodia gives cause for great\noptimism.\nThe United Nations must direct its peace-keeping\noperations in a manner that does not jeopardize its integrity\nor expose its peace-keepers to avoidable danger.\nFurthermore, it must be made clear to those who commit\nacts of aggression against United Nations peace-keepers that\nthey will be adjudged guilty of crimes against the\ninternational community. The safety of United Nations\npeace-keepers is of utmost concern to countries which, like\nNigeria, participate in many operations within and outside\nAfrica.\nI recall that, while on peace-keeping duty in the former\nYugoslavia, Nigerian troops were subjected to attack\nresulting in casualties. The same is happening in Somalia,\nwhere Pakistani, Italian, Nigerian, American and Malaysian\npeace-keepers have been brutally killed. The national\ntrauma occasioned by the loss of lives in United Nations\npeace-keeping missions gives rise to anxieties and doubts.\nHowever, I wish to assure this body that Nigeria will\ncontinue to demonstrate its commitment to the United\nNations by continued participation in its peace-keeping\noperations.\nIt is in this same spirit of service that Nigeria is seeking\nelection to the Security Council this year. I hope that\nMember States will give their valuable support to Nigeria\u2019s\ncandidature.\nIn Africa, we have also made great efforts to contain\nand resolve conflicts in our continent. Nigeria has been\ninvolved in many of these efforts to bring peace to embattled\nareas. At the bilateral level, we hosted peace conferences of\nthe parties to the conflict in the Sudan. We have, through\nthe Organization of African Unity, joined other African\nStates to monitor the cease-fire in Rwanda. In Liberia,\nNigeria has been the moving force in the regional effort to\nbring peace to that war-torn country through the Military\nObserver Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic Community\nof West African States.\nBecause of positive developments in Liberia, we have\nindicated our intention to withdraw our troops at the\nappropriate time. This decision was based on the successful\nconclusion and acceptance of the Cotonou Agreement. All\nthe parties to the conflict and the international community\naccept the Cotonou Agreement as the basis for durable peace\nin Liberia. If, as we hope, the accord is faithfully\nimplemented, a democratically elected Government will have\nbeen installed in Liberia within the time-frame envisaged for\nthe withdrawal of our troops. While we do not, therefore,\ncontemplate a premature withdrawal, through this forum I\ncall upon the international community to bear in mind that\nNigeria has expended and continues to expend a significant\namount in the peace-keeping operation in Liberia. Urgent\ninternational support to the ECOMOG effort has become\ncrucial. Nigeria therefore welcomes Security Council\nresolution 866 (1993) of 21 September 1993, which set up\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)\nand called upon Member States to support the peace process\nin Liberia by contributing to the Trust Fund being\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 3\nestablished by the Secretary-General. Early implementation\nwill be absolutely necessary to sustain the process.\nA cheering development in our continent is taking place\nin South Africa, where a democratic Government is now\nwithin sight. The doyen of South African nationalists,\nNelson Mandela, confirmed the irreversibility of the march\ntowards an apartheid-free society in his statement in this\nHall two weeks ago. As evidence of his conviction, he\ncalled for the lifting of the remaining economic sanctions on\nSouth Africa. I wish, in the name of Nigeria, to congratulate\nSouth African leaders, black and white, who in the past two\nyears have shown great statesmanship in the negotiations that\nhave resulted in the establishment by law of the Transitional\nExecutive Council.\nSouth Africa has come a long way out of its apartheid-\ninduced isolation. The international community should assist\nthe South Africans in completing the process of full\nintegration into the international system. To this end, those\nresponsible for the mindless violence occurring daily should\nbe unreservedly condemned. All South Africans should\nrealize that the watchful eyes of the international community\ncontinue to be focused on their country.\nNigeria will take immediate steps to respond to\nNelson Mandela\u2019s call for economic cooperation with South\nAfrica. We shall also commence such contacts with the\nTransitional Executive Council, when it is physically\nestablished, as will facilitate diplomatic interaction at the\nappropriate time.\nThe road to democracy and the nurturing of democratic\ninstitutions in Africa have not been smooth. Indeed, the\ndemocratic enterprise in Africa faces many problems.\nAfrica\u2019s economic underdevelopment and high level of\nilliteracy constitute major impediments to our attainment of\ndemocracy in its modern concept.\nBut such has been our fascination with democracy as a\nvalue deeply rooted in our culture that we in Africa have\nwillingly decided to face up to the challenge of putting in\nplace an enduring system of democratic governance in our\nrespective countries. I can say confidently that this is an\nenterprise my country has taken seriously. Our programme\nof transition from military to civilian rule has not been\nwithout its difficult moments. However, we have not\nallowed them to deter us from our cherished goal. We are\ndetermined not to repeat the mistakes of our earlier attempts\nto evolve a system that would preserve the corporate unity\nof our country. It was, therefore, to ensure that the\ndemocratic process could be completed within the shortest\npossible period - indeed, by March 1994 - that the Interim\nNational Government, which I have the honour and privilege\nto lead, was seen as the most viable option to ease the\nmilitary out of power without bloodshed.\nWe in Nigeria fully understand and appreciate the\ninterest and concern shown by the international community\nregarding recent political events in our country. After all,\ndemocratization has become a major component of the\nemerging new world order. We therefore appeal for the\nunderstanding of the international community in this difficult\nperiod in our nation\u2019s history. I can assure this Assembly\nthat we are working very hard to find a just and generally\nacceptable solution to our problem. In this connection, I am\nhappy to state that only yesterday I inaugurated a\nhigh-powered Commission of Eminent Persons to look into\nthe circumstances leading to the annulment of the 12 June\npresidential election and submit a report within 60 days.\nNigeria has always respected the purposes and\nprinciples contained in the United Nations Charter and the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Aware that the\nhuman person is the central subject and main beneficiary of\nhuman rights, we fully believe that every citizen should\nparticipate actively, within legal limits, in the realization of\nthese rights. We welcome the Vienna Declaration on human\nrights and will, therefore, continue to be committed to the\nfreedom of all citizens and institutions that are engaged in\nhuman-rights activities.\nOne of the sad consequences of human-rights violations\nis the incidence of refugees and displaced persons - people\nfleeing from insecurity to safe havens, either within or\noutside their national territories. Today, several countries,\nincluding Nigeria, cater for the needs of millions of refugees.\nWe urge the countries of origin of these people to create an\nenvironment conducive to their return. This would help to\nreduce the severity of the impact of refugee flows on host\nnations, particularly in Africa, which are themselves faced\nwith excruciating economic difficulties.\nNigeria notes with great satisfaction that the situation in\nthe Middle East has taken a definite turn for the better. The\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nhistoric signing of the peace agreement by Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a welcome and\nimportant landmark. We are convinced that this will lay the\nfoundation for peace between Israel and the Palestinians and\nwill constitute an indispensable element for the peaceful\nresolution of the entire Middle East problem. We again\ncongratulate the Government of Israel and the leadership of\nthe PLO, whose spirit of conciliation made the agreement a\nreality. We also commend the Governments of Norway, the\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation for\ntheir efforts and their encouragement and support, which\nmade the peace agreement possible.\nThe debt crisis remains the most serious obstacle to our\neconomic development. The various attempts of creditor\ncountries to address this problem have been limited in scope\nand have failed adequately to deal with the debt problem of\nmiddle-income countries. Therefore, while noting with\nappreciation the relief provided under the Trinidad, Toronto\nand Houston terms, we must emphasize that the fundamental\ncrisis in the economic development of developing countries\nhas not been effectively addressed. The fact that the debt of\nAfrican countries in 1992 amounted to $275 billion - about\n73 per cent of the total output of the African continent -\ndemonstrates clearly the seriousness of the situation.\nMoreover, when it is borne in mind that debt-servicing\nobligations are estimated at about 30 per cent of the value of\nour exports, the crippling effect on our economies becomes\napparent. We therefore propose a dialogue involving all the\nparties to enable the issues to be properly addressed.\nThe various dimensions of Africa\u2019s economic problems\nare worth repeating, as we who are at the receiving end of\nthe economic dislocation of varying degrees that affects most\nAfrican countries realize the necessity of continuing to draw\nour economic plight to the attention of the rest of the world.\nThis matter must not be regarded lightly. The African\neconomic crisis, as well as being a major source of the\nprevailing social and political turmoil in many countries of\nthe region, must be seen as a serious threat to the longer-\nterm prospects for the global economy.\nLet me be so bold as to say that the persistence of the\ncrisis is not due to inaction on the part of the African\nGovernments concerned. On the contrary - taking the\nexample of my country - the truth is that our determination\nto face up to the challenge of development is obvious from\nthe policy reforms we have been implementing for nearly\nseven years in order to restructure and revitalize the\neconomy. These reforms are already yielding some positive\nresults, but not of the magnitude that we regard as necessary\nif there is to be a significant upturn in the economy.\nIt would not be far-fetched to suggest that the fact that\nthe economic reforms that have been put in place have\nenjoyed only limited success is apparently due to lack of\nadequate support from the international community to\ncomplement our genuine efforts to revamp our respective\neconomies. For instance, the flow of external finance to\nAfrican countries still leaves much to be desired, despite the\nefforts made in recent years by countries like mine to ensure\na climate conducive to foreign investment. We therefore\nurge a change of heart on the part of our development\npartners, as this will be mutually beneficial. We also call on\nthe United Nations system to mobilize its machinery fully so\nthat lingering African economic problems may be addressed\neffectively.\nToday, Africa faces daunting environmental problems\ntoo. Desertification, drought, soil and marine erosion and\nshortage of fresh water are new difficulties confronting the\ncontinent. Two fifths of Africa\u2019s land mass has turned into\ndesert. African countries continue to make efforts to arrest\nthis threat to our livelihood. However, we do not have\nsufficient resources to combat the scourge. We therefore\nurge the speedy conclusion of an international convention,\ncomplete with a funding mechanism, to combat drought and\ndesertification.\nIn the aftermath of the cold war, appreciable progress\nhas been made in the field of disarmament. It is comforting\nto note that, to a greater extent than during any other period\nin recent history, significant efforts have been made by\nStates to achieve openness and transparency with regard to\nsecurity issues. The unilateral decision of the nuclear-\nweapon States to halt nuclear testing was universally\napplauded. Needless to say, therefore, we were disappointed\nat the breach of the moratorium that occurred a few days\nago. We appeal once again to all nuclear-weapon States to\nrefrain from resuming nuclear testing and, thereby, enhance\nthe prospects for the non-proliferation Treaty review and\nextension Conference in 1995, which will be crucial to\nefforts to halt nuclear proliferation.\nSince the creation of the United Nations 48 years ago,\nthe world in which the Organization exists has undergone\nmany changes. These changes are reflected in its\nmembership, which, since 1945, has almost quadrupled. The\ndistribution of power and influence in the world has\nchanged. The institutions of the United Nations cannot and\nshould not be immune to the changes. Indeed, in order to\nmaintain its relevance, the United Nations must reflect the\nchanges in its environment. We renew our call for a serious\nreview of some of the institutions of the Organization -\nparticularly the Security Council. We have always stressed\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5\nthe need to expand the membership of the Council by the\nadmission of additional permanent members so that all\nregions of the world would be represented. It is our hope\nthat negotiations on this crucial issue will be advanced\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\nNotwithstanding the several positive developments of\nthe past few years, the world still faces many challenges. In\naddition to the continued disruption of the peace and stability\nof many States by raging internal conflicts, there are\nproblems that require urgent action. The spread of poverty\nand the increasing imbalance between the developing and the\ndeveloped countries are two of the more spectacular of these\nproblems. We are convinced that correction of this\nunacceptable situation is an attainable objective.\nHowever, the solution requires a commitment by all\nStates to accept and vigorously practise the concept of\ninternational cooperation. My country remains an active\npartner in this cooperative endeavour to make our world\nsafer and more prosperous.\nAs we look forward to the celebration, in two years\u2019\ntime, of the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United\nNations, there is in the air much optimism about the future\nof the Organization. The new world order, if it is to fulfil\nits promise, must be constructed on the solid foundation of\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Thus,\nour Organization is bound to play a central role in sustaining\na world of the sovereign equality of States; a world of\nrespect for fundamental human rights; a world of global\ninterdependence and of cooperation for development.\nLet all Member States demonstrate the determination to\nensure that our world body justifies the expectations of\nhumanity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica, I am\nhonoured to congratulate you, Sir, and your country, the\nCooperative Republic of Guyana, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nI am particularly pleased that this position is held this year,\nfor the first time, by a national of a country that is a\nmember of the Caribbean Community and I have no doubt\nthat your intellect and wide experience as one of the\nCaribbean\u2019s most outstanding diplomats will ensure\nexcellence in the performance of your duties. I assure you\nof the full cooperation of the delegation of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica in the conduct of the affairs of\nthis General Assembly.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate\nAndorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco and the Slovak Republic on\ntheir admission to membership of the United Nations. The\ninternational community is, in the words of Secretary-\nGeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali:\n\\\"Humanity\u2019s best hope in the pursuit of peace,\ndevelopment and human rights\\\". (A/48/1, para. 513)\nWe therefore welcome these new Members as they join in\nthe commitment to world peace, development and support\nfor democracy and human rights.\nThe universality of membership is an important\nprinciple of the United Nations. We believe that, in keeping\nwith this principle and in accordance with the established\npattern of parallel representation of divided countries in the\nUnited Nations, the exceptional case of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan should be seriously considered by the\ninternational community at the next session of the General\nAssembly. The Republic of China on Taiwan, with its rich\nnatural and human resources could, if given the opportunity,\nmake a significant contribution to the international\ncommunity. Its people are also entitled to enjoy the rights\nenjoyed by all populations of the Members of this world\nbody. The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore supports\nthe efforts of the Republic of China on Taiwan to obtain full\nmembership of the United Nations after being unable to\nparticipate for 22 years.\nPermit me to congratulate Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali on his ongoing reform efforts aimed\nat streamlining the operations of the United Nations. The\nstate of the Organization\u2019s finances is an issue which should\nbe of concern to all its Members. In that regard the\nCommonwealth of Dominica is making every effort to\nhonour its financial commitments to the Organization.\nAs the international community takes on greater\nresponsibilities in its efforts to establish a more stable world\norder, restructuring the Organization with improved cost\neffectiveness is becoming ever more critical. The\nOrganization must do its utmost to avoid wasting limited\nresources. However, the effect of cost-cutting on the\ninterests of small developing countries needs to be examined\nclosely. While the United Nations becomes more active in\npeace-keeping in various parts of the world, programmes\naimed at assisting developing countries must not be allowed\nto suffer. We firmly believe that the right to development\nis an inalienable right, a right of every human person and of\nall peoples.\nDominica\u2019s economy is entirely dependent, at the\npresent time, on the banana industry and on favoured access\nto our traditional markets in Europe. Our industry, vital to\nthe survival of the Dominican people, is being threatened by\nthe major banana producers of Latin America, although the\nWindward Islands industry accounts for only 2 per cent of\nthe world\u2019s production of bananas. A threat to the banana\nindustry in Dominica is also a threat to the fundamental\nhuman rights of its people as the collapse of this industry\ncould lead to economic collapse, social upheaval and\npolitical disaster. The same prospect looms over the other\nWindward Islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada,\nwith consequential effects on the other States of the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). Indeed,\njust last week we heard of serious unrest in St. Lucia as a\ndirect consequence of adverse trends in banana prices. This\nis an augury of what could happen in any or all of the\nWindward Islands.\nWe call on the international community to support\nDominica in its efforts to ensure the survival of its economy\nand the protection of its peoples\u2019 political, civil, economic,\nsocial and cultural rights. More particularly, I call on our\nLatin American neighbours to honour the spirit of the\nDeclaration of Managua and to take into account the\nseverely adverse impact on the economies of OECS States\nthat their policies on bananas, not critical to their own\neconomies, are likely to have on ours.\nDemocracy and human rights have been a priority of\nthe world community since the inception of the United\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 15\nNations. Over the years there has been much debate on the\nuniversality of human rights and its indivisibility from, and\nlink to, development. The decision of the General\nAssembly, by its resolution 45/155, to convene the Vienna\nConference to deal with crucial issues surrounding the\npromotion and protection of human rights was timely and\nsignificant. Dominica applauds the efforts of those who\nworked towards the success of this important and historic\nConference. I am particularly proud of Dominica\u2019s\nparticipation in the preparatory process as well as in the\nWorld Conference, which is an indication of our full\ncommitment to the universalization of respect for human\nrights and the preservation of democracy.\nRepresentatives at the World Conference gave a clear\nsignal that it is necessary to increase financial and other\nresources to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights\nand the regional Commissions in order to reinforce their\nability to provide greater technical cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional and national human rights\ninstitutions. As the focal point for human rights activities of\nthe United Nations and the primary organizational institution\nwithin the Secretariat for the implementation of the human\nrights programme, the Centre for Human Rights must be\nprovided with adequate means for carrying out its mandate.\nOn the international scene, the breakthroughs made in\nthe Middle East and South Africa must be celebrated.\nRecent decisions taken by the leaders of those countries are\nencouraging and augur well for the future. The Madrid\npeace process launched in 1991 has not been in vain.\nDominica noted with great satisfaction and pleasure the\nsigning of the peace agreement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization - an agreement which will\nserve to secure a firm foundation for the mutual recognition\nof the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. We sincerely hope\nthat this agreement will eventually bring an end to the\npersistent violence and conflict that have plagued the Middle\nEast for over four decades.\nOne year ago in this body, Dominica called for\nconstructive and open dialogue between the African National\nCongress and the Pretoria regime in an effort to arrive at an\nearly agreement on majority rule in South Africa. President\nDe Klerk and Nelson Mandela\u2019s recent actions are a clear\nindication of their interest in peaceful progress towards a\ntruly just and democratic society in the affairs of that\ncountry.\nThe finalization of the demarcation of the boundary\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq is a step towards the enhancement\nof stability and security in that region. We welcome the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 833 (1993), in which\nthe inviolability of this boundary is guaranteed, and we call\nupon Iraq to respect the terms of the resolution.\nIt is indeed disheartening that while progress is being\nmade in the protection of human rights in certain parts of the\nworld, the rights of the people of our Caribbean sister island,\nHaiti, continue to be violated even after moves by members\nof the international community to suspend sanctions against\nHaiti. Dominica, acting on Security Council resolution\n861 (1993), ordered the immediate suspension of all\nsanctions against Haiti, following the confirmation of Robert\nMalval as Prime Minister.\nThe Governors Island Agreement of July 1993 offered\na glimmer of hope for the restoration of democracy and\nconstitutional order in that country and for the eventual\nreturn of President Aristide to power. These hopes were\nshattered by the actions of those who officially sanction\nviolence, threatening the lives of constitutionally appointed\nofficials. The members of the de facto regime must\nunderstand that the international community will not stand\nidly by if the terms of the Governors Island Agreement are\nnot respected. If the parties in Haiti fail to comply in good\nfaith with this Agreement, Dominica will be ready to\nreactivate sanctions in keeping with the United Nations\nresolution to that effect. We will also do whatever we can\nwithin our limited resources to contribute to the restoration\nof democracy in Haiti. In that regard, Dominica is willing\nto contribute to the civilian police and training contingent to\nHaiti to assist in the return of President Aristide to the full\nexercise of his constitutional office and the stabilization of\nHaiti. In the meantime, we support President Aristide\u2019s call\nfor the immediate replacement of the Chief of Police, a\nprecondition to the security of the officials of the legitimate\nregime in that country.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in\nSomalia continues to be cause for concern to all those who\nsupport the promotion and protection of human rights. We\ndeplore the human tragedy resulting from ethnic differences\nand more specifically the barbaric torture and killing of\nhundreds of innocent people. We also condemn recent\nevents in Nigeria, which demonstrate a lack of respect for\nthe wishes of the people and a violation of their rights to\nparticipate in the affairs of their country.\nWhile we are focusing on the subject of human rights,\nit is fitting that we make reference to the International Year\nof the World\u2019s Indigenous People launched on 10 December\n1992. The rights of indigenous people all over the world\ncontinue to be violated as they fight to preserve their culture\nand identity. This is of particular concern to us in Dominica\nas our country is one of the few countries with an\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nindigenous Carib population, a courageous and hard-working\npeople with a rich history and culture. I urge the\ninternational community to lend its support to programmes\nand activities designed to allow for the participation of our\nindigenous peoples and other minorities in every aspect of\nthe life of our countries. We in the Caribbean should have\na special interest in this matter when we recall that within 28\nyears of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in our part of\nthe world, the entire indigenous population of the Bahamas\nhad been wiped out by the European conquerors. The\nfailure of the industrialized nations to contribute significantly\nto the special fund is a matter of deep regret, which can yet\nbe reversed.\nDominica has played a vital role in the regional and\ninternational effort to include women fully in the\ndevelopment process and it hopes to participate in the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women to be held in Beijing in 1995.\nWe are particularly concerned about the needs and situations\nof our indigenous women and the necessity for special\nprogrammes to address these needs. I wish to express\nsatisfaction at the establishment of a regional office of the\nUnited Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)\nin the Caribbean and look forward to its support and\ncooperation in all aspects of women\u2019s affairs.\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 46/91, 46/94 and 45/106\ncalled for a set of global targets on ageing for the year 2001\nto provide a pragmatic focus for the broad goals of the\nInternational Plan of Action and to accelerate implementation\nof the Plan. In accordance with the aforementioned\nresolutions, a National Committee on Ageing was established\nin Dominica. The Committee is responsible for developing\na national plan of action and making inputs into a regional\nplan of action on ageing. We call on the international\ncommunity to support programmes tailored to the needs of\nsenior citizens in keeping with national policies.\nThe sustainability of life on our planet is dependent on\nthe importance we place on conservation of the environment.\nDominica reaffirms its political commitment made at the\nEarth Summit held last year to pursue sustainable\ndevelopment.\nWe have recently acceded to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the Vienna\nConvention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, and the\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\nLayer and its amendment, conventions which play a key role\nin the protection of our environment. Sustaining the\nenvironment is compatible with economic growth and\ndevelopment and is essential to sustainable development.\nHowever, it demands considerable additional resources\nwhich developing countries such as Dominica do not\npossess. We realize that we have an obligation to contribute\nto global solutions but additional finances are needed to\nassist in the many actions we will have to undertake to\nconserve the environment and follow sustainable\ndevelopmental practices. We call on the international\ncommunity to strengthen and give fuller support to\ninstitutions such as the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) which are concerned with assisting\ndeveloping countries to achieve sustainable development.\nWe also call on the industrialized countries to offer greater\nassistance to developing countries in the latter\u2019s efforts to\nmake the transition to environmentally friendly technologies\nand economic activity. The industrialized countries of the\nworld, which have disproportionately contributed to the\nenvironmental devastation that has occurred over the past\n200 years, must take seriously their responsibility to\ncontribute to the Global Environment Facility. The ability\nof developing countries to contribute to environmental\nsustainability depends on this.\nDominica welcomes the decision of the United Nations\nto organize the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States in Barbados\nin 1994. We intend to participate fully in this laudable\neffort.\nThe United Nations now offers hope for a future of\npeace, security and development. Let us not allow our\nlegitimate emphasis on peacemaking and peace-keeping to\ndivert our attention from the equally legitimate demands of\nthe developing world for development and security.\nThe delegation of Dominica salutes you, Mr. President,\nand wishes you a very successful presidency of this session\nof the General Assembly.\n"

Your personal qualities, long\nexperience, sagacity and tact make you eminently qualified\nto conduct the deliberations of this session with excellence\nand effectiveness. Just as your election attests to your high\nstanding at the international level, it bespeaks the esteem in\nwhich your country is held by other countries the world\nover. We wish you every success in the important tasks\nassigned to you and trust this session will achieve its\nimportant goals so as to strengthen the functioning of the\nUnited Nations and its organs and enhance their\neffectiveness.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to express our\nthanks and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Ganev of\nBulgaria, for the important role he played in guiding the\nwork and deliberations of the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI cannot fail to extend my best wishes to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts\naimed at strengthening the work of our great Organization,\nupholding the principles and achieving the goals of its\nCharter. We should also like to express our appreciation for\nhis annual report (A/48/1) on the work of the United\nNations, in which he deals with the most important items on\nthe agenda of this session.\nWe should also like to avail ourselves of this\nopportunity to welcome those States that have recently\njoined the United Nations and wish them every success.\nTheir presence here among us attests to the international and\nuniversal nature of the Organization and contributes to the\nattainment of our common goals, in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of the Charter.\nThis is the fourth session in which the Republic of\nYemen is represented by one delegation, whereas in the past\nit was represented by two. On 22 May 1990, our country\nregained its unity after about two centuries of disunity in the\ncourse of which a power struggle raged between the\noccupiers of various parts of the country. This reached its\npeak on 30 November 1967, when Yemen was divided into\ntwo States.\nAlthough that miraculous unitary achievement of four\nyears ago seemed impossible, our people and its wise leaders\nwere able to bring it about, and other peoples that are still\ndivided may look upon our example with hope. Our people\nfought and made many sacrifices over many generations for\nthe attainment of that objective. The unity of our homeland\nhas been characterized by pluralism, multilateralism and\ndemocracy.\nFurthermore, on 27 April of this year the Republic of\nYemen crowned its march towards democracy with general\nparliamentary elections that were free, impartial and honest.\nRepresentatives of international organizations that defend\ndemocratic ideals participated by following those elections\nclosely and monitoring their proper procedure. Western and\nArab monitors welcomed that democratic exercise in Yemen,\nand The New York Times described the events in our country\nas \\\"a true Arab revolution\\\". In the light of all this, we\nbelieve we are justified in feeling a sense of pride as we\ntake part in this session against the backdrop of such\nachievement by a country that has worked two miracles\nwhich no one thought possible only four years ago.\nOur success in opting for democracy on the basis of\npluralism and the multiparty system clearly demonstrates that\nthe seeds of democracy can germinate in any soil once it is\nplanted and is not the preserve of any special soil. No one\nshould marvel, however, at the success of democracy in our\ncountry. Yemen, as historians know, was the first cradle of\nthe practice of \\\"Shura\\\", that is to say parliamentary activity,\nfrom as far back as the days of the Kingdom of Sab\u00e3 2,800\nyears ago. This is attested to in the Holy Koran and other\nearlier books of revelation.\nThree years have passed since the unfortunate invasion\nof Kuwait by Iraq and the second Gulf crisis that ensued.\nMy country continues to suffer the terrible consequences of\nthat crisis. One million of our expatriate countrymen had to\nreturn to Yemen as a result of that war, and yet we have not\nreceived any external assistance from any quarter whatever\nto lighten the burden of that return. The Republic of Yemen\nis and has always been against the use of armed force in\nresolving conflicts. We reject the idea of the acquisition of\nthe territories of others by force. That is why our position\non this situation remains unchanged. We consider that\nKuwait is a sovereign, independent State and not part of any\nother State. Since the Republic of Yemen is an Arab\ncountry that, geographically, is part of the Arabian\nPeninsula, we have been deeply chagrined by what happened\nbetween the two neighbouring, sister countries of Iraq and\nKuwait, and by the resultant deep cracks in the edifice of\nArab solidarity. For that reason, the Republic of Yemen has\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncontinued to urge the Iraqi leaders to carry out all that is\ncalled for in international resolutions. In that context the\nresponsiveness and readiness to cooperate demonstrated until\nnow by the Government of Iraq are cause for optimism and\nshould lead us to review the sanctions that are now in place.\nSimilarly, ensuring the territorial integrity and\nsafeguarding the sovereignty and independence of the\nRepublic of Kuwait are an absolute necessity. None the\nless, this can never be achieved in a lasting and definitive\nmanner unless the two countries reach a mutually acceptable\nformula of agreement and the Arab countries, in particular,\nas well as the international community as a whole, guarantee\nstrict adherence to such agreement so that neither of the two\ncountries may breach it. Such agreement should make it\npossible to reassure the State of Kuwait that the events of\n2 August 1990 will not recur and also make it possible to\nresolve all outstanding issues so as to prevent any future\ndispute.\nThere is no doubt that our Kuwaiti brethren are well\naware of the fact that the sovereignty, independence and\nsecurity of Kuwait cannot be guaranteed indefinitely by\ndependence on international protection alone but must have\nits solid basis in sound and equitable relations between their\ncountry and Iraq in the framework of a climate of security\nand fraternal reconciliation in the region.\nGiven Iraq\u2019s readiness to cooperate in the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, we believe\nthat the blockade against Iraq is no longer justified. Indeed,\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people has reached an intolerable\nlevel, and we do not believe that the international\ncommunity is prepared to accept the death of innocent\nwomen, children and old people because of lack of\nmedication. At the same time, my country reaffirms the\nneed to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq,\nand we ask that there be no further destruction of Iraq\u2019s\neconomic, scientific and social infrastructures.\nFollowing the establishment of the Republic of Yemen,\nmy country declared that one of the goals of Yemeni unity\nis to contribute to the security and stability of our region and\nto promote cooperation and integration between all its\ncountries. In pursuance of that objective, relations between\nOman and Yemen have been strengthened and have become\na model to be followed. However, this sound beginning is\nbut a key, albeit an important key, to the doors which, when\nfully opened, will allow movement on the economic, security\nand trade tracks towards economic integration and security\ncooperation between all the region\u2019s countries especially now\nthat between Yemen and Oman there are the initial steps\ntowards easy access for passengers and goods. There is no\ndoubt that Yemeni-Omani relations are of special\nsignificance to the future stability and prosperity of the\nregion. They represent a practical and important beginning\nto the much needed process of putting the Arab house in\norder both at the regional and the Arab levels. They are also\nrelations that pose no threat to the interests of others as they\nare open, transparent and well-defined as regards their ends\nand means.\nSimilarly, Yemen\u2019s relations with other sister countries\nare based on historic kinship and religious links and on the\nfact that we all belong to one and the same Nation. That is\nthe reason why Yemen has always stood by its brethren in\nneighbouring countries and in the Arab world in general and\nhas always endeavoured to raise such relations to the level\nthat would enable it to perform its role vis-\u00e0-vis Arab and\ninternational issues.\nAs regards the border issues between Yemen and Saudi\nArabia, Yemen has been engaged since November 1972 in\ntalks with our brethren in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in\na climate of goodwill and with a genuine desire to turn a\nnew leaf. Following initial contacts last year in Geneva, a\njoint committee of experts was set up to negotiate the border\nproblem that lies at the forefront of the two countries\u2019\nbilateral concerns. That committee has held five rounds of\nnegotiations, the most recent of which was held at T\u2019az two\nmonths ago. In the meantime, other contacts have been\ntaking place between President Ali Abdullah Saleh and\nKing Fahd, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, through an\nexchange of letters, the last of which was the letter I\ndelivered to His Majesty King Fahd. Notwithstanding the\ncomplexities of the border problem between the two sister\ncountries, we continue to be optimistic as to the outcome of\nnegotiations, since both countries are desirous of seeing the\ntalks crowned with success and since good intentions exist\non both sides. This makes it easier and possible to resolve\nproblems. Everyone is well aware that factors tending to\nrapprochement between the two countries outweigh the\nfactors of discord. I can say that my last contact with\nKing Fahd, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, was\npositive and that I found him to be aware of the need for\nfraternity and cooperation between our two countries.\nThe deplorable situation in Somalia demands that, in\naddition to what the international forces are doing to\nestablish peace and security there and in addition to\ninternational support, further efforts should be deployed to\ninitiate national reconciliation between the various factions.\nWe urge the international community to redouble its efforts\nat the humanitarian level and we invite the factions in\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13\nSomalia to rise to the level of their responsibilities and to\nwork on a basis conducive to reconciliation, to reject\nfactionalism and false sensitivities and to see that the\ncountry\u2019s interests triumph over narrow, factional ones so\nthat it may be possible to rebuild what has been destroyed\nby that cruel war and pursue the path of development and\nprogress.\nAlthough Yemen previously had the honour of taking\npart in the efforts deployed to achieve national reconciliation\nthrough the Conference held in Djibouti two years ago, and\nalthough the national groups in Somalia have not committed\nthemselves to implementing the resolutions of that\nConference, we shall spare no effort in working for the\ndesired comprehensive national reconciliation in Somalia. It\nis only fair to commend here the role performed by our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the\ninterest he takes in the Somalia tragedy. Let us pray that\nGod the all-powerful will guide the leaders of the various\nfactions in Somalia towards reconciliation so that peace may\nprevail over all parts of that sister country and enable it to\nwork towards reconstruction and development and to resume\nits place as an active member of the international\ncommunity.\nAny observer who is familiar with the history of the\nArab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East region will be\ncertainly aware of the fact that the identity and destiny of\nPalestine have been at the core of the Arab-Israeli problem\nfrom the very outset, and the fuse that detonated the terrible\nexplosion of conflict from as far back as the British\nmandate. Since then, the Palestinian cause has continued to\nbe the focal point of the conflict, which has lasted for\ndecades and has led to three bloody wars; taken thousands\nof lives and caused millions to leave their homes; broken\napart thousands of families; destroyed property; and caused\nincalculable losses. Therefore, it is no wonder that the just\nsettlement of the question of Palestine is the key to resolving\nthe conflict and restoring peace.\nOur country\u2019s prompt support for the agreement\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in\nWashington on 13 September stemmed from our\ncommitment to the Rabat Arab Summit Conference\nresolution which recognized the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization as the sole legitimate representative of the\nPalestinian people as well as our respect for the right of\nevery people to choose its own course and exercise its own\nwill in full freedom. Having said all this, we view the\nagreement as an important first step towards a just, lasting\nand comprehensive peace in the region, as was stated by the\nCouncil of Ministers of the Arab Nations in Cairo last\nmonth. None the less, this step by itself and in itself will\nnot bring about peace unless it is followed by more\nsignificant steps at the levels of other Arab-Israeli\nnegotiating tracks. This will depend on Israel\u2019s earnestness\nwith regard to withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab\nterritories it has continued to occupy since June 1967.\nIf we tell ourselves that Israel, at long last, has come to\nthe realization that it is unrealistic to hold on to the policy\nof depending on naked force due to the military superiority\nit enjoys, as a means of guaranteeing its continued existence,\nimposing its hegemony over the Arab people in Palestine\nand the neighbouring Arab States and imposing a peace that\nwould be tantamount to capitulation - I say that if we tell\nourselves anything of the sort, we shall be indulging in\nwishful thinking until such time as Israel demonstrates the\ntruthfulness of its declared intentions and passes the test by\nadopting sound positions in current and future negotiations\nwith the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese and by\nwithdrawing from all the territories it now occupies. It must\nalso accept the establishment of the independent State of\nPalestine, which would include Gaza and the West Bank,\nwith Jerusalem as its capital, while the Republic of Yemen\nappreciates the important role played by the two co-sponsors\nof the Arab-Israeli negotiations and, in particular, the role of\nthe United States of America, it hopes that this role will be\nsuch as to prompt Israel to abandon the policy of force and\narrogance which it has pursued out of its feelings of military\nsuperiority, and because of the international support and\nprotection it has always enjoyed as well as the special\ntreatment extended to it by the Western Powers. It is time\nthe States of the world at large, and in particular the United\nStates, shouldered the responsibility of curbing Israeli\narrogance, especially after the crimes, killings, acts of\nintimidation and terrorization, the bombings, destruction and\natrocities it has perpetrated for decades in Palestine and\nother Arab countries. Those are acts that will shame\nmankind for a long time to come and that will torture the\nhuman conscience.\nWe do hope that the Gaza-Jericho agreement between\nthe PLO and Israel and the agenda between Jordan and\nIsrael will be accompanied by Israeli-Syrian agreements and\nIsraeli-Lebanese agreements in the near future. This should\nlead to the return of the Golan to Syria and to Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon. We also hope that such\nagreements will be followed by others that would lead to\nIsrael\u2019s total withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories,\nincluding Al-Quds and all the other Arab territories that are\nstill under occupation. It is also our hope that the Israeli\nauthorities will finally desist from the arbitrary measures and\nacts of criminality against all our brethren in Palestine, in\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nLebanon and in the other occupied territories. If the battle\nfor peace has been joined, it shall not be won unless Israel\nshows a great deal of courage, abandons its arrogance and\nrealizes that this is the most difficult battle of all.\nThe end of the cold war and the emergence of the\nbeginnings of a new international order that is beginning to\ntake shape to rid the world of wars and conflicts require that\nlasting, total peace should prevail in the Middle Eastern\nregion on a fair and stable basis so that its peoples may\ntackle the task of development and improve their standards\nof living. This requires that all the States and peoples of the\nworld should take a firm stand in opposing any attempt to\ncreate obstacles in the path of peace, or to impose peace by\nforce. Our world will not enjoy peace until peace embraces\nevery part of the globe.\nLike many other countries, Yemen has followed with\ndeep concern the attacks against southern Lebanon and the\nBekaa Valley by Israel in the month of July, in full sight of\nthe international community. Yemen, while stressing the\nimportance of respecting Lebanon\u2019s independence, territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty and safeguarding its right to live\nwithin recognized international borders, condemns Israel\u2019s\ncontinued occupation of southern Lebanon, and demands\nunconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978).\nThe international community should take a firm stand in\norder to compel Israel to refrain from these acts of\naggression and to compensate the people of Lebanon for the\nenormous losses they have sustained.\nIt is inadmissible, illegal and immoral for peoples, on\nthe eve of the twenty-first century, to suffer from injustice\nand to be exposed to physical liquidation for ethnic or\nreligious reasons. The most horrendous example of this is\nthe case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations,\nsince it was created, has never faced a more serious\nchallenge than the one that confronts it now in that peaceful\nEuropean Muslim country. It is very difficult indeed to\nunderstand the stance of the international community with\nregard to that situation. In practice, all the slogans have\nturned out to be no more than hot air. Developments in\nBosnia and Herzegovina squarely put a heavy burden of guilt\non the shoulders of the international community and\nespecially the major Powers, with regard to the collective\nmassacring of Muslims at the hands of the Serb and Croat\nfascists. As long as we, as an international community,\ncontinue to fail to face up to such a situation, and to\nsafeguard the right to life of the unarmed people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, how could we pretend to champion human\nrights on this planet? In the most restrained terms, we can\nonly say that the world\u2019s stance vis-\u00e0-vis what is happening\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a stigma, a brand of Cain\non the brow of the age and of the human race, for all\neternity.\nConsequently, this blatant defiance calls for practical\nmeasures by the international community to deter aggression,\nto intensify moral support and humanitarian assistance and\nto strengthen the steadfastness of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina with a view to ending this tragedy. We in\nYemen join the other countries of the world in calling for an\nend to this aggression that Belgrade supports, and for a halt\nto the genocidal atrocities perpetrated by the Serb aggressors\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe support the request by the Non-Aligned Movement\nfor the venue of the negotiations to be moved from Geneva\nto United Nations Headquarters here in New York as those\nnegotiations are now at a critical juncture, and moving them\nto New York would strengthen the parties\u2019 confidence,\nespecially that of the Bosnia and Herzegovina side, which is\nthe party that has to make the biggest sacrifice.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held in\nVienna in June 1993 has studied the question of human\nrights, reviewed the fundamental precepts relating to those\nrights and underscored the need to implement them and to\nprovide humanitarian assistance to the victims of war and\nnatural disasters. Unfortunately, many of the tragic\nsituations which afflict people arise from certain crises and\npolitical conflicts that degenerate into armed confrontations.\nThe use of force and economic blockades that ensue result\nin untold suffering for innocent civilians, especially the most\nvulnerable, namely, women, children and the elderly, who\nare always the principal victims of such wars and blockades.\nThe situation in South Africa continues to be cause for\nconcern for most Member States of this Organization. The\nlatest news does not justify too much optimism. Over the\npast two months, there have been several massacres and\nkillings. That is why the most recent events should prompt\nus - and the United Nations - to monitor this situation\nclosely so that the goals contained in the 14 December 1989\nUnited Nations Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive\nConsequences in Southern Africa may be implemented.\nThe decision to deploy a peace-keeping force in South\nAfrica, a decision that has been welcomed by Inkatha, is a\nmajor step in leaving behind the cycle of violence, murder\nand massacre in the country, and may well make it possible\nto establish a democratic and non-racial regime. Here we\nshould like to emphasize the importance of having all the\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15\nparties understand the need for peace, especially in view of\nthe forthcoming democratic, non-racial elections scheduled\nfor next year. We hope that the elections will be successful,\nand that they will mark a positive turning-point.\nJust a few days ago, we had the honour of hearing\nMr. Nelson Mandela address the Special Committee against\nApartheid, and we could feel his confidence in the future.\nWe hope that the dialogue that has now begun in South\nAfrica will make it possible to establish a democratic, non-\nracial regime.\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report on the\nactivities of the United Nations, declared that political\nprogress and economic development are inseparable. Yemen\nbelieves that, to revitalize economic growth in the\ndeveloping countries and enable those countries to continue\ntheir political and economic adjustment programmes, the\ndonor countries and the industrialized countries must provide\neconomic and technical support, and the United Nations\nmust continue to play its role in promoting cooperation\nbetween the developing and the industrialized countries in\norder to achieve the objective of economic integration on an\nequitable basis. It is also important to lighten the poor\ncountries\u2019 debt burdens, to increase financial flows towards\nthem and to provide them with technical assistance in order\nto enable them to continue their programmes of adjustment\nand to achieve economic and social development.\nAs underscored by the meeting of the Ministerial\ncommittee for the economic development of the countries of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement held last May in Bali, Indonesia,\nthe economic situation in the developing countries has\nworsened. World economic growth is suffering from a\ngrave imbalance and the gap between the developing and the\ndeveloped countries has widened. The economic recession\nhas led to the growth of protectionism and declining\ndevelopment assistance. Furthermore, the increase in\nindebtedness and the burdens of debt servicing have resulted\nin capital outflows in the case of the developing countries.\nThis is a situation that threatens the very existence of those\ncountries and not only the prospects of economic and social\ndevelopment. We must refer in this respect to failure by the\nindustrialized countries to honour their commitments in line\nwith the agreements, strategies and international resolutions\nrelating to the inflows of development assistance to the\ndeveloping countries, especially those included in the\ninternational strategy for the eighties which called for the\nallocation by the industrialized countries of 0.7 per cent of\ntheir Gross National Product to development assistance.\nInstead of implementing those resolutions, the industrialized\ncountries have resisted every attempt to formulate and adopt\na new strategy for the 1990s. They have also failed to\nimplement the programme for the 1990s that had been\nagreed upon at the Paris Conference. This has been a real\nsetback for the economic and social development of the least\ndeveloped countries.\nWe do say that the principal responsibility for\ndevelopment lies with the developing countries themselves,\nbut national efforts alone are not enough: there must also be\na degree of international support and assistance. National\nefforts must be backed up by appropriate international\nefforts.\nWe feel that the international economic system must be\nfair and equitable towards the developing countries. This\ncannot be the so without political will, wisdom and courage.\nA great deal of work awaits the United Nations, and\nthis is why this session of the General Assembly is of\nspecial importance. The international community must avail\nitself of this opportunity to develop a concept of cooperation\nbetween countries, within the framework of the United\nNations, with a view to strengthening international peace and\nsecurity and economic stability the world over. This should\nalso help to strengthen the Organization, because the\nOrganization is the ideal framework for building that world\nof peace and stability on the basis of international legality.\nIn this connection, the United Nations must implement\nthe Charter without selectivity or double standards, for the\nCharter is the ideal framework for coordinating international\nefforts. As the international community must build a better\nworld within the framework of the United Nations to ensure\npeace and development, we, the family of nations, must have\nthe foresight and resolve to face up to the problems that\narise with the universal character of the United Nations in\nmind.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it gives\nme great pleasure to see you, a son of the Caribbean,\npresiding over the General Assembly at this forty-eight\nsession with the skill, competence and wealth of experience\nwe have come to associate with you. My delegation is\nconfident that under your leadership this session of the\nGeneral Assembly will complete its vitally important agenda.\nI also wish to express to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, our\nappreciation for the most able manner in which he presided\nover the forty-seventh session.\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMay I take this opportunity also to welcome\nformally to the United Nations the six countries - the Czech\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic, The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra - which\njoined the Organization this year.\nToday the global community is at a crossroads in\nhistory, poised between the prospect of peaceful economic\nprogress through globalization and technological\nadvancement and a relapse into conflict fuelled by poverty,\npolitical tyranny and ethnic strife. This situation has\nemerged with the end of the cold war, which has ushered in\nideological d\u00e9tente, and where the threat of nuclear conflict\nbetween super-Powers has receded. This is not, however, a\ncause for complacency, because unsupervised economic\nglobalization coupled with an escalation of political\nfragmentation could ignite fierce conflict between economic\nblocs and social groups world wide. The present dilemma\nis how we can capitalize collectively on the advantage\noffered by economic globalization, while avoiding political\nfragmentation owing to the resurgence of religious and\nethnic intolerance and chauvinistic nationalism.\nGlobalization, if not complemented by a comprehensive\nglobal economic framework, could lead to wider disparities\nbetween developed and developing countries, leaving a\ngrowing portion of the world\u2019s population mired in poverty\nas entire productive sectors and economic activities are\nmarginalized from the dynamic of economic growth in the\nworld economy. The United Nations is the only forum that\ncan forge a global institutional consensus, a multilateral\nregulatory regime, and commonly subscribe to goals and\nunderstandings that will reduce the tendency to economic\ninequities. A shared economic development consensus could\nprovide the basis for more equitable participation for the less\ndeveloped countries.\nWhether mankind succeeds in seizing the present\nopportunity for peace and economic progress depends\ncrucially on the United Nations as a mechanism for a new\nglobal dialogue based on genuine partnership between States\nwith widely differing philosophies, policies and practices.\nThe United Nations, with severe constraints of financial and\nhuman resources, has in the past year courageously\nattempted to meet these challenges, understandably with\nmixed results.\nWe therefore wish to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General and his dedicated staff of professionals\nwho have played a critical role in the search for resolution\nof bitter conflicts in every region - conflicts which have\ninflicted massive human suffering and devastation of the\nland.\nIn Cambodia, elections have taken place and a new\nGovernment has been installed. That achievement in\nCambodia will, we hope, mark the beginning of a new era\nof peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nOn the African continent, we welcome the signing of\nthe Cotonou Peace Agreement on 25 July, and we urge that\nall the parties to the conflict in Liberia remain committed to\nthis Agreement and work with the United Nations and the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nto bring lasting peace to that country. Unfortunately, the\nsituation in Somalia continues to be tragic and dangerous.\nWe hope that, through the efforts of the United Nations\nOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and others, there will be\na speedy return of peace to this land fractured and\ndevastated by civil strife. Jamaica regrets the continuing\nloss of life of members of the UNOSOM forces.\nDevelopments in South Africa are moving in a positive\ndirection. We welcome the decision to hold, on\n27 April 1994, elections open to all parties which will mark\nthe transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial\nsociety, and we eagerly anticipate the establishment of the\nTransitional Executive Council. The call by Mr. Mandela\nfor the removal of sanctions is a welcome one. Jamaica has\nparticipated in building consensus for the United Nations\nresolution to lift sanctions, and it intends to lift them\nimmediately upon the adoption of the resolution.\nThe situation in the States of the former Yugoslavia is\nalso an agonizing chronicle of tragic strife, suffering and\nabuses. We continue to hope for a just settlement on the\nbasis of Security Council resolution 859 (1993), which\naffirms the fundamental principles on which such a\nsettlement should be based.\nJamaica too hails the signing of the peace accord\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on\n13 September 1993, while fully recognizing that the progress\nachieved, despite its significance, is but an initial step.\nIndeed, there are complex matters that will face negotiators\nin the months and years ahead.\nNearer to home, in the Caribbean, the Government of\nJamaica and its partners in the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) have placed the resolution of the Haitian crisis\nhigh among their priorities. CARICOM has been actively\ninvolved at the United Nations in the effort to bring the issue\nof Haiti before the Security Council, and I express my\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17\nGovernment\u2019s appreciation to the member States of the Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean Group for their support in this\nprocess.\nWe also commend the Special Envoy of the\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States, Mr. Dante Caputo, for his\nuntiring commitment to this issue. However, in the light of\nthe grim evidence that dangerous elements are at work in\nHaiti, clearly determined to deny the Haitian people security,\ndemocracy and development, the international community\ncannot relax its vigilance. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\nis scheduled to return to Haiti on 30 October. His return\nwill mark the beginning of a long and difficult period of\nreconstruction. He will need the full support and\ncommitment of our Organization, as well as of the entire\ninternational community. There is urgency in the call for\neconomic and technical assistance. Indeed, the Government\nof Jamaica has already offered, within our means, to provide\nHaiti with some technical assistance.\nThis new era following the cold war presents mankind\nwith new opportunities for a more rational and equitable\nmanagement of problems at the global level. I refer, in\nparticular, to the struggle against poverty and ethnic strife,\nhuman-rights violations and environmental degradation. The\nend of cold-war confrontations - political as well as military\nand ideological - should not be replaced by economic\nconflict. We must grasp the opportunity for constructive\naction and now work towards an era of cooperation that is\nnot distorted by ideological and political tensions.\nThe Security Council Summit meeting on\n31 January 1992 concluded with a statement in which it was\nsaid that its members recognized\n\\\"that peace and prosperity are indivisible and that\nlasting peace and stability require effective international\ncooperation for the eradication of poverty and the\npromotion of a better life for all in larger freedom\\\".\n(S/23500, p. 5)\nWe strongly support that view.\nFor many developing countries, including my own,\nmarket-oriented reforms have been a high priority. We have\nmade fundamental changes in economic policy, including\nmonetary and fiscal austerity, trade liberalization, divestment\nof public enterprises to the private sector, liberalization of\nforeign-exchange markets and general deregulation of\neconomies. In short, we have undertaken a thoroughgoing\nprocess of structural adjustment, which has created a private-\nsector-led, market-driven economy.\nFor countries that are undertaking economic structural\nadjustment the social consequences are high indeed. Tight\nmonetary and fiscal management reduces the capacity to\nprovide basic social services, such as health, education and\nhousing. Yet, if human needs are not adequately met, if\nhuman resources are not developed, we destroy the very\nbasis of sustained development: our people. Migration -\nnational and international - is one of the clearest\nmanifestations of social ills. If people do not find economic\nsecurity in their native land, they go wherever they can find\nit - from rural to urban area; from one country or one\ncontinent to another. So today there are some 35 million\ndisplaced persons. And such people are to be found in every\nregion.\nThe processes of structural adjustment are rendered\nextremely difficult in the absence of sustained international\nsupport - either directly, through the sustained infusion of\nexternal resources by way of development assistance and\ndebt relief, or indirectly, through reduced protectionism in\nindustrialized countries. Let me give an example related to\ndebt. Although my Government has managed to reduce the\nstock of external debt, debt servicing remains the most\ndebilitating constraint on the country\u2019s economic\ndevelopment. The fact that international financial\ninstitutions, to which much of Jamaica\u2019s debt is owed, refuse\nto consider the rescheduling of loans continues to be a major\nconcern of my Government. The consequence of this policy\nis that even those resources generated by developing\ncountries themselves are not available for the pursuit of\nnational development objectives, as they are pre-empted by\ndebt-servicing.\nI should like to refer to trade liberalization and trade\narrangements, especially with regard to countries undergoing\nstructural adjustment. In my own region, the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) has put in place mechanisms to\nenhance regional trade. At the same time, however, the\nCommunity is faced with the Herculean task of avoiding or\nminimizing the likely short-term to medium-term adverse\nimpacts on its members of the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA) when it takes effect. We have had to\nmake vigorous efforts to ensure that the gains achieved\nunder existing agreements are not eroded.\nSimilarly, conditionality applied to loans by\ninternational financial institutions must be designed to be\nmore appropriate to developing economies. More\nspecifically, adjustment must take place over an extended\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nperiod, must minimize social distress and must be growth-\noriented.\nMy delegation therefore attaches great importance to\nthe formulation of an agenda for development. That process\nshould proceed with the sense of urgency and vision with\nwhich the undeniably constructive \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has\nbeen promoted. Such an agenda must be forward-looking\nand must address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to\ndevelopment, taking into account the specific circumstances\nand needs of developing countries and groups of countries.\nIt must first establish, as its basic premise, the need for a\nfavourable international economic environment and a non--\ndiscriminatory trading system, the latter being dependent on\na speedy, balanced and comprehensive outcome to the\nUruguay Round of trade negotiations. Without these\nconditions, the efforts of developing countries to build\nself-sustaining economies - efforts often accompanied by\npainful adjustment strategies and difficult economic-\nliberalization programmes - will be frustrated.\nThe need for a constructive North-South dialogue to be\nreactivated has therefore become urgent, and has certainly\nbecome one of the most pressing challenges we face in\nelaborating our agenda for development. We were\nconsequently appreciative of the initiative taken by the\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to meet with the\nChairman of the Group of 7 in Tokyo. We regard this as an\nencouraging beginning.\nThe agenda for development cannot be complete if it\ndoes not include consideration of the problem of external\nindebtedness and formulation of specific solutions for its\nresolution. A review of the role and functions of the Bretton\nWoods institutions is therefore necessary. Similarly, the\nreality and inevitability of regional economic integration\nprocesses must be confronted in the agenda for development,\nas well as the protection of the environment, following the\nground-breaking achievements of the historic United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development last year in\nRio de Janeiro.\nThe goal of sustainable development provides a holistic\nframework for the United Nations and its Member States to\nshape a world in which care and respect for human beings\nis equalled only by care and respect for the planet which we\ninhabit. At the Earth Summit in Rio, we undertook to\nimplement measures that would safeguard our natural\nhabitat. Some of the decisions taken in Rio have already\nbegun to take effect. These include the establishment of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development and the\npreparations for the convening of the first Global Conference\non Sustainable Development of Small Island States. My\ndelegation wishes to stress the importance of this\nConference, which is to be held in Barbados next year. We\ntake this opportunity to call upon the Members of the\nAssembly to give full support to the adoption by the\nConference of a plan of action for the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States. This will be\nthe first test of our readiness and commitment to implement\nthe decisions taken at the Earth Summit.\nEqually, Jamaica fully supports the World Conference\non Population and Development, to be held in Cairo in 1994;\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\nCopenhagen in 1995; and the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen, to be held in Beijing in 1995.\nIt gives me great pleasure to allude to the 1982 law of\nthe sea Convention, which was signed in Montego Bay,\nJamaica, 11 years ago and has now been ratified by 58\ncountries. I expect that before the end of this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly the sixtieth ratification will\nbe deposited with the Secretary-General, thus setting the\nstage for the Convention\u2019s entry into force. There can be no\nquestion that support for the Convention continues to be\noverwhelming. Our ultimate goal must be to achieve\nuniversal participation in a Convention which is designed for\nmankind as a whole. It is therefore appropriate that all the\nConvention as soon as possible. As the pace of ratification\nintensifies, it could serve as a catalyst for deepening the\nprocess of universalizing the Convention by addressing\ncreatively the manner in which the provisions of the\nConvention are to be implemented on an ongoing,\ncontemporary basis.\nWe must pay a tribute, as well, to the Secretary-General\nand his predecessor for the initiative they took to promote a\ndialogue aimed at addressing issues of concern to some\nStates in order to achieve universal participation in the\nConvention. The integrity of the Convention as a whole\nmust be maintained, and our search for universality must\nrecognize the overwhelming support for the Convention by\nthe international community as a whole and the need to\npreserve its fundamental aspects. Let us therefore in our\nnoble quest for universality concentrate on the manner of the\nimplementation of the Convention in those areas of concern\nto some States.\nIf the United Nations is to play an active and dynamic\nrole in promoting a new global partnership, it must examine\nits capacity and capability. For that reason, my delegation\nagrees that the reform processes now under way should aim\nat maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19\nOrganization. Further, my delegation intends to participate\nfully in the work of the open-ended ad hoc working group\nwhich will continue to consider the process of revitalizing\nthe General Assembly. Other discussions related to the\nrestructuring of the United Nations system must be\ntransparent and informed by the principles of democracy and\nthe rules of international law and by those principles\nenshrined in the Charter.\nMy Government wishes to address the issue of the\nSecurity Council in the context of the increased membership\nof the United Nations, which rose to 184 this year. The\nsurging tide of change over the past five years has seen the\nresponsibilities of the Security Council increase, with the\nestablishment of 17 peace-keeping operations and the\nCouncil\u2019s further involvement in conflict resolution through\nthe good offices of the Secretary-General and the dispatch of\nfact-finding missions. The time has therefore obviously\ncome for a review of the Security Council\u2019s composition to\nensure that it is truly representative of the increased\nmembership of the United Nations and reflects the\ndemocratic principle on which the United Nations is founded -\nthat is, the sovereign equality of all States.\nThe reform process in which we are now engaged\nwithin the United Nations must clearly include the Security\nCouncil, the body charged with the responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. A Security\nCouncil which is truly representative and functions\neffectively has to be a priority for all of us, because peace\nand security, in the military and political sense, are\ninterwoven with our economic and social security. We in\nthe Caribbean cannot, and have no desire to, remain aloof\nfrom this debate. We must ensure that a strengthened\nUnited Nations is placed in a position to play a dominant\nrole in the elaboration of processes of peace and\ndevelopment and in their implementation based on genuine\ninterdependence, global partnership and shared responsibility.\nWe are gathered here because we all have pressing\nnational concerns and we believe there remains an enduring\nfaith in multilateralism, which carries the potential for\nstronger, more broadly based development over the longer\nterm, if only all players agree to reaffirm their commitment\nand play fully their roles within the global framework of\ncooperation.\nThere is no doubt that this will be difficult, but shared\nobjectives, shared commitment and shared responsibilities\nwill ensure a better world for all mankind. As we\ncontemplate the challenges posed by the present global,\neconomic and political environment, we must commit\nourselves to a new dialogue within the United Nations\nsystem to forge a global partnership for peace, democracy\nand economic progress.\n"

        "file_text": "\nAllow me to begin by extending to you, Sir, my sincere\ncongratulations on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident that\nyour solid diplomatic background and rich experience will\neffectively contribute to the success of the work of this\nsession.\nMore than ever before, our Organization today needs\ncooperation between its Member States if it is to save itself\nfrom attempts to divert its course from the spirit and\nprinciples of its Charter and thereby turn it into a tool for\nserving the selfish interests of certain dominant Powers, first\namong which is the United States of America.\nThe world has attached great importance to the end of\nthe bipolarity that overshadowed the international situation\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nuntil recently and restricted the ability of the United Nations\nto address and resolve international problems. The new era,\nhowever, has failed to provide the United Nations with the\nopportunity to apply the principles, objectives and\nmechanisms of the Charter. A single Power - the United\nStates of America - has sought to control the manner in\nwhich the United Nations addresses international issues and\nto steer it in accordance with United States interests.\nThe selectivity and double standard that characterize the\nrole currently played by the United Nations make it crystal\nclear that the United Nations and the Security Council in\nparticular have become tools that execute the policies of the\nPowers that dominate the Organization. The United Nations\nis no longer a world Organization capable of resolving the\nproblems and addressing the crises which beset many\ncountries and peoples of the world in a manner that is\nconsonant with the objectives and principles of its own\nCharter.\n\nWhat did the Security Council ever do to implement its\nresolution 487 (1981), on the military aggression perpetrated\nby Israel against an Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peaceful\npurposes? That resolution was adopted 12 years ago and the\nSecurity Council has done absolutely nothing to implement\nit. Indeed, we have reached the point today at which the\nIsraeli Deputy Defence Minister, Mordechai Gur, can\narrogantly declare, as he did on 6 June 1993, that Israel does\npossess nuclear weapons and that it has the capacity to bomb\nthe Arab States with those devices. At the same time, Israel\ncontinues to adamantly refuse to sign the non-proliferation\nTreaty and the United Nations and the Security Council have\ndone absolutely nothing to halt the Israeli programmes of\nmass destruction weapons, which include the production and\nstockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons\ntogether with the means of their delivery, regardless of the\nfact that those programmes constitute a grave threat to the\nsecurity and stability of the region and the whole world.\nWhile the United Nations is being forced to engage in\na military operation in Somalia under the pretext of\nproviding humanitarian assistance, the United Nations stands\nhelpless and incapable of taking any appropriate action to\nput an end to the carnage or to alleviate the bitter human\nsuffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of\nformer Yugoslavia. This paralysis takes place against the\nbackdrop of the shifting tides of the positions of the\ndominant Powers in line with their own selfish interests and\nschemes and their backing away from any measure that\nwould help in reaching a solution or put an end to this\ntragedy.\nBecause of the climate prevailing in the international\ncommunity - a climate of selectivity and double standards -\nthe gap between North and South continues to widen at the\nexpense of the interests of the developing countries and Iraq\nfinds itself in a situation that has never been witnessed\nbefore by any other founding State Member of the United\nNations. This is due to the complications and unfair\ntreatment meted to Iraq by the resolutions of the Security\nCouncil under pressure exerted by the United States of\nAmerica and its hegemonistic policies towards others.\nThe most telling example of the hegemony exercised by\nthe United States of America over the United Nations and of\nUnited States monopoly of the interpretation and\nimplementation of the provisions of the Charter, and use of\nthe mechanisms related thereto in the service of purely\nAmerican rather than common international interests, is what\nhas been done and continues to be done to Iraq at a time\nwhen it has declared its commitment to the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council which it fully implements. In return, Iraq\ncontinues to be subjected to acts of aggression which\nthreaten its security and territorial integrity and infringe upon\nits sovereignty.\nIraq also remains deprived of its natural right to obtain\nits needs, including those described in international legal\nterms as basic human and civilian needs. Those needs are\nessential for the people of Iraq if they are to continue to lead\na normal life. Iraq also remains deprived of the right to\nexport its natural resources while its assets remain frozen.\nIraq continues to be denied the right to use its civil aircraft\nand ships and continues to be subjected to flagrant military\nintervention in its internal affairs, to daily acts of violation\nof its airspace, and to the perpetration of a declared\nconspiracy against its political system.\nIraq has endeavoured, despite all these adverse\ncircumstances and difficulties, to contain the crises which\ncertain powers have so skilfully orchestrated in order to\nperpetrate further aggression against Iraq and create pretexts\nfor continuing to impose the iniquitous comprehensive\nblockade against it. Within the framework of Iraq\u2019s serious,\ncontinuous attempts to reveal the truth, close the door on the\nforces of ill-intent and expose their objectives, and driven by\nits desire to find solutions to the outstanding issues through\na serious responsible dialogue based on justice and fairness\nand consistent with international law and the United Nations\nCharter, Iraq has called, in a letter dated 30 May 1993 from\nthe Foreign Minister of Iraq to the President of the Security\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21\nCouncil, for constructive and comprehensive dialogue with\nthe Security Council within the framework of the legal and\npractical interrelationship between Iraq\u2019s implementation of\nits obligations and the text of resolution 687 (1991) on the\none hand, and the Security Council\u2019s implementation of its\nown obligations towards Iraq according to the provisions of\nthe said resolution, particularly paragraphs 21 and 22, on the\nother.\nIraq calls for the Security Council to adopt fair and just\npositions which would reflect the Council\u2019s respect for its\nown obligations and commitments as enshrined in the United\nNations Charter, and thereby to respect the sovereignty,\nindependence, internal security and territorial integrity of\nIraq, lift the unjust blockade that has been imposed upon the\npeople of Iraq for three years now, and which has inflicted,\nand continues to inflict, untold suffering upon them and to\nlift all the restrictions that are still imposed without\njustification on normal, legitimate Iraqi activities.\nIraq has cooperated objectively with all the inspection\nteams and missions dispatched by the United Nations, in\norder to fulfil its obligations according to the resolutions of\nthe Security Council, regardless of how unjust and indeed\nhow extremely iniquitous those resolutions are. In fact many\nof the officials of those teams and missions have confirmed\nthat Iraq has honoured its obligations in implementation of\nthe Security Council resolutions.\nMay I refer here, by way of example, to the statement\nmade by the United Nations Special Commission\n(UNSCOM) Executive Chairman, Mr. Rolf Ekeus, on\n13 January 1993, in which he said, \\\"Iraq\u2019s compliance has\nbeen a success so far, and it would be tragic if the last 5 per\ncent of implementation could not to be carried out.\\\" Earlier,\non 2 September 1992, Mr. Maurizio Zifferero, the head of\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection\nteam, said, \\\"Iraq\u2019s nuclear programme stands at zero now.\\\"\nConvinced that Iraq has met all its obligations under\nresolution 687 (1991), we called upon the Security Council,\nboth as a collective body and as individual Member States,\njust as we had long been calling upon the Special\nCommission, to conduct a technical, professional and legal\ndialogue with Iraq in order to specify the extent to which\nresolution 687 (1991) in general, and section C thereof in\nparticular, have been implemented, so that the Council may\nconsider implementing paragraphs 21 and 22 of the\nresolution, which pertain to the lifting of the economic\nsanctions imposed on Iraq. The dialogue proposed by Iraq\nwas also meant to strip away all the pretexts that have\ncontinued to be used to mask the illegal and aggressive\nmeasures unilaterally taken by certain individual States\nagainst Iraq and its territorial integrity. The most flagrant of\nthose measures are the so-called \\\"no-fly zones\\\" imposed on\nnorthern and southern Iraq and the military acts of\naggression perpetrated by the United States against Iraq on\n17 January 1993 and 27 June 1993.\nWhen the Security Council responded, in July 1993, to\nour call for dialogue and sent the Executive Chairman of the\nSpecial Commission to Baghdad to conduct talks with the\nIraqi side, we welcomed the visit and held intensive, frank\nand constructive discussions with Mr. Ekeus, through which\nwe reached an agreement to resolve a number of issues and\nto continue our dialogue in earnest on grounds that are just,\nfair, logical and consistent with international law and the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nWe presented to Mr. Ekeus, and through him to the\nSecurity Council, a position paper clearly expressing the way\nin which Iraq envisages the relationship between Iraq\u2019s\nresponsibilities towards the Security Council and its\nresolutions, on the one hand, and the responsibilities of the\nSecurity Council, both as a body and as Member States,\ntowards Iraq\u2019s firm rights and legitimate demands, foremost\namong which are the following: to respect the sovereignty,\ninternal security and dignity of the people and State of Iraq;\nto guarantee Iraq\u2019s right to development and to industrial,\nscientific and technological progress; to implement\nparagraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991),\npertaining to the lifting of the embargo on Iraq now that Iraq\nhas accomplished what is required of it under the provisions\nof section C of that resolution; to work in earnest towards\nthe implementation of paragraph 14 of resolution 687 (1991),\npertaining to the establishment in the Middle East of a zone\nfree of weapons of mass destruction and the means of their\ndelivery and to bring to an immediate end the so-called\n\\\"no-fly zones\\\" imposed on northern and southern Iraq, which\nconstitute an illegal use of armed force by three permanent\nmember States of the Security Council, aimed at interfering\nin the internal affairs of a Member State of the United\nNations.\nIraq reiterated its positive positions and its desire for\ndialogue during the meetings held last month here in New\nYork by the Iraqi high-level technical delegation. We have\nalso endeavoured to ensure that this positive spirit prevails\nin the current round of meetings which started in Baghdad\non 2 October 1993. We look forward to seeing this round\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsucceed in solving all outstanding issues in a complete and\nfinal manner so that the Security Council may begin in\nearnest to implement paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991)\nwhich states that the Security Council:\n\\\"Decides that upon the approval by the Security\nCouncil of the programme called for in paragraph 19\nabove and upon Council agreement that Iraq has\ncompleted all actions contemplated in paragraphs 8, 9,\n10, 11, 12 and 13 above, the prohibitions against the\nimport of commodities and products originating in Iraq\nand the prohibitions against financial transactions\nrelated thereto contained in resolution 661 (1990) shall\nhave no further force or effect\\\".\nIn view of these developments, and in order for the\nprinciples of justice and equity and of the mutuality of rights\nand obligations between Iraq and the Security Council to\nprevail, we hereby call upon all countries of the world to\nsupport our initiative for dialogue and understanding between\nthe Council and Iraq so that such dialogue may lead without\ndelay to the lifting of the unjust and iniquitous blockade\nimposed on our country, and thereby to put an end to the\nmethods of coercion, threats and aggression being used\nagainst our country.\nWe also call upon the countries of the world to urge the\nSecurity Council, both as a collective body and as individual\nMember States, to consider Iraq\u2019s legitimate demands as\nexpressed in the Iraqi position paper submitted to the\nSecurity Council in July 1993. The paper deals with the\nmost important issues, especially respect for Iraq\u2019s\nsovereignty, internal security and territorial integrity, the\nlifting of the iniquitous blockade, the removal of the \\\"no-fly\nzones\\\" illegally imposed on parts of Iraq and abstaining from\nany further aggression against Iraq.\nThe people of Iraq are being subjected to inhumane\npolicies and practices that have further aggravated their\nsuffering which increases from one day to the next. The\ndomination by the United States and its allies over the\nactivities of the Sanctions Committee, which was set up in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 661 (1990), has\nmade that Committee hostage to premeditated political\nobjectives and ill intentions against Iraq and its people. The\nCommittee has ignored the basic civilian and human needs\nof the Iraqi people to the extent that it has refused to allow\nIraq to obtain much needed medical supplies as well as\nequipment and educational supplies for its schools. The\nCommittee has gone as far as to consider paint for school\ndesks and blackboards as well as ink as proscribed materials\nthat the Iraqi people should not be permitted to obtain.\nIn refusing to grant the permission to obtain any of\nthose essential civilian requirements, it resorts to flimsy\npretexts and unacceptable justifications. For instance, the\nCommittee has refused to allow pencils and notebooks to be\nsupplied to Iraq\u2019s schoolchildren, claiming that the quantity\nrequested was too large. The Committee has also rejected\na request for the supply of medical equipment, beds and\nair-conditioning systems for Iraqi hospitals. The reason\ngiven for that refusal was that the end user was not known.\nWhat irony! The Sanctions Committee has refused to allow\nwater purification materials to be supplied to Iraq, rejected\na request submitted by a company for the reconstruction of\na factory producing medical syringes in Iraq and refused to\nallow the importation of spare parts for a baby-food factory\nin Iraq under the pretext that such spare parts would\ncontribute to the expansion of the country\u2019s industrial\ncapability.\nThe practices of a limited number of Member States in\nthe Sanctions Committee which seems to have inherited the\nveto privilege under the cover of general consensus, have\ndemonstrated beyond all doubt that the embargo is geared\ntowards destroying Iraqi society with premeditated\npersistence and through organized and calculated efforts\ndriven by political motives that are contrary to all values,\nlaws and norms acceptable to the international community\nnow or in the past.\nThe war of destruction launched against Iraq by the\nUnited States and its allies, the continued imposition of the\ncomprehensive blockade and the denial of Iraq\u2019s right to\nexport its oil and use its frozen assets in foreign banks have\nall combined to make Iraq unable to provide even the most\nelementary of its people\u2019s basic humanitarian needs, such as\nfood and medication. The result has been a huge increase in\nmortality among children and the elderly, due to the grave\nshortage of medicines. On top of all its other difficulties in\nvarious fields, Iraq suffers from, for example, an acute\nshortage of medicines for the treatment of cancer, kidney\nproblems, heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure disorders,\neye diseases, diarrhoea, tuberculosis and other serious\ndiseases. Over the months that have elapsed in 1993,\ntuberculosis-related fatalities among children have risen by\n81 times over the figure registered for the corresponding\nperiod in 1989; and this is but one example.\nI do not wish to elaborate on the difficult humanitarian\nconditions of the Iraqi people. The reports by the various\nmissions and agencies of the United Nations have warned\nagainst the dangerous results of the deteriorating food and\nhealth situation brought upon the Iraqi people as a result of\nthe blockade.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 23\nThe most recent of those reports is Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) document 237, issued in\nJuly 1993 under the title \\\"Special Warning\\\". This document\ndepicts the deterioration of Iraq\u2019s food situation as a result\nof the difficulties facing the agricultural sector because of\nacute shortages of equipment and pesticides and the spread\nof agricultural epidemics. The FAO report also points out\nthat the economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq have led to\nthe spread of deprivation on a massive scale, thus exposing\nthe vast majority of the Iraqi population to acute food\nshortages and malnutrition, particularly children under five\nyears of age. The report also states that the economic\nblockade has practically paralysed the country\u2019s economy\nand led to continued deprivation and the spread of massive\nhuman suffering.\nNot content with its military aggression against Iraq on\n17 January 1991 or with all the inhuman practices it has\npursued against the Iraqi people, the United States of\nAmerica has continued to perpetuate direct and unilateral\nacts of military aggression against Iraq under various false\npretexts and flimsy justifications. In addition to the first\ncolossal aggression of 1991, the United States perpetrated\ntwo further acts of aggression against Iraq\u2019s civilian\npopulation and civilian installations on 17 January 1993 and\n27 June 1993. These two additional acts of aggression\nresulted in the loss of many innocent civilian lives among\nchildren, women and elderly people.\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, the\nUnited States of America has a double responsibility to\nabide by international law and the United Nations Charter.\nThe United States should be the last country to resort to the\nuse of force in resolving disputes, yet it perpetrated\naggression against Iraq on the basis of unfounded and absurd\nallegations that there was a conspiracy against the life of the\nformer United States President. In so doing, the United\nStates Government justified its action by a twisted\ninterpretation of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter\nthat was totally alien to that article\u2019s letter and spirit.\nThis behaviour constitutes a grave escalation of a policy\nthat has been and will certainly continue to be a threat to\ninternational peace and security, a policy that violates the\nright of States to self-defence, as enshrined in the Charter of\nthe United Nations. The behaviour of the United States, in\nparticular its aggression of 27 June 1993, has met with\nrejection and condemnation from many countries round the\nworld, including some allies of the United States itself.\nAs regards the issue of human rights, Iraq proceeds\nfrom a complete belief in those rights and in the fact that\nrespect for, and protection of, human rights remains an\nunquestionable element upon which the internal structure of\nsociety is established and an element that contributes\npositively to the establishment of peace and justice at the\ninternational level. It is on the basis of such conviction and\nsuch understanding that Iraq has acceded to many\ninternational covenants on human rights. Iraq has also\nhonoured its obligations by submitting regular reports\nregarding the situation of human rights. While we realize\nthat many positive developments have taken place in the\nfield of human rights, reflecting the widespread recognition\nof their importance, a recognition further cemented by legal\nprovisions in the various international covenants, these\ndevelopments have not been accompanied, in terms of real\napplication, by an earnest endeavour to help create the right\nclimate for the declared legal provisions to be implemented\nin accordance with the greatly varying circumstances\nprevailing in various States, according to each one\u2019s cultural\nbackground, religious beliefs and level of progress and\ndevelopment. On the contrary: it can be seen that the\nconcept of human rights has become a weapon used by\ncertain States possessing the means of influence with which\nto exert discriminatory pressure on other States for selfish\npolitical objectives and interests rather than for the\nrealization of common objectives and interests of the\ninternational community. What is particularly worrying to\nus is the neglect shown towards basic rights upheld by the\ninternational community and declared as governing principles\nsuch as the right to self-determination, the right to\ndevelopment, the right of States to respect for their\nsovereignty, stability and territorial integrity as well as\nnon-interference in their internal affairs.\nThe great challenges facing the United Nations put the\nOrganization at a decisive crossroads, beyond which we shall\nsee the will of the international community either totally\nparalysed under the influence of dominant Powers, or\nsearching for an outlet through an endeavour to restore\nbalance to the mechanisms governing the process of\ndecision-making and decision-implementation in the various\nUnited Nations agencies, with a view to ensuring the\neffectiveness of the Organization and guaranteeing its ability\nto resolve international problems in accordance with rules of\nfairness, justice and international law, as well as ensuring the\nrevitalization of the role of the United Nations on the basis\nof compatible and unified concepts and criteria and away\nfrom double standards.\nThe enhancement of the United Nations ability to\nmaintain peace requires, above all, strict adherence to the\nobjectives and principles of the Charter, particularly the\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States, the right of\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\npeoples to self-determination, to non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States and to observance of the rules of\ninternational law.\nIraq, as a founding Member of the United Nations, is\nextremely anxious that the Organization\u2019s name and emblem\nremain worthy of respect and continue to be regarded as a\nbeacon of hope by all peoples of the world. We believe that\nmembership in the Security Council should go hand in hand\nwith the new realities brought about by the increased\nmembership of the United Nations, and that this should be\ndone in a manner that would bring about a more equitable\nand balanced representation of all United Nations Member\nStates. The Council should abide by the principles of clarity\nand openness in its decision-making process; it should also\noperate with due regard to respect for the sovereign rights of\nall States.\nMy country supports the thesis put forth by the\nSecretary-General in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\"\nregarding the importance of the role assigned to the General\nAssembly by the United Nations Charter, especially in the\nfield of the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe achievement of the United Nations objectives\nrequires that the mechanisms of the General Assembly\nshould be strengthened within the framework of its spheres\nof competence stipulated by the Charter and that this should\nbe done through discussion and the adoption of resolutions\non subjects of international importance.\nThe strength and vitality of the United Nations are\nclosely linked to the extent of participation by its Member\nStates in the process of decision-making and to their\nequitable representation in the various specialized organs and\nagencies.\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, in his report\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", highlights the fundamental fact that\nsocial peace is just as important as strategic and political\npeace. He stresses that peace cannot be guaranteed within\nthe framework of narrow military concept, as there are\nseveral economic and environmental factors that play their\npart in the maintenance of peace and that those factors can\nthemselves become the fuel for the eruption of conflicts and\nwars between peoples.\nThe need to maintain international peace and security\nputs the United Nations face to face with the responsibility\nof removing the causes of conflict in which economic factors\nplay the vital role.\nIf it is said today that the world has put the dangers of\nthe cold war behind it, we must remind ourselves that our\nworld faces very real dangers that arise from the grave\ndeterioration in the world economic situation, particularly the\nbitter suffering of the developing countries, their increasing\npoverty and the frustration of their development\nprogrammes.\nThe gap has been growing wider and wider between the\nrich industrial North and the poor South which is seeking an\nopportunity for survival as it witnesses the prices of its basic\ncommodities tumble, its foreign trade deteriorate, and its\nresources become prey to plunder and extortion.\nPeace is a concept that cannot be divided. It is a\nfundamental right for mankind, recognized by all religions\nas well as by international covenants. That indivisible\nconcept of peace must combine all dimensions, especially\nthe economic which, if missing, exposes the international\ncommunity to grave problems and dangerous conflicts.\nTo really guarantee international peace and security, we\nmust realize that this depends on the extent to which the\ninherent causes of conflict are removed and that economic\nand social development constitute the most important\nfoundation upon which to establish international peace and\nsecurity.\nOnce we realize this, we shall find that many of the\ncauses of instability arise from economic and social factors.\nThe United Nations should address such factors in all\nseriousness and should give them priority in the activities of\nits various organs, particularly the General Assembly and its\nspecialized agencies, in a manner that would heighten the\nefficacy of the United Nations and the role it plays in\nfacilitating cooperation between States in the fields of\neconomic and social development and in other areas of\ninternational cooperation.\nThis responsibility should be shouldered by the United\nNations on the basis of the principles enshrined in its\nCharter for the enhancement of the factors of economic\ndevelopment and progress and the establishment of\nmultilateral non-discriminatory international economic order\nwhich would be based on respect for the choices made by\ncountries and peoples and which would encourage respect\nfor mutual interests and put an end to exploitation and\nhegemony.\nThe United Nations should focus its efforts on the\nsearch for the practical formulae that would lead to\nconsolidating the national infrastructures and enhancing the\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 25\ncapabilities of the poorer and developing countries and help\nthem overcome their difficulties, implement their\ndevelopment programmes and narrow the huge gap existing\nat present between the rich industrial countries and the\ndeveloping countries. Such an effort will no doubt serve the\ncause of stability, security and peace in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Before beginning my\nstatement, may I on behalf of the Government and the\npeople of Malta express our profound solidarity with the\nGovernment and the people of India and with the families of\nthe victims of the massive earthquake which has claimed the\nlives of thousands and left tens of thousands injured and\nhomeless.\nMr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your\nunanimous election to the presidency of the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. You bring to this\nimportant post a wealth of professional experience and\npersonal qualities which will undoubtedly make their mark\nin the coming weeks and months.\nIn recent years the office of the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly has reasserted its rightful role and\nrelevance in the light of the momentous events that are\noccurring in our time. We have always considered the\npresidency of the Assembly as relevant to the structure and\nperformance of our Organization. The role of the President,\nin our view, should be not only to preside over the\nAssembly, but also to represent it and to speak on its behalf\non the basis of its decisions and resolutions.\nThe United Nations system, with the General Assembly\nat its very centre, is increasingly becoming the effective\nfocal point of international life, as its founders intended.\nThe responsibilities entrusted to the presidency of the\nAssembly in this context are therefore both challenging and\nunique.\nYou are, Mr. President, taking over your new\nresponsibilities from a predecessor who accomplished his\ntask with resourcefulness and success. I wish to take this\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nopportunity to express our appreciation to outgoing President\nGanev for his contribution to the revitalization process of the\nGeneral Assembly. Earlier this year President Ganev visited\nMalta on the occasion of the conference we sponsored\njointly with the United Nations on the subject of Foreign\nMinistries in transition.\nWithin this context, may I welcome those States that\njoined our Organization during the forty-seventh session,\nadding a further dimension to the global representation and\nresponsibilities of the General Assembly. When the United\nNations was founded 51 States were signatories to the\nCharter. Today membership of the United Nations has\nreached 184.\nCircumstances have changed, roles have changed and\npersonalities have changed. However, the fundamentals of\nthis Organization remain unaltered. Though situations may\nat times tempt us to re-invent the wheel, the requirements of\nthe United Nations are evolutionary in concept, answering to\nthe dynamism of world events, calling for our response to\naltered situations. This makes it impellent to move towards\na second-generation United Nations which is strong in its\nresourcefulness and sensitive to the need for its own\nrevitalization.\nA review of some of this year\u2019s international events\nreflects the acceptance of the United Nations as a guarantor\nof peace, able not only to withstand problems as they arise,\nbut also to absorb its own failures and mistakes.\nEvents in former Yugoslavia reflect not only the\nlegacies of a past still present, but also the difficult nature of\nbringing the parties to an agreement at the negotiating table\nwhen so much blood has been shed, so much suffering\ninflicted and crimes against man\u2019s most cherished values\ncommitted.\nOperation \\\"Restore Hope\\\" in Somalia did not fully\nrealize this hope. Indeed, a series of events and mishaps has\ncontributed to the loss of life of valiant soldiers of the\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces as well as the lives of\nmany members of the civilian population. A message of\nincomprehension has taken over the city of Mogadishu.\nDevelopments in Cambodia, on the other hand, are a\npositive manifestation of the growing effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations in its peace-keeping role - an area to which\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\ndedicated so much energy and commitment to ensure the\nwell-being of so many millions living under the threat of\nconflict.\nThe signing of the declaration of principles by the\nIsraelis and the Palestinians is a rainbow for the Middle\nEast. It could well lead to a covenant of peace, breaking a\ncircle of hatred and the legacy of death which has lasted for\ndecades.\n\\\"I believe that these two peoples, victims of the\nadversities of history, require the solidarity and\ninvolvement of all who can help in moulding events\ntowards peace in the region.\\\" (A/45/1000, para. 95)\nThis was one of the conclusions that I drew in reporting\nback to the Assembly, as its President, following my visit to\nthe occupied territories in those bleak days of the first weeks\nof January 1991. I commented that\n\\\"The Arab-lsraeli conflict has a dimension which\ngoes far beyond the territory of Palestine. It involves\nnot only the States in the region, the security concept\nof the Mediterranean, the relations with Europe and the\nsuper-Powers, but it also has an effect on the credibility\nof the United Nations and the political will behind its\nresolutions.\\\" (ibid, para. 89)\nAt the time we tried to explain to both the Israelis and\nthe Palestinians that living in peace with one\u2019s neighbour\nbrings that international environment, with secure and\nguaranteed frontiers, that all States in the region, including\nIsrael, need so much to safeguard their future. In conclusion\nI stated that the purpose of the visit - the first ever by a\nPresident of the Assembly -\n\\\"was intended to pave the way for those who,\nconscious of their political responsibilities, can help in\ncontributing towards a lasting peace, which will give to\nthe peoples in the region man\u2019s most coveted gift;\npeace in freedom.\\\" (ibid, para. 98)\nOne must give credit, in this context, to the receptive\nunderstanding of the then Secretary of State James Baker,\nwith whom I had discussed my visit shortly after my return.\nWith consummate diplomacy, he activated the Madrid\nprocess, leading to a dialogue approach long absent between\nthe parties.\nThe leaders of Israel and of the Palestinians have\nshown moral courage which will, when pursued, send a\nmessage of hope not only to the peoples of the region but to\nmany others who have endured long conflicts and seek the\nroad to peace.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 13\nDevelopments in South Africa have also been\nencouraging. Important progress has been made in\ndismantling the condemned policy of apartheid and in\nbringing together the various communities. Malta is pleased\nto see that this progress has reached the stage at which\nSouth Africa can fully return to the fold of the international\ncommunity as a respected member, mindful of its obligations\nboth at home and abroad. We agree that the lifting of\neconomic sanctions at this stage can and should encourage\nand assist the people of South Africa in completing their\njourney on the difficult road to genuine freedom, dignity and\njustice.\nThe approaching fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations provides an ideal opportunity for the international\ncommunity to take an in-depth look at the means at its\ndisposal in carrying out its endeavours for peace, security\nand prosperity. This anniversary must be seen as an act of\nregeneration. It will highlight the universal richness and\ndiversity of an institution which now encompasses practically\nthe whole of mankind; it will rightly bring to the fore its\nqualities of resilience and perseverance, which have been\ntested and demonstrated time and again over the half\ncentury; it will rightly recall the successes achieved over the\nyears, in spite of often daunting difficulties; and it will salute\nthe many individuals who have faithfully served, and\ncontinue to serve, a few with great visibility and\nprominence, most others quietly and silently, out of the\nlimelight.\nThe process of regeneration must apply both to\ninstitutions and to objectives. Central to the institutional\naspect is the role of the General Assembly. As past\nPresident, I remain personally deeply involved and\ncommitted to the revitalization of this Assembly. Even\ntoday, the international community has yet to fully exploit\nthe uniqueness and relevance of the General Assembly. This\nis the only global forum where all States are full and\npermanent Members; where all States, regardless of size,\npower or wealth, have an equal and sovereign say; where all\nissues, political, economic, social, cultural or humanitarian,\ncan be considered in their entirety and their inter-relatedness;\nand where the process of decision-making is at the same\ntime a process of consensus-building.\nThe Assembly is not, and cannot be seen as, in a\ncontest or competition with any other organ of the United\nNations system. Its role is unique and pre-eminent, and its\ndeliberations can only facilitate, enrich and, as appropriate,\nconsolidate the decisions of other organs.\nSome progress has already been achieved in improving\nthe efficient functioning of the General Assembly. The\nrecent adoption of resolution 47/233 is the most recent and\nwelcome development. We must of course constantly\nremind ourselves that there has to be a clear purpose behind\nmoves towards efficiency. In the case of the General\nAssembly, the purpose lies essentially in enhancing the\neffectiveness and relevance of its deliberative and consensusbuilding role, thus adding to its capacity to follow up and\nimplement its decisions.\nMr. Fajardo Maldonado (Guatemala), Vice-President,\ntook the Chair.\nThe size, composition and methods of operation of the\nSecurity Council have in recent years become subjects of\nintensive debate and sometimes speculation. The Council is\na unique tool in the search for peace and security. It is a\nblend of the idealistic and the pragmatic; it is at one and the\nsame time a deliberative and a functional organ. The lifting\nof the cold war\u2019s constraints has had a most visible and\ncreative impact, releasing and galvanizing the Council\u2019s\npeacemaking and peace-keeping roles. Efforts to enlarge the\nCouncil and expand its functions must come within the\nframework envisaged for the Council under the Charter.\nHowever, Malta shares with all other United Nations\nMembers the legitimate expectation of transparency and\nobjectivity as the hallmark of the Council\u2019s work.\nThe Council must remain conscious of the impact its\ndecisions, especially the imposition of sanctions, could have\non third parties. It is important to link the application of\nsanctions to a compensatory system for those countries\nwhich, through no fault of their own, have to bear the\nburden and pay the price of sanctions. When deciding to\ndeploy United Nations forces, the Council must also be\nconscious of its responsibility for the safety and well-being\nboth of the forces it deploys and of the inhabitants of the\nareas concerned. In all its actions, the Council must be\ninspired by the fundamental peacemaking dimension of its\nmandate and by the Charter\u2019s emphasis on the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes.\nOne of the important objectives of any enlargement of\nthe Council\u2019s membership must be to ensure balance and\nequity in its composition in terms of the present level of\nUnited Nations membership. Account must be taken of\nregional and geographical considerations; of the need to\ncreate reasonable opportunities for all United Nations\nMembers to take their turn in serving on it; and of\nconsiderations relating to the size and status of individual\nUnited Nations Members.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nAn aspect that requires redefining in its application is\nthat of regional responsibility for peace-keeping under\nChapter VIII of the Charter. At the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Helsinki Follow-Up\nMeeting, Malta\u2019s proposal that the CSCE declare itself the\nregional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the\nCharter was endorsed by the Helsinki Summit II. We think\nthat through similar arrangements at the regional levels,\npeace-keeping operations may be more efficiently and\neconomically dealt with by countries which, because of their\nregional obligations, can assume further responsibilities.\nThis trend has already been manifesting itself in recent\nyears, and one can only hope that it will be further applied\nand consolidated.\nWe believe that the concept of collective security\ndepends on the evaluation of a number of factors. This must\nnecessarily be coupled with an ever-increasing acceptance by\nnations that investment in collective security should in part\nbe substituted for expenditure on national security. Within\nthese parameters, it is essential that nations make forces\navailable for peace-keeping purposes and ensure that they\nare adequately trained. Articles 43 and 45 of the Charter,\nwhich have never yet been applied, must be examined to see\nto what extent they respond to today\u2019s needs.\nThe concept of human rights has to continue to prevail\nin our discussions. Malta supports the proposal of having a\nUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights.\nWe consider the recent establishment of the\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former\nYugoslavia to be a pledge that heinous crimes against\nhumanity will not remain unpunished. However, we believe\nthat the establishment of an international criminal court with\njurisdiction to try crimes against humanity, war crimes,\ninternational terrorism and global traffic in narcotics will\nprovide an institutional concept for dealing with the\ninternational dimension of such offences.\nIn examining the institutional structure of the United\nNations, we are repeatedly struck by the continuing absence\nof a capacity within the system to deal globally and\ncomprehensively with the multiple issues of development.\nOver the last five decades the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions have played a major role in the areas of money\nand finance. However, a more significant relationship must\nbe built between the United Nations and these institutions.\nThe central capacity originally envisaged for the\nEconomic and Social Council to bring together the\nunderlying issues common to all the various facets of the\ndevelopment debate has remained equally elusive. This\napplies particularly with regard to entrenched disequilibrium,\nto the availability and allocation of financial resources, to\ntechnical assistance and to the far-reaching and often very\nsensitive aspects of sustainable development.\nWithin the context of the concept of a secondgeneration United Nations we have made a proposal to\nactivate further and give an added role to the Trusteeship\nCouncil. The Council has served the Organization in dealing\nwith Territories in its trust, most of which are today valid\nMembers of the United Nations. Its present diminished\nrelevance is in fact a reflection of its own success. Yet the\nconcept of trusteeship lies at the very core of the United\nNations.\nWe believe that the Trusteeship Council should hold in\ntrust for humanity areas affecting common concerns and\ncommon heritage. It could have a monitoring function on the\nprotection of the environment, extraterritorial zones, climate\nand - of paramount importance - the rights of future\ngenerations. These we hold in trust for humanity, and the\nTrusteeship Council can be the depositary.\nMalta has always seen its active involvement and\nparticipation at the regional level in Europe as an\nindispensable dimension of its role as a member of the\ninternational community. We have consistently defined our\nobjective of becoming a member of the European\nCommunity as a logical and natural culmination of our\nEuropean vocation. This definition is rooted in Malta\u2019s\npolitical, social and economic realities, as they have been\nshaped by our historical and cultural heritage.\nMalta has also consistently played an active role in the\nother European institutions which, together with the\nEuropean Community, have contributed to the formation of\na modern European consciousness. We see our role in the\nCouncil of Europe and in the CSCE as an expression and\nreinforcement of our deepest commitment to the dignity and\nfreedom of the individual in society. We attach equal\nimportance to the value of democratic principles and\nparliamentary practices, respect for sovereignty and mutual\nunderstanding between nations, respect for legality at both\nnational and international levels and the need for improved\ninternational cooperation relating to both security and\ndevelopment.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 15\nIt is only natural that Malta attaches relevance to the\nMediterranean region, a region suffering the turmoil of\nproblems in its midst. The importance of having its\nenvironment safeguarded, the relevance of its sea routes and\nits strategic role in linking three continents are all factors\nwith consequences which go far beyond the boundaries of\nthe region. Aware of this, Malta has shown continued\ninterest and involvement in promoting Mediterranean\ncooperation. We have supported the idea of a conference on\nsecurity and cooperation in the Mediterranean, and we have\nproposed the establishment of a council for the\nMediterranean to be a forum for political, economic and\nsocial dialogue for the region.\nIt was stimulating to hear President Clinton speak from\nthis podium of dreaming\n\\\"new dreams in this age when miracles seem possible\\\".\n(A/48/PV.4)\nWe all have our dreams for the future. Countries, large and\nsmall, rich and poor, dream of a future based on the\nbetterment of peoples, international solidarity, mutual\nunderstanding and peace - peace in freedom. We who have\nthe responsibility of guiding nations have to dream beyond\nthe confines of our States and start genuinely believing in\nthe brotherhood of man. We have to think that frontiers are\nnot barriers, but signposts leading to a break-up of longstanding prejudices and great divides.\nIn this age when miracles are possible, when man has\nconquered space, let us dream of yet other miracles: that the\n1.1 billion people living in extreme poverty will have their\ndaily bread; that the slaughter of the innocents, the tens of\nthousands of children dying every day because of\nmalnutrition and lack of adequate medicine, will stop; that\nthe millions of refugees who wander from camp to camp,\nuprooted from their milieu, will return to their homes; that\nthe billions and billions of dollars spent on weapons of\ndestruction will be dedicated to hospital research to\nsafeguard life; and that learning will be extended to all and\nthat the dignity of work will be denied to none.\nThese dreams of miracles can come true. They are not\njust dreams. The political will of the international\ncommunity and the dedication of many people to this cause\ncan turn dreams into reality.\nThis is our agenda for peace. We can turn it into an\nagenda for peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "Throughout the half century of\nits history the United Nations has never rallied a greater\nnumber of Member States and has never played a more\nprominent role in global and regional international relations,\nthan it does today, and it has never borne the brunt of such\nproblems as it bears today. This, the forty-eighth session of\nthe United Nations General Assembly, is being held in an\natmosphere of great hope and of even greater commitments\nfacing the Organization which, in this post-cold-war time,\nfollowing the historical collapse of communism and\nmultinational State communities in Europe, is becoming the\ncardinal guardian of global peace and security.\nThe fall of Soviet and other European Communist and\ntotalitarian systems has reinforced hope and provided the\nprerequisites for the comprehensive democratization of the\nworld while simultaneously raising the question of what kind\nof multilateralism is required and possible in the\ncontemporary world. Of no lesser importance is the question\nof the new role of the United Nations at a time when many\nnew States are coming into being and when the\nstrengthening of global peace is becoming the fundamental\nideology of mankind. The United Nations must shoulder the\nresponsibility for a more equitable global order to take hold\nin every corner of the world. But, in order to achieve this\ngoal, one must thoroughly review multilateral mechanisms\nas well as the activity of international organizations under\nconditions of the emergence of many new States, the end of\nbipolarity and the strengthening of the polycentric foundation\nof the world.\nThe process of disintegration of the Soviet communist\nsystem, which began with the fall of the Berlin Wall, led\ntowards a fundamental shift in relations, not only within\nEurope, but also on a global scale. It has redirected and\ndrafted new American-Russian and American-European\nrelations. The competitive wars of the great Powers bent on\ngaining influence and predominance in the Third World have\nalmost died away, but the focus of regional crises has now\nmoved to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and to the area\nof the former Soviet Union, because of the profound\npolitical, national, social and economic changes sweeping\nthose areas. International factors, primarily West European\nand North American countries, were taken unawares by the\ndepth and speed of these historical changes. Their initial\ndisorientation turned, subsequently, into a renewal of\ndormant traditional competition for spheres of influence in\nchanging circumstances. On the international scene, the\nultimate result has been disunity and the inefficiency of the\nmost responsible international factors in dealing with volatile\nregional crises, but such developments have also jeopardized\nthe European integration processes already under way. The\nfundamental values and goals of European regional\norganizations now face a serious test and a radical review of\ntheir mission. The new system of European collective\nsecurity is yet to take hold, and the same holds true for the\nsystem of general, global security. This is a matter of the\ngreatest importance because the security of small countries\nhas become the key to the stability of each region and of the\noverall international system.\nThe world has been slow to accept, and slower to\nunderstand, the changes involving the national and State\nemancipation of old and new European and Asian nations,\nand it has recognized their international identity with\nreluctance. The world has found it hard to grasp the at-first\nuntenable contradiction implied in the fact that we have\nentered a period, in the development of human society and\ninternational relations, of the broadest national\nindividualization based on a most comprehensive\ncivilizational integration. Even worse, the world has not\nbeen ready to face the difficulties and the temporarily\ndestabilizing consequences of such changes, which will\nultimately lead to the full democratization of international\nrelations.\nThe view that the collapse of communist systems and\nof Soviet domination over nations in the Soviet Union and\nEastern Europe had resolved the problem of regional and\ninternational stability was wrong. There was a similar lack\nof understanding of the fact that the process of internal and\ninternational democratization cannot stop at the mere\ndemocratization of political systems, and that it also\ninevitably leads to the disintegration of multinational State\nformations. This was the logical sequence of political\ndemocratization and national emancipation.\nThere can no longer be any doubt today about the fact\nthat the ever-increasing functional integration of the world\nwas the very prerequisite of national independence and\ninternal sociopolitical and international democratization.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7\nThis has only seemingly been a contradictory process.\nSpecifically, because of their endangered position, small\nnations and their States are anxious to preserve their own\nState, cultural and economic identity, and this sustains not\nonly the variety but also the very development of the world.\nIt should be remembered that positive nationalism, that is,\nthe national-democratic movement of oppressed nations in\nEastern Europe and of oppressed stateless nations in other\nparts of the world, deserves the greatest credit for the\ncollapse of the communist systems.\nHaving achieved their national sovereignty and the\nindependence of their State, small nations, in their own\ninterest, became supporters of \\\"civilizational\\\" integration and\ndemocratization. This is the reason why one of the most\nimportant goals of the international community today should\nbe the successful resolution of problems affecting complete\nregional and international integration of States having\nemerged after the disintegration of communist systems in\nformer multinational States such as the Soviet Union,\nYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\nThe new world order which is being created so\nlaboriously, but also of necessity, can no longer be based\nonly on the ascendancy of the anti-fascist coalition or of the\nnuclear Power club. Half a century after the historic victory\nover fascism, new economic and political realities have come\ninto being, and the countries against which the anti-fascist\nalliance was directed cannot bear the liability of the past\nindefinitely. Germany, Japan, Italy and the countries within\ntheir international political spheres during the Second World\nWar are today democratic countries with huge developmental\npower, which is also obviously beneficial to the world.\nSimilarly, the fundamental political and other eventful\nchanges taking place in Russia are transforming that country,\ncurrently in the throes of dramatic upheaval, from a former\nStalinist threat to international peace and order into, we\nhope, a constructive component of global order built on new\nfoundations of equality and partnership of nations and States\nfor the sake of mutual benefit and the stability of peace.\nThe balance of military blocs, weapons and ideologies\nestablished during the cold war was only seemingly a stable\nsystem, because it was actually founded on repression or\ndependency, first of all at the expense of small States or\nstateless nations. Today, to quote Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, \\\"Multilateralism is the democracy of\ninternational society.\\\" (The New York Times,\n20 August 1993, p. A29, \\\"Don\u2019t Make the U.N.\u2019s Hard Job\nHarder\\\")\nMultilateralism, certainly! But of what kind? We must\ntend towards a multilateralism that will help us - after a gory\nhistory of strife, first between dynasties, then between States\nand, finally, between imperialist or ideological-military blocs\n- to avoid war between incompatible civilizations. A brutal\nentanglement of these civilizational contrasts is taking place\nprecisely in the area of the former Yugoslavia, threatening\nto polarize greater areas along the lines of separation and\nconflict between civilizational-religious blocs. We should\ntend, instead, to internal, regional and global relations in\nwhich these civilizational spheres will blend productively\nand reinforce their identity through peaceful competition,\ninstead of wasting their precious potential on mutual\nconfrontation and annihilation.\nA new multilateralism capable of coping with the\nepoch-making changes of our time also calls for a thorough\nreform of the United Nations. This implies, primarily, the\nstrengthening of international law, but also the development\nof mechanisms which will help the United Nations and its\nagencies to function more effectively and to be depoliticized,\nless costly and more receptive to ideas, influences and\nsupervision.\nIn particular, the role and responsibility of the Security\nCouncil in dealing with questions concerning international\npeace and stability should be given greater emphasis. Over\npast years there has been considerable progress in the\noperation of the Security Council, and the use of the veto\nhas almost become obsolete. Nevertheless, certain Security\nCouncil decisions are still excessively influenced by the\nnational interests of its members, the permanent ones in\nparticular. Accordingly, we need a climate of cooperation\nin the Security Council that will prevent its being used as an\nextended instrument of the foreign policy of individual\nSecurity Council members.\nCroatia supports extension of the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council, which will reflect the\neconomic and political realities of the present-day world and\nassure a balanced regional representation in the Council.\nCroatia also endorses the limitation of the right and practice\nof veto. The major crises of our time, such as the one in the\narea of the former Yugoslavia, should be used as precious\nlessons for more effective and concerted action by the\nSecurity Council.\nWe also believe that a high degree of responsibility and\nauthority in decisions concerning the major directions of\nglobal economic and social development should also be\nvested in the Economic and Social Council, so that its\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ndecisions, in specific areas of decision-making, would have\nexecutive force similar to that of Security Council decisions.\nAlthough it would be difficult to envisage the General\nAssembly assuming the role of a global parliament to the\ndetriment of the sovereignty of Member States, a clearer\ndelimitation of authority among the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\nwould nevertheless be required. A more articulated link\nwith United Nations agencies, which ought to improve their\nefficiency and prevent the political blocking of certain\nprocesses, is also necessary. However, the enhanced role of\nthe Security Council, which we are advocating, should not\naffect the authority of the General Assembly, which is a\nforum for the manifestation of the views of the vast majority\nof small countries Members of the United Nations. As a\nform of present-day democracy, multilateralism should\nprovide the foundation for the stability of the new and, in\nevery respect, democratic world order. However, while\nstriving to turn our global Organization into a most\nconsonant orchestra which will provide for the full\nexpression of the voices of all differences and contrasts,\nnatural-permanent and secondary-provisional ones alike, we\nmust never lose sight of uncontroverted historical\nexperience - namely, that the role and, hence, the\nresponsibility, of the small and the greatest components and\nlines of force in international life are not and cannot be\nidentical throughout all events, times and circumstances.\nBecause of this we should continue to build global\norganization on the efficient activity of the Security Council\nand, within it, on the role and responsibility of its permanent\nmembers.\nThe central point with reference to the efficient role of\nthe Security Council, and of the entire United Nations, is the\nneed to develop a new foundation for peace mediation.\nEstablished in cold-war times, the mechanism was adjusted\nto the need to prevent the outbreak and spread of conflict\nbetween the blocs, or between their dependants in the third\nworld, with long-term freezing of conflict as the goal.\nToday peace mediation requires a much more active and\nflexible approach, first of all because of the need and\npossibility of preventive action, but also because of a\nselective use of force in the implementation of peace\nagreements and Security Council decisions. The example of\nmy country, the Republic of Croatia, and that of the\nneighbouring Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\npinpointed most exactly the two fundamental weaknesses of\nthe existing peace-keeping-force model and mandate. First,\nthe classic mandate, the freezing of the conflict by sustaining\na cease-fire, does not resolve the conflict but, rather, creates\nfurther complications. Second, as has become manifest,\ncertain countries whose forces are engaged in the\nimplementation of the multilateral peace mandate are trying,\nthrough the members of their peace-keeping units and\nnegotiation mediators, to pursue their national policies and\nnot the policy of the Security Council.\nThe reform of the overall peace-operation mechanism\nrequires, first and foremost, a more efficient use of\ncoordinated instruments of diplomatic, economic, political\nand military pressure and consistency in the implementation\nof the peace-keeping-force mandate. Such an approach,\nwhich also implies the selective use of force, not only could\nhave prevented the escalation of the conflict in the former\nYugoslavia but also reduced peace-keeping-forces\u2019 casualties\nto fewer than have actually been the case with the present\nstatic mandate, which does not offer adequate protection\neven to the peace-keeping force itself.\nIn recent years extensive positive, but also negative,\nexperience has been acquired in the conduct of\npeace-keeping operations in Croatia, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Somalia and Cambodia. It has been found that\npeace-keeping forces should be more qualified and better\ntrained and equipped for special missions in each peace-\nkeeping operation. The United Nations should also have\ngreater authority in the sensitive conduct of peace-keeping\noperations. This suggests the need for the establishment of\nalready well-trained and prepared national military\ncontingents to be available, with all their facilities, to the\nglobal community. Under the current system, in the best of\ncases several months are required for unit selection and the\nprovision of necessary facilities for the deployment of\npeace-keeping forces in specific areas, which results in\ndelayed action and substantially affects the conditions of\npeace-keeping-mandate implementation. It has also become\nevident that regional organizations, regional military\nalliances and systems in particular, can in the majority of\ncases be the main and most efficient mechanism to\nimplement peace-keeping operations. Peace-keeping\noperations are being used at an ever-increasing rate to\nprevent disastrous humanitarian situations or to alleviate their\nconsequences, but they will still have a role to play in\npolitical mediation and organization of the basic State\ninstitutions, as well as in supervising political and economic\nreconstruction in the initial period. Such United Nations\noperations of an increasingly more comprehensive scope call\nfor the cooperation of the entire international community in\nthe implementation of regularly highly complex missions.\nThe international community must act through the Security\nCouncil whenever there is obvious aggression against a\nMember State, as well as in cases where international\nsecurity is seriously threatened. Selective interventionism\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9\nmainly has an adverse effect on the reputation and credibility\nof the United Nations.\nEconomic sanctions are becoming, at an ever-increasing\nrate, an instrument of international pressure in the absence\nof political will to use stronger means to implement Security\nCouncil resolutions or to protect basic interests of Member\nStates and promote international law standards. In our view,\nsanctions can have an effect only if combined with other\ninstruments of international pressure and isolation.\nHowever, what is also required is a more efficient system of\ncompensating those countries which subsequently have to\nbear, with no guilt on their part, the burden of sanctions\nagainst specific regimes. A more effective system is also\nneeded to supervise the implementation of sanctions through\nthe enforcement of \\\"sanctions imposed for violations of\nsanctions\\\". In the opposite case, the sanctions, to be sure,\nwill have a long-term effect, but before the ultimate\nobjective is achieved the highest price will be paid by the\ninnocent population of the affected country, by people who\ncannot deal by themselves with the internationally censured\nregime.\nThe democratization of international relations and a new\nmultilateralism also imply a greater commitment of the\ninternational community to the safeguarding and respect of\nhuman rights, the punishment of the violators of\nhumanitarian and war law and the protection of the\necological balance of the planet. Although we uphold the\nview that the defence of cardinal rights and international law\nstandards cannot take precedence over the sovereignty of\nUnited Nations Member States, regimes and individuals that\nviolate such rights and standards may not be allowed to hide\nbehind the principle of \\\"non-interference with internal\nmatters of countries\\\". Balance should be sought in\nreconciling the two approaches, and the ways in which, and\nconditions under which, international mechanisms can be set\nin motion ought to be codified in the safeguarding of\nuniversal human rights and interests in order to preserve\npeace and the international order.\nBecause of its own experience - the orchestrated military\nrevolt of part of the Serbian population organized from\nBelgrade, resulting in the occupation of one quarter of\nCroatia\u2019s territory - the Republic of Croatia supports\ncooperation with the international community in the\nidentification and incorporation of the highest standards of\nprotection of the Serbian minority into Croatian legislation.\nWe accept international supervision of their implementation\nin the interest of inter-ethnic reconciliation,\nconfidence-building and the future stability of the country\nand the greater area.\nOf course, the responsibility which the United Nations\nshould assume at an ever-increasing rate in crisis areas,\nrelief operations, protection of the environment and\nassurance of balanced development, as well as in other\nissues of general interest, requires vast financial resources.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the regular budget and the\nfinancing of peace-keeping operations have assumed such\nkey importance among the matters to be discussed at this,\nthe forty-eighth, session of the General Assembly. Part of\nthese outlays can be reduced by a more economical use of\nexisting resources and by improving the efficiency of the\nUnited Nations system itself. We should prevent United\nNations actions from becoming an end in themselves, and\navenues should also be explored towards greater\nprogramming coordination with other organizations and\ninitiatives within the international system. Greater care\nought to be exercised in preventing all instances of abuse\nand corruption within the United Nations system, because\nthey not only increase the cost but also undermine the\nreputation of the global Organization.\nThe global community is saddled with many adversities\nand crises, but the international order is nevertheless\nbecoming more and more settled. We are encouraged by the\nfact that, after half a century of Israeli-Arab conflict, the\nway has finally been paved towards more stable peace in the\nMiddle East. This example can also be instructive with\nregard to the solution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.\nIt demonstrates the practical use and advantage of carefully\nworded agreements which are possible especially when their\nresolution actively involves the leading world power as well.\nSuch cases call on both sides for statesmanship and courage\nin making concessions for the sake of peace and require\nrealism in the assessment of national interests with regard to\nobjective international circumstances and the particular\nhistorical moment. The statesmen involved, and the\nresponsible officers of the global Organization, are expected\nto be reasonable and principled, determined but also\nmoderate, in a way allowing for no narrow-minded\nradicalism, but tending rather to seek the most favourable\nsolution for the protection of peace and the international\norder.\nWe are also encouraged to see that conditions are being\nestablished for the withdrawal of the peace-keeping forces\nfrom Cambodia early next year. This gives us hope that a\nsimilar process will also be completed in the Republic of\nCroatia in the immediate future, and in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in the nearest possible future.\nWe welcome the evident progress attained in the\ntransfer of power to the black majority in the South African\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nRepublic. We hope that the sporadic cases of racial and\npolitical violence in that country are only aftershocks\nfollowing the major political shifts towards racial tolerance\nand democratization of political life in that country. We are\nconvinced that the international community will also find the\nmeans to succeed in the already initiated and then halted\nprocess of political stabilization in Angola and Mozambique.\nWe also believe that resoluteness of the United Nations is\nalso required in the area of the former Yugoslavia, just as it\nhas been in Somalia, in terms of selective use of force,\nprotection of the peace force and assurance of relief. But in\nSomalia as well, the international community must also\nassume broader responsibilities in the restoration of the basic\nfunctions of the State and in the establishment of law and\norder in that country. It is obvious that differences in the\napproach to the solution of problems which frustrate the\nefficiency of the peace-keeping forces stem not from\noperative but from political reasons.\nThe Republic of Croatia welcomes the efforts of the\nConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the\nEuropean Community and the United Nations to mediate\npeace in the conflicts between or within the former Soviet\nrepublics, and we express our readiness to take part in these\npeace efforts. Fortified by its own experience, Croatia will\nbe ready, especially after the end of the war in the Republic,\nto contribute even more to the new mission of peace-keeping\noperations throughout the world.\nAs a country of outstanding natural attractions, but also\nof a very vulnerable environmental system, the Republic of\nCroatia will consistently implement the commitments of the\nAction Plan - Agenda 21 - the conclusions of the Conference\non the Environment and Development and the Rio\ndeclarations.\nCroatia believes that support of the programme of\nsustainable development is the proper way towards the\ngradual bridging of the growing developmental gap between\nthe North and the South, which is a permanent source of\npolitical and social instability and ecological imbalance in\nspecific areas and in the world as a whole.\nThe crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia is the\nmost difficult crisis in the world today, and it cannot be\nresolved without a more determined role on the part of the\ninternational community. Past mediation efforts have been\nshown to be insufficient because they were limited by a\nmandate lacking firmness, but also rendered more difficult\nby the diverse political interests of individual external forces.\nIt has not been sufficient to try to freeze the conflict, send\nin humanitarian aid and engage in empty threats, thus\nallowing the crisis to deteriorate to the point where\n\\\"everybody would get tired of waging war\\\" and then agree\nto a political settlement. The initial aggression of the\nYugoslav communist army, Serbia and Montenegro, for the\nconquest of Croat and Muslim territories was not countered\nby determined steps, and the consequences of such a policy\nhave been disastrous. They have included first and foremost\nthe terrible destruction and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in areas\nconquered by the Serbs, and then the extension of the\nconflict to the Muslim and Croat sides as well, the struggle\nfor the remaining territory, the incessant growth of the death\ntoll, and the ever swelling tide of refugees, which has now\nexceeded the figure of one million agonized men, women\nand children.\nIn the Republic of Croatia the United Nations\nProtection Force (UNPROFOR) mandate achieved certain\ninitial results in putting a stop to fighting and providing for\nthe withdrawal of the Yugoslav army. However, the\nmandate has been misused by the Serbian extremist\ninsurgents and their promoters, the Belgrade expansionists,\nto freeze territorial gains, continue \\\"ethnic cleansing,\\\" and\nconsolidate occupation which has assumed forms of\nterrorism even at the expense of the local Serbian\npopulation. The international community has allowed the\nSerbian side to completely ignore all Security Council\nresolutions and other agreements, in spite of the fact that the\nmodalities of resolving the conflict have been clearly and\nwell defined: complete cease-fire and the disarmament of\nSerbian paramilitary units; the return of all refugees and\ndisplaced persons to their homes; the normalization of traffic\nand supply; the guarantee of extensive ethnic rights to the\nSerbian minority within the scope of the territorial integrity\nand sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia; the gradual\nreinstatement of Croatian authorities and of law and order in\nthe occupied areas; confidence-building measures; scheduling\nof elections for local self-government authorities; and\ngeneral amnesty for all persons not found guilty of war\ncrimes.\nOwing to the lack of determination on the part of the\ninternational community in the implementation of the\nUNPROFOR mandate, the Republic of Croatia has found\nitself, through no fault of its own, in a position where\npressure is being brought to bear on it, including even\nthreats of sanctions, because it is trying to deal with its vital\ncommunications problems, or prevent Croatian towns from\nbeing shelled from areas under the protection of the\npeace-keeping forces. Thus, Croatia is being taken to task\nfor reinstating civilian traffic across the Maslenica Strait, on\nwhich a million people in southern Croatia and parts of\nBosnia and Herzegovina depend. Croatia is first urged to\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11\nnegotiate and normalize relations with Belgrade, and then\naccused of doing so. Meanwhile, nothing efficient is being\ndone to disarm Serbian paramilitary units and to prevent\nSerbian extremism and terrorism in the United Nations\nprotected areas.\nOne of the basic concepts of our policy has been the\nguarantee of the most comprehensive rights for all\nminorities - including of course the Serbian minority as a\nwhole, and particularly in the areas of Croatia in which the\nSerbs constituted a majority before the war - in the interest\nof the future permanent stability of the Croatian State and of\nits role within the international order. However, at the same\ntime the Serbian insurgents must provide for the return of\nhundreds of thousands of displaced Croats and other\nnon-Serbian citizens to their homes in the areas under the\nprotection of the peace-keeping forces. Belgrade must\nfinally recognize the Republic of Croatia and its borders, as\nthe whole world has already done. Croatia cannot tolerate\na situation in which the Serbian minority abuses its rights in\norder to break up the Croatian State or to create the legal\nframework for the secession of territories under local\nself-government and their annexation to the \\\"federation of\nSerbian lands\\\". This would mean the realization of the\nGreater Serbia idea, which was precisely the underlying\nmotive of the present war against Croatia and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro\nmust remain in force until peace is achieved in Croatia, too,\nand not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as is also provided\nfor by the respective Security Council resolutions. Croatia\nresolutely urges the consistent and effective implementation\nof all Security Council resolutions - no more, but no less\neither.\nCroatia has shown extreme patience within the scope of\nendeavours for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with the\nSerbian minority, orchestrated during the time the former\nsocialist Yugoslavia was disintegrating and the democratic\nState of Croatia was being established. However, Croatia\ncannot tolerate indefinitely the occupation of its territories,\nthe pressure of the hundreds of thousands of displaced\npersons from Croatian areas, and a situation in which the\nState is split. Croatia can no longer be forced to accept the\nfourth extension of the UNPROFOR mandate if the mission\nof the peace-keeping forces is not specified in more resolute\nterms, and if the Serbs are not given an ultimatum to\nimplement the Vance Plan and all relevant Security Council\nresolutions. The means used to bring about Serbian\nwithdrawal from Igman and Bjelasnica - military strikes -\nmust also be applied in Croatia.\nThe Republic of Croatia is not pleased with the latest\nreport of the United Nations Secretary-General, which\nsuggests the extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in\nCroatia by six months, with no essential changes in respect\nof the present mandate. If the UNPROFOR mandate is not\namended within the next 48 hours to ensure energetic\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions and other\ndocuments of the Security Council, the Republic of Croatia\nwill be forced to renounce the United Nations peace-keeping\noperation on its territory and to request units to abandon\nCroatia not later than 30 November 1993. Maintenance of\nthe status quo, which is nothing but the occupation of part\nof Croatian territory, and the inefficiency of UNPROFOR\nare detrimental to the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia\nand to the normalization of its economic and overall life.\nCroatia is prepared to resolve the key problem of its\nexistence by all necessary means and at any cost - by\nnegotiated agreement and settlement if possible, but, if\nnecessary, by resort to legitimate means of restoring law and\norder, with full observance of laws governing war and\nhumanitarian affairs, in areas currently suffering the anarchy\nof Serbian terrorist and paramilitary troops.\nWith its involvement in the area of the former\nYugoslavia, UNPROFOR has borne a great burden and has\nsuffered considerable casualties, operating in extremely\ndifficult circumstances. Croatia is grateful to all\nUNPROFOR members who have performed their duty\nbravely and honourably, risking their personal safety and\ntheir lives, and helping thousands of suffering people.\nCroatia does not oppose UNPROFOR, but it can no longer\ntolerate the consequences of the Force\u2019s inefficiency and its\npersistent circumventing of relevant Security Council\nresolutions. The implementation of these provisions will\naffect not only the existence of the Republic of Croatia but\nalso the basic credibility of the United Nations.\nBy renouncing the UNPROFOR mandate, Croatia does\nnot close its doors to any humanitarian action or to the\npossibility of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\noperation in the former Yugoslavia. On the contrary,\nCroatia welcomes the readiness of NATO to assume the role\nof principal guarantor of peace and stability in this part of\nEurope, and will actively support its units in the\nimplementation of the peace settlement. We also look\nforward to seeing NATO involved in the implementation of\nthe Vance plan. At the same time, Croatia\u2019s door is being\nopened wide to all relief and human rights organizations,\nEuropean Community monitors and UNPROFOR civilian\nlogistic personnel engaged in the provision of relief to the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nInternational factors - I refer to the European\nCommunity and the United Nations - have brought the\nnegotiations on resolutions of the crisis in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to the settlement currently proposed. It should\nbe remembered that the Republic of Croatia and the Croats\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to support all\nserious peace plans put forward by the international\ncommunity. However, the indecision and inconsistency of\nthe international community have allowed both the Serbian\nand the Muslim representatives to reject or to flout these\nplans. Even the proclamation of independence of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would have been\nimpossible without the agreement of the Croats, expressed\nthrough the 1992 referendum. Without the resistance put up\nby the Croats, no part of Bosnia and Herzegovina would\nhave been defended, in the beginning, from Serbian\naggression. We were the first to recognize the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and the first to send an ambassador\nto Sarajevo. The Republic of Croatia has contributed more\nto the defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to the care of\nBosnian refugees, than have all other countries combined,\nand that situation continues despite the aggression waged by\nthe Muslim army against Croatian populated areas in central\nBosnia and against territory envisaged for the Croatian\nRepublic within the Union of Republics of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nIn view of past developments, there are no longer any\ncompletely equitable and clear-cut solutions to the complex\nBosnian crisis. If peace is to be achieved, all the parties\nmust accept political and territorial compromise. The Croats\nin Bosnia have made major concessions for the sake of\npeace. They have lost the most, especially in Posavina and\nCentral Bosnia, where the majority of the Croatian\npopulation used to live. They have agreed to accept\n18 per cent of territory although the previous Vance-Owen\nplan envisaged a share of about 27 per cent. Indeed, for\nstrategic, political and psychological reasons, the Croatian\nside cannot agree to any further concessions.\nIt should be remembered that in 1948 the Croats\naccounted for 23.9 per cent of the Bosnian population. That\nproportion declined as a result of the pressure of the\nhegemonistic policies of the Serbs and then of the Muslims.\nIn the search for a solution, the same principles must be\napplied throughout. One might ask, for instance, why\nMostar, along with Sarajevo, is being singled out for\nEuropean Community supervision. Why not Banja Luka and\nZenica or Vare, where the Croatian population is struggling\nfor survival?\nWhat about the fact that, as a result of Serbian and then\nMuslim aggression, two thirds of Catholic parishes in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina have been occupied or completely cleansed\nof the Croats who lived there for centuries? The\ninternational community must face facts and problems in\ntheir entirety. It must identify ways of halting Serbian\naggression, but also means of protecting the Croatian people\nfrom the attempts of extremists to set up a Bosnian Islamic\nstate, mostly at the expense of the Croats.\nNevertheless, I am pleased to report, here and now, that\nhostilities between the Croat and Serbian sides in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina have stopped and, in particular, that, on my\ninitiative and with the good offices of Turkey, political\nagreement has been reached between the Croats and the\nMuslims concerning the cessation of hostilities and the\nprovision of the prerequisites for permanent peace and\ncooperation.\nWe believe that the purpose of peace would be served\nby NATO\u2019s energetic assumption of the chief role in\nimplementing the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand in solving the problem of the United Nations protected\nareas in Croatia, with the United Nations assuming\nresponsibility for implementation of the peace settlement.\nFor geopolitical, historical and economic reasons, as\nwell as for the sake of transport links, the Republic of\nCroatia is interested in the closest future cooperation with\nthe Union of Republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the\nsame token, the Republic of Croatia supports the\nnormalization of relations with all States that emerged\nfollowing the disintegration of Communist Yugoslavia, on\nthe basis of mutual recognition. This is not only in the\ninterests of the peoples of these States; it is also a\nprerequisite for the establishment of peace and for the\ncreation of a stable international order in this part of the\nworld.\n"

        "file_text": "This is the first occasion on which I have had the honour to\nappear before this lofty international body to speak on behalf\nof my country, Paraguay. I do so with the profound\nsatisfaction of representing a genuinely democratic\nGovernment that has emerged from free elections, and as the\nfirst civilian citizen who has held the presidency of the\nRepublic in 39 years.\nI wish to congratulate you, President Insanally. Your\nelection, based on your solid professional knowledge and\nyour long political career, is a tribute to you personally and\nto your country, Guyana, which you so worthily represent.\nI am pleased to recall in this context that Paraguay, since it\nentered the United Nations as a founding Member in 1945,\nhas always championed the right to the self-determination of\npeoples and the independence of political communities\nwhich, like Guyana, came to self-government in fulfilment\nof the obligations imposed by the Charter of the United\nNations.\nI welcome very warmly the new Members that have\njust been admitted: the Czech Republic, the Republic of\nSlovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\nEritrea, the Principality of Monaco, and Andorra. This\nwelcome is not simply a matter of protocol; it involves the\nrecognition of their respective Governments that I am\nexpressing on behalf of the Paraguayan Government.\nA little more than a month ago I inaugurated my\nGovernment with the firm resolve to strengthen our foreign\nrelations with all the members of the international\ncommunity, within the natural limitations set by domestic\nfinancial circumstances and contingencies. I would now\nventure to offer some thoughts for the consideration of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe new world order broke suddenly upon the world.\nThe bipolar structure of power has now ceased to exist, and\nthe change has taken place peacefully. Paraguay has\nchanged in the same way and with the same rhythm. Today\nthe Paraguayan people is the champion of its own destiny\nand the will of the people prevails. We live in a condition\nof respect for human rights, a market economy and State\nreform. We have successfully and peacefully carried out\nextraordinary reforms in the political, economic and social\nfields without external assistance, relying solely on our\ncitizens\u2019 faith and aspiration to live in peace, with justice\nand freedom.\n\nThe Government of Paraguay respects freedom and\npromotes justice; it is striving to widen the opportunities for\nhuman development and well-being.\nEconomic activity, and in particular the market\neconomy, cannot exist in an institutional vacuum. On the\ncontrary, a security system must be established that ensures\nthe fiscal integrity of all persons, individual initiative and the\ninviolability of private property, through a stable monetary\nsystem and efficient public services.\nThe priority of the Paraguayan Government is to\nguarantee this security, this stability and these services, so\nthat those who wish to work and produce can enjoy the\nfruits of their labour and feel motivated to do their work\nhonestly and efficiently.\nThe Paraguayan people is now aware that it has\ntriumphed over its many vicissitudes. We have heard many\npromises about the advent of the new man. We have\nwitnessed many tragedies and dashed hopes.\nToday, we believe that the only path towards the great\ntriumphs of collective well-being is that of democracy and\nfreedom. The men and women of Paraguay wish to live in\ntheir own way, respecting the law and prospering in\nharmony and concord.\nI would consider my activities of strengthening and\nconsolidating democracy incomplete if in future my\ncompatriots could not continue freely to form political\nparties and to elect governments without coercion, if they\ncould not live in peace with their families and enjoy the\nhonest fruits of their work, if they could not live fruitful\nlives and at the end of their days reflect proudly on their\nsuccesses and achievements.\nBut as we view the Paraguayan future, we must reflect\non a situation fraught with dramatic realities. We have\novercome a domestic political situation which for three\ndecades had been met with indifference, marginalization and,\nultimately, condemnation by the international community.\nWe endured that situation because of the labour the\ningenuity and the great sacrifice of the Paraguayan people.\nToday we must consolidate our victory and institutionalize\ndemocracy as the only possible choice.\nWe have run into two main obstacles to the attainment\nof that objective: an increasing rate of population growth\nand a lack of resources to finance our development with the\nrapidity required by the rapid increase in our population and\nthe pressing need to raise the standard of living and the\nwell-being of all Paraguayans.\nWe believe that we must be able to count on the\ncooperation of the industrialized countries in order to ensure\nthe continued primacy of the values we share with the\ncommunity of nations.\nTo accelerate our development we call for an extension\nof the magnificent collaboration of the United Nations\nsystem and its many institutions, such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, which now has a new, dynamic\nAdministrator and in which the developing countries place\ngreat hopes; the effective traditional programme of the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, which champions the rights\nof children and adolescents; and the United Nations Fund for\nPopulation Activities, which plays a very important role in\nregard to the crucial question of population.\nWe call also on the specialized agencies of the United\nNations system - each of which has in its field greatly\nassisted in our countries\u2019 development plans - to redouble\ntheir efforts, increase their effectiveness by means of greater\ncreativity, and lower their expenditures by exercising greater\ncontrol.\nThis cooperation should go hand in hand with domestic\nefforts to attract assistance on favourable terms and greater\nflows of private foreign investment.\nThe financial institutions, especially the World Bank\nand the Inter-American Development Bank, should speed up\ntheir assistance by reducing their bureaucracies and should\nprovide the fullest possible support to developing countries\u2019\nprojects and programmes. We recognize the great assistance\nthey have provided in the past, and we urge them to exceed\neven their past achievements in order to ensure a better\nfuture for all our countries. If the developing countries do\nnot receive such cooperation, the consequence will be, on the\none hand, a prosperous and democratic world with freedom\nand an abundance of goods for all and, on the other, a world\ncorroded by ignorance, poverty and the enslavement of the\npoor. It will be difficult for democracy to survive if poverty\npersists.\nEstablishing economic progress with equity in Paraguay\nmeans strengthening democracy. My greatest desire as Head\nof State is to establish the democratic system once and for\nall in my country.\nIn order to achieve that aim, my Government will act\nvery responsibly, ensuring that its administration does not\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3\nengage in irregularities, and it will be very strict in enforcing\nthe law. We wish to have the greatest possible transparency\nin the whole of the governmental process, in both domestic\nand international affairs.\nWe believe that the stability of democratic countries\nlies, among other things, in the integrity of their civil\nservants, in the independence of the judiciary, in individual\nand collective security, and in the State\u2019s efficiency in\npromoting development. That is why my Government will\npursue and punish anyone who engages in corruption. In\nthat way we intend to eradicate corruption.\nWe have undertaken to fulfil these purposes in the\ncertainty that the international community will be prepared\nto support us in so doing.\nNationalistic passions have flared up in many parts of\nthe world, challenging borders and jeopardizing international\ncoexistence. Age-old conflicts still seethe, as can be seen\nfrom the terrible bloodshed, and havoc in former Yugoslavia.\nThe United Nations has set up more peace-keeping missions\nin the last three years than it did in its first 45 years of\nexistence.\nAt the same time as we are witnessing these events\nwith distress and sorrow, we are rejoicing in the signing of\nthe statement of principles between the Government of Israel\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization. This valuable\ncontribution to world peace is due to the courage and the\nclear-sightedness of the leaders on both sides, who have\nbeen able to overcome the burden of ancestral prejudice to\nenter into a new harmonious relationship. We also applaud\nthe participation of countries as mediators in these\nnegotiations. They all deserve the world\u2019s admiration.\nMy Government believes that, in compliance with the\nSan Francisco Charter, the Organization will accept as\nMembers all those States that fulfil the requirements set out\nin the Charter.\nWe congratulate the United Nations on the tremendous\nwork that is being done in its peace missions. This\ndemonstrates not just that the Organization is alert to the\nneed to find a solution where any event may cause a breach\nof the peace but also that, in doing so, it tries to realize the\nhope of peace for suffering peoples, meeting their basic\nneeds and alleviating their difficulties.\nThe peace to which we aspire cannot come from sterile\nimmobility or from armed respite. It cannot be imposed. It\nmust be dynamic, sincere and generous and must be based\non the principles of solidarity between nations.\nLet me refer to a contribution from my country,\nreflected in our universal feeling of friendship. A few years\nago, in a small town called Pinasco, a doctor who was a\ndistinguished member of the community proposed that 30\nJuly be designated as a day dedicated to friendship. This\nidea spread throughout the Latin American continent and to\nother regions of the world. For this reason I am pleased to\nsuggest that the United Nations adopt that date as the world\nday of friendship.\nEvents are giving rise to a higher and higher level of\nworld and regional interdependence. With the Treaty on the\nIntegration of the Common Market in the Southern Cone,\nknown as MERCOSUR, we in the southern cone -\nArgentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - are seeking an\nimprovement in our economies.\nThe purpose of MERCOSUR is to harmonize\neconomies, to reach better and broader understandings with\nother economic groups through the provision of mutual\nfacilities. We hope that the negotiations that have begun\nwith the European Economic Community, the future North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the AsiaPacific countries will bear fruit.\nParaguay gives its fullest support to the creation of this\nCommon Market of the South. We hope fervently that there\nwill be frank and full cooperation in all the negotiations\nbetween the four countries involved. All our actions should\nbe really consistent with our aims. It is our sincere desire\nthat we may reach an understanding that is just and fair and\nof benefit to everyone.\nWhile dealing with economic affairs, I should like also\nto express our desire and hope that full agreement will be\nreached in the Uruguay Round negotiations. We hope that\nthe markets will open up increasingly. We wish to see trade\nflowing more freely, without any tariff or other barriers and\nwithout subsidies, which undermine the competitiveness of\nour MERCOSUR products.\nWe fully support the principle of free trade. One\ncannot hamper trade by protectionism while professing belief\nin the principle of free trade.\nI have just visited Bolivia, a sister country with which\nwe have signed joint agreements and I made an offer to its\nGovernment that Paraguay would serve as a link for its entry\ninto MERCOSUR. I also requested that they themselves, in\ntheir turn, shall serve as a link between MERCOSUR and\nthe Andean Pact. Through the system of MERCOSUR and\nthrough the Andean Pact, we have established a fresh and,\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwe hope, promising arrangement. Today - 29 September -\nwe commemorate the battle of Boquer\u00f3n, a symbol of the\nvalour of both peoples which we hope will be a landmark\nfor the future in our search for cooperation, understanding\nand peace.\nThis new era represents a challenge in relations\nbetween nations. In the process of the globalization of\neconomies, countries must avoid selfishness. They must\nshare their prosperity and technological advances in order to\nensure effective progress for all mankind. The European\nCommunity, the NAFTA countries and the Asia-Pacific\ncountries should be a dynamic force in economic relations,\nand should not set new limitations on world trade.\nInternational coexistence requires that we seek to\nestablish mutually supportive understandings and agreements\nthat will strengthen the collective economy and, thus, every\ncountry\u2019s individual economy.\nNorth America provides a very promising example of\nthis. Mexico, Canada and the United States are proposing\na zone of free trade between countries that have different\ncultures, histories, languages and lifestyles. In spite of these\ndifferences they have taken a praiseworthy decision to make\ntheir economies complementary.\nNAFTA represents an undertaking to ensure shared\nprosperity through collective arrangements. As we enter a\nnew century, these three countries realize that economic\nprosperity depends, as never before, on the opening of new\nmarkets across the world and increasing the volume of world\ntrade. We hope that when this arrangement is established it\nwill be of great benefit to the whole of Latin America and\nthe Caribbean.\nEconomic development should not run counter to the\npreservation and protection of the environment. Both\nconcepts are valid for everyone, irrespective of differences\nin countries\u2019 levels of economic development.\nEnvironmental degradation will continue if we keep on\napplying such ambiguous criteria as \\\"environmental\nconditionality\\\". The great meeting on the environment held\nat Rio in 1992, after very lengthy deliberations, points us in\nthe direction of \\\"sustainable development\\\" - development\nthat can be made compatible with protection of the\nenvironment.\nWe need to fulfil the agreement that was reached at\nRio. We must not go back on the commitments undertaken\nthere. Neither should there be double standards - different\nstandards for industrialized and for developing countries.\nThe latter need the cooperation that was promised at that\nmemorable international meeting.\nWith regard to social problems on a world scale, drug\ntrafficking threatens the economic and political stability of\nsome countries. In this area too the United Nations should\ntake the lead in order to combat the scourge of drugs, with\nall its disastrous consequences for young people and the\nmoney laundering and terrorism that are its ramifications.\nParaguay is totally committed to the battle against drug\ntrafficking, the money laundering resulting from it and all\nthe other crimes that are associated with drugs. This\nstruggle requires total international cooperation if drug\ntrafficking is to be eliminated. It has to be recognized that\nresponsibility for this undertaking must be shared by\nproducers, consumers and also intermediaries.\nThe United Nations is preparing for a conference in\n1995, which will be a special landmark in the whole of\ninternational coexistence. I refer to the World Summit for\nSocial Development that will be held in Copenhagen. The\nGovernment of Paraguay applauds this initiative and offers\nits fullest cooperation at the preparation stage and in the\nstudies. We are also willing to take an active part in the\nevent itself.\nInitiatives of this kind and the 1994 Cairo Conference\non Population and Development deserve our fullest support.\nAlthough, as I have said, the issues to which I referred\nearlier are of great significance to my country, I wish to\nmake the point that the raising of educational standards in\nmy country is my obsession. For this reason, we are trying\nto improve human resources so that we may make use of the\nnew technology which we sorely lack.\nEducation is not simply a commitment on the part of\nthe State; it is a challenge shared by all the productive\nsectors of the country. Technology may provide fresh\neconomic opportunities resulting in new sources of labour.\nThat is why Paraguay believes that the Bol\u00edvar\nProgramme is a good precedent for what can be done\nbetween countries determined to face the future by sharing\ntechnologies, innovations and industrial competitiveness.\nWe also hope that the industrialized countries, or those\nthat have achieved a high technological level, will show the\nnecessary will to promote the presence of their companies in\nour countries, so that their capital and new technology can\naccelerate progress in our developing countries.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5\nWe shall always stress the need for a more balanced\ntreatment of the social and economic issues on the\ninternational agenda. Attention must not be given to socalled new global issues at the expense of the problems of\ndevelopment, the struggle against poverty, the defeat of\nignorance, and the promotion of international cooperation.\nAfter 48 years, men and institutions are able to concede\ntheir mistakes and can strengthen their convictions in order\nbetter to achieve their purposes. The United Nations has\ndemonstrated such abilities by renewing and adapting itself\nto the demands of our changing world. Paraguay is in\nfavour of this and supports the necessary reforms to adapt\nthe Charter to the challenges of a new age. In this way will\nthe United Nations be able to live up to the high ideals and\nhopes with which it was created.\nTo that purpose, it is vital that it redistribute functions\nand responsibilities among its bodies, increase coordination\nand streamline its processes. The United Nations should be\nthe forum for the genuine expression of the aspirations of all\nMember States and the primary instrument for genuine and\npeaceful understanding among all peoples of the world.\nWe must confront and settle the financial crisis which\nweighs so heavily on our Organization. It is not logical to\nassign it tasks without providing adequate means to carry\nthem out. Let us avoid being moved by political motives to\ntransform that inadequacy into administrative negligence and\nfinancial paralysis. Let us do the opposite - let our\nOrganization be the great forum of the international scene.\nLet it be renewed, better, more effective and more equitable.\nWith timely intervention, the United Nations has\nbrought lengthy conflicts to an end and achieved their\nsettlement. This praiseworthy work must be recognized and\nif, in some cases, the success has not been great, that has\nbeen due to struggles between different power centres. But\ntoday we are all equally ready to work to achieve more\neffective disarmament and to establish new international\nstandards for the use of nuclear energy to benefit mankind\nand not to destroy it. We have made considerable progress\nbut there remains a long way to go before we have full and\ncomplete security in this area. Paraguay will support a\ndisarmament policy as a commitment to the international\ncommunity.\nWe continue to believe and have always maintained that\nthe United Nations should assume leadership, with the\nsupport of all Member States, in carrying out the necessary\nchanges to establish the rule of peace and the human\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\nMy country wishes to underscore the outstanding work\nof the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to\nexpress its appreciation for his activities aimed at making the\nUnited Nations and its entire system more efficient.\nParaguay has faith in these positive solutions. We\npledge to uphold the legal principles of international\ncoexistence and appeal to the loftiest sentiments and the\nhighest sense of responsibility of all leaders of the world.\nMy country believes that this can be achieved and urges that\nit be made a reality.\nNo more fratricidal wars. Let us all unite in the war\nagainst underdevelopment, against unemployment, and\nagainst ignorance, which is the worst of all slaveries.\nReiterating our commitment to full support for the\nUnited Nations, we also reaffirm our resolute cooperation\nwith the international community and express our deepest\ndesire for peace, prosperity and development for all the\npeoples of the world.\nI should like to conclude with a message in my native\nlanguage, Guaran\u00ed:\n\\\"Ja johayjh\u00fa, \u00f1a\u00f1o pytyv\u00f3, icat\u00fa haguaicha \u00f1as\u00e9\nt\u00e9nond\u00e9 o\u00f1ondivep\u00e1. Aguiy\u00e9vet\u00e9.\\\"\nThis means: \\\"Let us love one another, brothers. Let us help\neach other to move forward together\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Thailand, may I extend my\nwarmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nI am confident that you will provide the Assembly with the\nnecessary leadership and direction in this period of systemic\nchange in the international order.\nI also wish to congratulate Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria for having guided the forty-seventh session of the\nAssembly to a successful conclusion.\nAllow me also to express our admiration to and support\nfor Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his untiring\nefforts in guiding the United Nations through this period,\nwhen the Organization is being called upon to undertake\npeace-keeping activities around the globe on a scale\nunprecedented in its history. I also wish to congratulate him\non his vision, so lucidly expressed in his report, \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace.\\\" We look forward with anticipation to his\nforthcoming report on an agenda for development.\nIt is with great pleasure that we welcome, as full\nMembers of the United Nations, Andorra, the Czech\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, and the Slovak Republic. We sincerely believe\nthat these States\u2019 assumption of their rightful places in the\nfamily of nations will further strengthen the universal\ncharacter of the United Nations.\nBefore proceeding further, may I, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Thailand, convey profound\nsympathy to and express solidarity with the Government and\nthe people of India following the massive destruction and\nloss of life that resulted from the devastating earthquake last\nweek.\nWith the end of the cold war, a new spirit of friendly\ncooperation prevails in South-East Asia. The international\nsettlement of the Cambodian problem means that, for the\nfirst time in recent memory, the region is free of major\narmed conflict. With a view to constructing a new regional\norder of peace, harmony and prosperity, we the countries of\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\nseeking to intensify various cooperative efforts among\nourselves and with our neighbours and our friends outside\nthe region.\nASEAN was born in Bangkok more than 26 years ago,\nwhen the cold war was at its height. Now, at the end of the\ncold war, ASEAN has attained the political and economic\nstanding to play a greater role in the affairs of the region\nand beyond. Thailand will assume the ASEAN\nchairmanship this year, and it looks forward to working with\nall concerned, both within and outside the Association, to\nadvance the causes of peace and prosperity in South-East\nAsia.\nAs the ASEAN member geographically closest to the\nrest of South-East Asia, Thailand is in a unique position to\nserve as a bridge to our non-ASEAN neighbours. Thus, my\nGovernment wholeheartedly welcomes the accession by the\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and\nCooperation, which sets the broad framework for enhanced\ncooperation in South-East Asia. We earnestly hope that the\nday is not too distant when Laos and Viet Nam, together\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwith Cambodia, which is on the path towards rejoining the\ninternational community, will become full members of\nASEAN.\nIn seizing the opportunity to help to forge a new\nregional order of cooperative peace and common prosperity,\nASEAN is increasingly appreciative of the function of\nmultilateral diplomacy - particularly the enhanced\ncooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations.\nFor well over a decade, Cambodia has commanded the\nattention of the world. ASEAN and the United Nations have\nbeen working closely with each other to secure a durable\npolitical settlement of the Cambodian problem. In\nCambodia, the United Nations has just undertaken one of the\nmost comprehensive peace-keeping operations in its history.\nThe Organization - essentially through the United Nations\nTransition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) - must be\ncongratulated for organizing the massive repatriation of\nCambodian refugees from neighbouring Thailand and the\ncrucial elections that resulted in the creation of a\ndemocratically elected majority Government in Cambodia,\nthus enhancing the prospect of national reconciliation. I\nshould like to express my Government\u2019s appreciation to Mr.\nYasushi Akashi, to his colleagues and to the men and\nwomen of UNTAC for successfully fulfilling their mission\nof helping to restore peace to Cambodia. Above all, our\nwarmest congratulations go to the courageous Cambodian\npeople themselves and, in particular, to His Majesty\nSamdech Norodom Sihanouk for his vital role in the\nrestoration of the Cambodian nation.\nBesides facilitating the return of more than 300,000\nCambodians to their homeland, Thailand had cooperated\nwith the United Nations from the outset. We participated in\nthe mine-clearing and road-building operations in western\nCambodia, and, as I speak, Thailand is working closely with\nUNTAC in implementing the withdrawal of the remaining\nUNTAC personnel. Thailand will continue to participate in\nthe international community\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate\nCambodia. To this end, we welcome the success of the\nInternational Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia\nthat was held in Paris in September this year. With the\nreturn of peace and normality to Cambodia, we are confident\nthat the country will resume its rightful place in the South-\nEast Asian family of nations. Thailand pledges its friendship\nand cooperation to the newly elected Government of\nCambodia as it embarks on the path of nation-building.\nIn the post-cold-war world, the changing concept of\nsecurity provides further impetus for the regional role of the\nUnited Nations. In the present era, security is defined in far\nbroader terms than in the past. In particular, the\nnon-military aspect of security has assumed greater urgency\nthan, and now takes precedence over, its military dimension.\nIt is now seen more as a confidence-building process than as\na process of either defence or deterrence. Activities to\n\\\"reassure\\\" other parties, political dialogue and similar\narrangements to engender and enhance mutual understanding,\nmutually beneficial collaborative efforts to solve common\nproblems, crisis-management mechanisms and other\npreventive measures could all be subsumed under the\nheading of security.\nSuch a concept of security, particularly at the regional\nlevel, fits in well with the preventive-diplomacy approach.\nThis is one area in which there is potential for the United\nNations to define its role as being to strengthen and facilitate\nregional cooperation and understanding.\nNaturally, all efforts in this regard must be undertaken\nwithin a multilateral framework. The collaborative agenda\nfor preventive diplomacy would include conflict forecasting,\nconflict avoidance or prevention, conflict management, and\nthe prevention of conflict escalation. In this regard, my\nGovernment welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s excellent and\ncomprehensive report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which\nrepresents new thinking and an innovative approach to\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations. Moreover, my\nGovernment is heartened by the enthusiasm that Member\nStates have shown for the report. Our next step must be full\nand speedy implementation of the recommendations put\nforward in the report, as well as those contained in various\nSecurity Council documents and in General Assembly\nresolution 47/120, which was adopted at the last session.\nA mature and self-confident ASEAN is in a singular\nposition to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United\nNations in South-East Asia - particularly in the areas of\npreventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and\npeace-building. In the aftermath of the cold war, the success\nof the United Nations depends very much on close\ncooperation with countries in target regions. Put simply, the\nUnited Nations needs all the help it can get. Regional\norganizations can help to identify potential conflicts and,\ntogether with the United Nations, contain them before they\nerupt. Cooperation between the United Nations and a\nregional organization with a solid track record - such as\nASEAN - can compensate for the weaknesses of any\norganization acting singly.\nTo explore how best the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) could act in accordance with the\nrecommendations contained in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\",\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 11\nThailand has initiated and organized, in collaboration with\nour ASEAN partner Singapore, a series of international\nworkshops on ASEAN-United Nations cooperation for peace\nand preventive diplomacy.\nThe rationale behind this initiative is simple enough.\nThe threat to international peace, actual or potential, often\narises out of a certain specific region. With cold-war\nconstraints on United Nations regional intervention removed,\nthe Organization is in an ideal position to cooperate with\nASEAN to ensure peace and stability in South-East Asia.\nThe foundation for such cooperation already exists.\nThe ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East\nAsia forms the basis for a new code of conduct in the region\nand was endorsed by the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nOther factors may also favour United Nations\npreventive diplomacy in South-East Asia. One of these is\nthe regional presence of the major Powers. Under certain\ncircumstances, the United Nations provides a framework for\naction by major Powers. A case in point is Japan\u2019s\npeace-keeping role in the region under the United Nations\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia. Arrangements could\nthus be made for these nations to play a \\\"legitimate\\\"\ncrisis-prevention role involving, for example, political\ndialogue and mediation. Similarly, the regional economic\ndevelopment imperative may add impetus to United Nations\nregional involvement. The Organization has long been in\nplace in South-East Asia in this regard. Its development\ncommitments to and development efforts in the region have\nbeen evident in the location there of various United Nations\nregional bodies.\nThe next step will be to work out specific functional\narrangements for ASEAN-United Nations cooperation. It is\nanticipated that the third and final workshop, to be held in\nBangkok in January 1994, will come up with suggestions on\nappropriate mechanisms for fostering the conditions for\nregional peace and prosperity through closer cooperation\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations.\nThe improved outlook for greater economic cooperation\nin the region is manifest in the enthusiasm for economic\nnetworking. Within ASEAN we have set up the ASEAN\nFree Trade Area (AFTA) to intensify intra-ASEAN\neconomic cooperation and attract outside investment. The\ncountries of South-East Asia are taking up the challenge of\nforging economic linkages through various schemes known\nas \\\"growth triangles\\\", \\\"growth quadrangles\\\" and \\\"special\neconomic zones\\\". These linkages will help further promote\nthe spirit of friendship and cooperation and serve to provide\na nucleus for greater interaction with other parts of the\nworld.\nA livable world is a world in which governmental\ndevelopment strategies can be implemented in a favourable\ninternational environment. The international economy must\nprovide a supportive climate for achieving environment and\ndevelopment goals. Among others, we must further pursue\nthe liberalization of global trade policies, promote the\nefficient allocation of the world\u2019s resources, make trade and\nenvironment mutually compatible, and provide adequate\nfinancial and technical resources to developing countries.\nThese measures are prerequisites for creating a more\nprosperous world, where countries share their wealth in a\nliberal trading system and where fair competition is\nguaranteed by broadly accepted rules. For this reason, my\nGovernment believes that an early and successful conclusion\nof the Uruguay Round is imperative to revitalizing world\ntrade. Thailand joins our ASEAN partners in welcoming the\nrenewed determination and commitment of the industrialized\ncountries at the recent Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo to\nresolve remaining problems and to conclude the Round by\nthe end of this year.\nBalanced world development is not only an enlightened\naim, it is the foundation for the enduring progress of all\nsocieties. And this should be the basis for reactivating\nNorth-South cooperation. It should mark a new beginning\nin international development cooperation based on the\nprinciple of the Cartagena commitments. It must go beyond\naid to embrace partnership and reciprocal responsibilities. It\nmust address global and regional concerns by meeting local\nneeds.\nThe global consensus reached at the Earth Summit in\nRio de Janeiro last year has equipped us to take collective\naction to meet new priorities. We have built the consensus\nto pursue development which goes beyond economic growth.\nIt is development in a comprehensive sense, guided by\nprinciples of equality and justice, and underpinned by social\nand ecological responsibility. As we, the leaders, proclaim\nchange, we must demonstrate our political conviction\nthrough national policies that are in line with the\ninternational consensus.\nMy Government is fully committed to the\nimplementation of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED) agreement. Our\nnational development plan for 1992 to 1996 reflects our\ndetermination to achieve sustainable development. My\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nGovernment has taken various necessary administrative and\nlegal steps to integrate the environment with development\nand to implement the programme of action as reflected in\nAgenda 21.\nAs my Government is the first elected Government\nfollowing the May incident of 1992, we are more keenly\naware of the intimate links between democracy,\ndevelopment, and human rights. Hence, democratization\nmust be accompanied by sustained efforts to further the\ncause of human dignity and freedom.\nForty-five years ago, Thailand joined the international\ncommunity in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Since then, the international community has\nachieved a number of positive results in the protection and\npromotion of human rights.\nFrom the time of the first International Conference on\nHuman Rights in Teheran in 1968, the international\ncommunity has assumed new responsibilities not only to\nprotect but also to promote human rights. The time has\ncome to work on the prevention of human rights abuses.\nLast June, the World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna concluded with a consensus document. The Vienna\nDeclaration brings together views on fundamental rights, and\nserves as a universal basis from which the international\ncommunity will proceed. Thailand reaffirms its commitment\nto and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\nas set out in the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action.\nThe task before us now is to implement the\nrecommendations of the Conference. In this regard, the\nUnited Nations has a central role to play. The Organization,\nwith the collective efforts of its Member States, must\nstrengthen the mechanisms for allocating sufficient human\nand financial resources to carry out the activities required of\nit.\nBefore I conclude, may I emphasize that Thailand has\nbeen fortunate enough to have the benefit of the guidance\nand wisdom of their Majesties the King and Queen in all\nspheres of national life. Indeed, our monarchy has been the\nsymbol of national unity, a beacon of hope and the ultimate\nsource of strength in the hearts of all Thai people.\nMr. President, let me conclude my statement by\nwishing you every success in your new responsibilities. You\nhave a long and important session of the General Assembly\nahead of you. I have no doubt that you will fulfil your\nresponsibilities with great dignity and distinction.\n"

        "file_text": "For me this is a very special occasion, for it is the\nfirst time I address, on behalf of my father, the Sovereign\nPrince of Monaco, and on behalf of my country, this\nprestigious world Assembly of the States Members of the\nUnited Nations.\nI wish to tell members of the tremendous joy of all\nMon\u00e9gasques and inhabitants of the Principality of Monaco\nwhen my country joined this great world Organization. I\nshould like to take the opportunity once again to thank the\nmembers of the Security Council and of the General\nAssembly for their favourable consideration of Monaco\u2019s\napplication for membership of the Organization.\nI wish the Assembly every success in its work. A\nnumber of its agenda items are of particularly vital historic\nand political significance. The decisions we take will\nundoubtedly have far-reaching and long-term consequences\nfor the future of the world community.\nI wish also, to congratulate you, Sir, very sincerely and\nwarmly on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. My congratulations also go to the members of\nthe General Committee. I have no doubt that your skill and\nlengthy experience will enable our work to proceed under\nthe best possible conditions.\nLike all countries that put their trust in international law\nand cooperation, the Principality of Monaco, in its relations\nwith other countries, has always relied on respect for\ninternational norms and documents.\nIts Princes have always been fully aware of the fact that\nthe maintenance of peace necessarily entails respect for the\nsovereignty of States and the development of friendly\nrelations among peoples.\nPrince Albert I of Monaco, when he created the Peace\nInstitute at the end of the last century, was even then\ninspired by that philosophy, which led to the founding, in\n1919, of the League of Nations and, in 1945, of the United\nNations. On 5 February 1934 Prince Albert\u2019s successor -\nPrince Louis II, who was profoundly touched by the\nhardship and suffering caused by the First World War - set\nup the Medical-Legal Commission of Monaco, whose sober\nreflection and work which continue today, gave inspiration\nto the drawing up of the 1949 Geneva Conventions of the\nInternational Red Cross.\nMy country\u2019s commitment to peace is therefore a\ntradition of more than 100 years - a tradition observed by its\nPrinces, whose dynasty will shortly celebrate its 700th\nanniversary. It is also a political aspiration that has only\ngrown in strength with the passage of time. It will always\nbe adhered to with both conviction and determination in the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.\nIn this spirit, I should like to refer in particular to a\nresolution of the International Olympic Committee, of which\nI am a member, which unanimously recommends observance\nof a long-standing tradition of the Olympic movement - the\nprinciple of the Olympic truce.\nThe Government of Monaco supports this initiative,\nwhich was signed and endorsed by the National Committees\nof 184 countries and was officially addressed to our\nSecretary-General on 9 February this year. An international\nyear of sport and the Olympic spirit would undoubtedly\nafford an opportunity to launch this project.\nPerhaps it is by constantly repeating certain initiatives\nof this nature - albeit modest ones - that we shall be able\ngradually to create the just and lasting peace to which we all\nso deeply aspire.\nDid we not, a few days ago, receive from the southern\nshores of the Mediterranean news giving us immense hope\nof peace? Though it may be tenuous, we are at one with\nthose who inspired it and with those who are today\nendeavouring to make it a success. It is our earnest wish\nthat they will succeed.\nPeace is not just the silence of guns. Indeed, there can\nbe no doubt that the establishment of genuine peace can flow\nonly from greater respect for justice, human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. For this very reason, the work and\nthe conclusions of the Vienna Conference on human rights\nwarrants our very close scrutiny.\nFinally, echoing a wish expressed by my father,\nPrince Rainier III, when he addressed the Earth Summit in\nRio de Janeiro, I should like to emphasize that the\nGovernment of Monaco has set for itself the priority of\nprotecting our environment, both natural and cultural, so that\nit may provide a healthy, enriching and balanced life for all.\nThe Principality has undertaken major efforts to combat, in\nparticular, all types of pollution that attack and contaminate\nthe Mediterranean.\nMy country is more than ever resolved to encourage all\ninitiatives in this area, including the establishment, on its\nown soil, of institutions dealing with coordination and the\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nadoption of a General Assembly resolution that would\nproclaim 1998 the international year of the seas and oceans.\nI should like, in conclusion, to reiterate that the\nPrincipality of Monaco - in full respect for the rule of law\nin domestic affairs and for treaties and law in the\ninternational order; having neither armed forces nor military\narsenals; and bearing no enmity to anyone at all - is fully\nprepared to assist the Organization in all its actions,\nundertaken sometimes with great difficulty, aimed at\nmaintaining and rebuilding peace.\n"

As you assume your important\ntask, it is my pleasure also to wish you success in carrying\nout your duties and to assure you of my delegation\u2019s full\ncooperation with you in making the work of this session a\nsuccess.\nI take this opportunity to convey thanks and\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\nconducted the proceedings of the last session with skill and\nefficiency.\nIt is also my pleasure to mention with great\nappreciation the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to further the\nobjectives of the United Nations and his tireless drive to\nenhance the Organization\u2019s role in maintaining international\npeace and security.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend our\nwarmest congratulations to the delegations of the Slovak\nRepublic, the Czech Republic, the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco\nand the Principality of Andorra on their accession to the\nmembership of the United Nations.\nBecause of the important issues on our agenda, this\nsession of the General Assembly is a significant one indeed.\nThese issues under consideration demand close attention, if\nwe are to benefit from the object lessons of the past in\nformulating future parameters, as is required by the\never-accelerating changes in the international arena. As we\nlook at the historical events, that have followed upon one\nanother, we find that the world is in the midst of a\nqualitative transformation that is virtually unprecedented. If\nwe examine the causes and aspects of that transformation,\nwe shall find that the conflict that raged between the eastern\nand the western blocs was no mere ideological dispute\narticulated in academic forums. Rather, it was a violent\npolitical type of rivalry that escalated into grave military\nconfrontations that were, at times, direct and at others,\nindirect, between the super-Powers. The past few years,\nhowever, have witnessed the end of that conflict, and this in\nturn has entailed major changes in the political outlook of\nvarious world Powers.\nIt is regrettable indeed that, in the midst of these\nchanges, new problems have surfaced and have thus\nstrengthened our conviction that the ending of the cold war\nwill not make the world a more secure and stable place. For\nall its conflicts and tensions the cold war, when it ended,\ncontrary to all expectations has brought to the surface the\nbanes of extreme nationalism and such aberrations as \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\", things which had been dormant in Eastern\nEurope and Central Asia.\nThis has led, in certain regions, to acts of violence that\nthreaten to change the very nature of relations between\nStates at a time when the path of international politics has\nbecome really bumpy as a result of the restructuring of the\nworld order. This is a time of profound change in the lives\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 5\nof States and nations in which people\u2019s aspirations after\nstability and development merge with the fears generated by\nthe gap between a developed, affluent world and a world\nthat is unable to meet the minimum requirements of decent\nliving.\nThe major transformations that are taking place today,\nin the areas of politics, technology and information,\nunderscore the fact that our world has become a truly global\nvillage and that the scientific revolution is about to bring\ndown the barriers and boundaries between its various\ncountries and regions. It is regrettable indeed, at such a\njuncture, that while we stand on the threshold of a new\ncentury of man\u2019s history, we perceive that the interests of\nhumanity lag behind the advances made by science and\ntechnology. It is paradoxical indeed that the increased\ninterdependence dictated by the developments that are taking\nplace at the present time should go hand in hand with\npolitical fragmentation and clash of interests as individual\nStates pursue their own narrow interests and ambitions.\nSuch a situation should urge us to look at what is going\non around us with a large magnifying glass so that we may\nbe able to fathom the depths of international problems and\nscrutinize their interlocking strands on the wider screen of\nthe global scene. If we take the measure of the rapid\nchanges in the international arena, we may be able to foresee\nthe enormity of the dangers that the future may bring and\nthe extent of the harm to peoples\u2019 security and stability that\nmay result therefrom. For, in a world whose spaces and\ndistances have shrunk and whose different parts have come\ncloser together more than at any other time before, peace\ncannot be achieved in one region while the peace of another\nregion is left at the mercy of tensions. It is therefore\nincumbent upon us all to develop a practical strategy for the\nfuture through a new outlook that would be capable of\ngrasping and understanding the nature and drift of the\nchanges and harnessing them in the service of humanity as\na whole and for the strengthening of security throughout the\nworld.\nAfter this introduction, which reflects the way we see\nthe past and look at the present, my delegation should like\nto share with you certain thoughts on the building of the\npost-cold-war world:\nFirstly: there should be agreement on new concepts\nconcerning the issues of world peace and development\nthat would rid the world of the residues and perceptions\nof the ideological and strategic thinking that prevailed\nthroughout the cold-war period;\nSecondly: appropriate criteria should be defined for the\nachievement of world stability through the common\nsecurity of all States;\nThirdly: existing and traditional boundaries between\nStates should be respected, and all boundary disputes\nshould be resolved by peaceful means that are agreed\nupon by the parties concerned; and\nFourthly: there should be support for the United\nNations, as the appropriate international tool for the\nestablishment of a new international order where\njustice, equality, respect for international resolutions\nand the abandonment of double standards prevail.\nWar and peace are inseparable opposites. Given this\nperspective, the most difficult task in international politics is\nto devise an effective machinery to prevent the causes of\nwar on the one hand, and to preserve, maintain or keep the\npeace, on the other. It is our conviction that current\ninternational developments have created favourable\nconditions for making use of the United Nations potential to\ncreate a political climate that would be favourable for\ndeveloping the foundations of a collective security system.\nHere it should be pointed out that one of the most\nimportant means suggested for promoting collective security\nis the use of preventive diplomacy to prevent disputes from\narising between parties and to prevent existing disputes from\nescalating, and the development of preventive deployment of\nUnited Nations forces in such a way as to allow those forces\nto defuse potential tensions in any region of the world. We\nhope that Member States will reach a consensus on the\nformation of such forces, and that cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations can be enhanced\nso that the regional organizations\u2019 experience and their\nhuman and material resources in the field of peace-keeping\ncan be tapped.\nIn this context, I applaud the current cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab States\nand emphasize the importance of enhancing and\nstrengthening the existing relations between the two\norganizations in all fields.\nThe United Nations now approaches its fiftieth\nanniversary. The peoples of the world, with their hopes and\naspirations, continue to look to the Organization to lead the\nway to the turning of a new leaf in the history of\ninternational relations so that they can finally enjoy the\nsecurity, peace and stability for which they have long\nyearned.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe world Organization has managed, since its\nbeginnings, to achieve some of the purposes of the Charter,\nbut has failed to achieve others. It is now at a juncture\nwhere new hopes, accompanied by new problems, have\narisen. Over the last five decades, the membership of the\nOrganization has risen from 51 States in 1954 to 184 in\n1993. This calls for restructuring the Organization\u2019s\nprincipal organs, especially the Secretariat and the Security\nCouncil. We welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s statement, in\nhis Agenda for Peace, that important steps have been taken\nto reorganize the Secretariat in order to avoid duplication\nand overlapping of functions and to enhance its\neffectiveness. We call for further reforms to be effected,\nmethodically, so that the Secretariat can perform its duties to\nthe optimum.\nAs for the Security Council and its role in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the\ndevelopment of this important organ and the review of the\nprovisions relating to its membership have recently been the\nobject of world attention. Consequently, the General\nAssembly has included in the agenda of its forty-eighth\nsession an item entitled \\\"Question of equitable representation\non and increase in the membership of the Security Council\\\".\nThe inclusion of this item has taken place in response\nto the desire of many States to emphasize the importance of\nadequate and equitable representation in the membership of\nthis important organ in line with the increase in the\nmembership of the Organization and the glaring disparity\nbetween the composition of the Council and the membership\nof the United Nations. From 20 per cent in 1945, the\nproportion has dropped to 8 per cent now. We support the\ncall for a review of the composition of the Security Council\nthat would ensure equitable geographical representation.\nI should like, in this connection, to refer to the\nresolution adopted by the Arab League Council at its regular\nsession, held in Cairo from 19 through 21 September 1993,\nwhich calls upon the United Nations to take due\nconsideration of the need for equitable geographical\nrepresentation and to establish a permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council for the Arab Group.\nWe should like to stress that it is vitally important to\nensure that in adopting any of the proposed formulas for\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council, care\nmust be taken that this should not lead to impeding the\nproper functioning by the Council in carrying out its duties,\nand that the power of veto should not be used as a means of\nundermining the decision-making process or of diluting the\nurgent nature of critical issues, especially those which have\nto do with peace and security.\nIn recent weeks, a ray of hope that augurs well for the\nfuture of world peace has appeared on the horizon of the\nMiddle East and the world at large: namely, the accord\nsigned by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and\nIsrael. We have consistently encouraged any sign of\nmovement towards a peaceful, just and comprehensive\nsettlement of the Palestine question. There is firm hope\ntoday that this step will be a precursor to a real opening for\npeace and stability in the Middle East region.\nWhile we welcome this significant and historic step, we\nview it as a first step on the road to a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive solution to the Palestine question and the\nArab-Israeli conflict, based on Security Council resolutions\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other resolutions of\ninternational legality as well as the land-for-peace principle.\nWe hope that efforts will continue to be made towards the\nspeedy implementation of the provisions of the accord and\nthat the negotiations between other Arab parties and Israel\nwill make progress on the other tracks so that the existing\nopportunities for peace may be put to good use.\nWe look forward to the day when the Israeli forces will\nwithdraw from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, including\nHoly Jerusalem, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights and the\noccupied Lebanese and Jordanian territories, and to the day\nwhen the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding the right of return for the Palestinian refugees, will\nbe guaranteed, in consonance with relevant United Nations\nresolutions.\nIt should be emphasized that stability in the Middle\nEast is fully dependent on its being freed from chemical,\nbiological and nuclear weapons. Declaring the Middle East\na region free of weapons of mass destruction would enable\nits States to focus their attention on questions of economic,\nscientific and technological development and would\nencourage them to cooperate in the field of peaceful uses of\nnuclear energy and to make a constructive contribution to the\nmaintenance of world peace.\nTwo devastating wars have swept over the Gulf, and\ntheir consequences have adversely affected development in\nthe area. It behooves us, therefore, to intensify efforts to\nkeep that important area free of any further tensions, through\nthe settlement of disputes by peaceful means and through\nrespect for the principles of territorial integrity and political\nindependence, the sovereignty of States over their own\nresources, non-interference in the internal affairs of other\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 7\nStates and strict observance of the norms of international\nlegality.\nWe should like to emphasize the need for Iraq to\nimplement Security Council resolutions relevant to its\naggression against the State of Kuwait, and in particular the\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 687 (1991)\nrelating, inter alia, to the release of Kuwaiti and other\nprisoners of war and detainees, and to recognize the\ninternational boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq as\ndemarcated and set out in Security Council resolution\n833 (1993).\nWe also hope that the dialogue between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to\nthe settlement of all outstanding questions regarding the\nthree islands of Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb\nin a manner that would guarantee the rights of the United\nArab Emirates as set out in the resolutions of the Gulf States\nCooperation Council.\nThe international arena has witnessed some\ndevelopment, this year, in relation to the situation in\nSomalia. Although that situation continues to irk the\nconscience of the international community, the United\nNations has been able, through the efforts of a large number\nof its members, to restore peace in most parts of Somalia.\nSecurity Council resolution 814 (1993) has had a positive\neffect in improving the situation after the drawn out\nsuffering experienced by the people of that country. We\nshould like to voice support for United Nations efforts to\nrebuild the political, economic and social infrastructure of\nSomalia. We hope that the Somali people will be able to\nreach comprehensive national reconciliation between the\nvarious factions.\nThe world has been following the tragic situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Despite all the efforts deployed in\nan attempt to contain the conflict, we see no glimmer of\nhope that aggression against that country will cease. The\nSerbian side rejected the Vance-Owen peace plan, while the\nGovernment of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted it. Massacres\nand acts of aggression against Bosnian cities continue\nunabated, and the Serb forces have committed the most\natrocious crimes of genocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in open\ndefiance of the international community. Yet the Security\nCouncil has not taken any effective measure to suppress the\naggression or to enable the legitimate Bosnian Government\nto defend itself. That, surely, sends the wrong message to\nall those who do not believe in the system of international\ncollective security and could give rise to a surge of violence\nand extremism that would have an adverse effect on the\nUnited Nations endeavours to contain existing and potential\nconflicts in the world.\nThe international community is duty-bound to move\nurgently to stop the aggression against the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, to safeguard the legitimate rights\nof its people, to force the aggressors to comply with the\nprinciples of international legality, to prevent any\ndemographic change or any territorial gains through the\npolicy of fait accompli pursued by the Serbs and the Croats,\nand to enable the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to\nexercise the right of self-defence by lifting the embargo on\narms supplies to it.\nIt is regrettable, at a time when the features of a new\nworld order are beginning to take shape, that Central Asia\nshould be in the grip of a situation of instability that\nthreatens to tear it apart. Internal strife continues without let\nup in Tajikistan and Georgia and the war between Armenia\nand Azerbaijan has grown even more vicious. In this\nconnection, my delegation supports Security Council\nresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993), which reaffirm the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and of all\nother States in the region and the inadmissibility of the use\nof force for the acquisition of territory. We reaffirm our\nendorsement of the efforts made by the United Nations and\nregional organizations to restore stability in that region.\nFor years, the Cyprus problem has continued to defy\nsolution. We are encouraged, however, by the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to bring the two Cypriot parties closer to\nagreement. Despite the remaining obstacles that obstruct the\nsettlement of this problem, it is our view that the good\noffices of the Secretary-General should continue until a\nsolution that would be satisfactory to both parties may be\nreached.\nWith regard to the situation in Cambodia, positive\nresults have been achieved, and the United Nations, through\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\n(UNTAC), has been able to restore political stability to that\ncountry. We should like on this occasion to extend our\nsincere congratulations to the people and Government of\nCambodia on the outcome of their efforts in pursuit of\nnational reconciliation and peace. We also commend the\nconstructive efforts of UNTAC in carrying out its mandate\nin Cambodia.\nSouth Africa is now going through a significant and\ncrucial phase in its march towards political reform. The\nmain features of this reform are the agreement on the\ndrafting of a new constitution, the formation of a new\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ntransitional multi-party Government, and the agreement to\nhold constitutional elections in April 1994. These\ndevelopments demonstrate the sincere desire of all parties in\nSouth Africa to turn a new leaf in their relations. We\nsupport the reforms currently under way in South Africa and\nwelcome Nelson Mandela\u2019s call, in his recent address at the\nUnited Nations, for lifting the economic sanctions now in\nplace against South Africa.\nAlthough the fires of the cold war have been put out\nand have become something of the past, we cannot but voice\nour concern over the numerous difficulties which continue\nto beset the world economy. The gap is still wide between\nthe average per capita income in developing countries and\nthat in developed countries. In 1992, that figure was over\n$18,000 in the developed countries, while in the developing\ncountries it did not exceed $800. There are distressing\nindications that the rate of world economic growth lags\nbehind the rate of world population growth.\nThe continuing social deterioration and lack of\neconomic security which result from continuous political\nupheavals will undoubtedly impede economic development\nin the long term. So long as the world economy continues\nto stagnate, the urgent social problems connected with the\neconomy, in the areas of population, health, housing and\nenvironment, will continue to defy solution.\nAny change in the world economy, whether it be\nnegative or positive, affects every State. The world\neconomy stands in need of the political will that should lead\nall the States of the world, especially the developed\ncountries, to cooperate in solving those problems that face us\nall. This makes it incumbent upon us all to strengthen the\nrole of the United Nations, as the Organization that has\ncontinued for about half a century, to embrace the countries\nof the world with the distinctive and varied experiences each\nand every country has gained in the areas of developmental\ncoordination and cooperation.\nOver the past decades, the world has been focusing on\neconomic development owing to the immediate and speedy\nreturns it generates for the world economy. Voices have\nbeen raised in the United Nations, in recent years, urging\nthat attention should be paid to social development as well.\nThis has led to the adoption by the General Assembly of\nresolution 47/92, in which it decided to convene a World\nSummit for Social Development early in 1995. We hope\nthat those in charge of preparations for that conference will\nreach agreement to further those objectives of the Charter set\nout in Article 55, relating to the promotion of higher\nstandards of living, conditions of economic and social\nprogress and development as well as to the resolution of\ninternational economic and social problems.\nOur planet faces man-made environmental threats\nwhose consequences are unpredictable. The Earth Summit\nin Rio de Janeiro was an important step towards world\npartnership in combating those environmental threats. We\nshould like, in this context, to reiterate our support for the\nefforts to contain the threats to our environment, and we\nhope that the programmes adopted by the Rio Summit,\nespecially those included in Agenda 21, will be\nimplemented.\nThe attention focused on population problems stems\nfrom the tremendous density of population in some countries\nand the adverse effects that density has on development. We\nwelcome the efforts by the United Nations and particularly\nby the United Nations Population Fund, to address such\nissues. We hope that the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development scheduled to be held in Cairo\nnext year, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 47/176,\nwill adopt recommendations that may ensure the resolution\nof urgent population and development problems in the next\ndecade.\nSeveral years have passed since the world first\nwitnessed that novel, unique situation in the history of\ninternational relations, namely the ending of bipolarity. The\nresult of this is that the world now stands at the crossroads\nof history, where it faces difficult challenges. This is\nespecially so because certain evil tendencies have caused the\neruption of volcanoes of malevolent hatreds and racism,\nwhich have destroyed many hopes and shattered the\nexpectations of millions of people to achieve security and\nprosperity for future generations.\nIt may be appropriate to stop here and wonder whether\nthe United Nations has done all it should to address the\nproblems that have surfaced due to this major transformation\nin world order? Has the machinery which we and many\nothers have called for been made available to the world\nOrganization to enable it to fulfil its role in a manner that is\ncompatible with the developments of our time? Even if the\nUnited Nations has moved as we had hoped, have the\nMember States made available to it the material and moral\nresources to enable it to take effective action to address all\nof the world problems, wherever they may appear?\nWe do not believe anyone in today\u2019s world searches for\nthe Utopia described in Plato\u2019s Republic or Farabi\u2019s Ideal\nCity. Yet everyone would like to see the United Nations\nmade able to achieve practical solutions for world problems.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 9\nFor it is our conviction that any blood shed by a hand\nprompted by an ethnic bigotry or racial hatred would be a\nclear indication of our failure to respond to the aspirations\nof all our peoples.\nIt is in this context that we call for resorting to reason\nin trying to understand the new phenomena and to deal with\npolitical, economic and social problems in a rational and\ndispassionate manner. The time has come for issues relating\nto international and regional security and development to be\nput in their proper realistic perspectives, without any\nidealistic flights of fancy. Such problems should be dealt\nwith in the light of the objective realities of the world we\nlive in with all its successive developments, so that the\nsolutions devised for them may be applicable in the current\natmosphere of inter-State rivalries. We are confident that,\nwith political will, material support and moral\nencouragement, it will be possible for the United Nations to\nperform its role in steering the ship of hope towards the\nshores of security and peace we all seek.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first to take this opportunity to extend to the\ndelegation of India the sincerest condolences of the\ndelegation of Gabon on the earthquake that has just hit the\nregion of Sholapur.\nThe present session of the General Assembly is\nconvened at a crucial juncture in the history of international\nrelations. A number of significant events have occurred on\nthe world stage in the past few years.\nIn that context the election of Ambassador\nSamuel Insanally as President of the General Assembly is\nparticularly significant. It is a tribute not only to his\nqualities as an enlightened diplomatic, well versed in\ninternational questions, but to the tireless work of Guyana,\nhis country, on behalf of peace. On behalf of the delegation\nof Gabon, I extend to him our warmest congratulations on\nhis election to preside over this session.\nOur congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who discharged his duties so\nhonourably and ably.\nTo our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nI repeat our firm support for his many efforts on behalf of\nworld peace and security.\nLastly, we should like to welcome the new countries\nthat have just joined the great family of the United Nations\nand to assure them of our friendship and readiness to work\nwith them to achieve the noble purposes for the attainment\nof which the Organization was founded.\nThe end of the cold war has made it possible to\nestablish new kinds of relations between States and to open\nthe way to a new era of hope, peace and solidarity,\npromoting conflict prevention, better ways of dealing with\nacute problems and the settlement of many of the conflicts\nthreatening international peace and security.\nIt is from that perspective that we should view the\nrecent initiatives which the Organization and the\ninternational community have undertaken.\nGabon welcomes with great interest the most recent\npolitical developments in South Africa. We welcome the\ncreation of a Transitional Executive Council, which will\nallow South Africans for the first time to take part in\nbuilding a new, democratic, non-racial and united South\nAfrica. In that spirit, we urge all other parties to accede to\nthe agreement creating the Council and hope they will work\ntowards its full implementation. Gabon believes that the\nchanges taking place in South Africa will have a definite\nimpact on the democratization process in Africa and on the\ncontinent\u2019s development. We therefore hope that the appeal\nmade here on 24 September 1993 by President Nelson\nMandela for the lifting of economic sanctions and the\nestablishment of diplomatic relations with South Africa will\nbe heard and acted upon.\nIn Somalia too many innocent victims continue to pay\nthe heavy daily price of violence. While praising the efforts\nof the United Nations to bring peace and national\nreconciliation to the country, we believe that the time has\nperhaps come for the international community to give\npriority to the path of dialogue and negotiation.\nThe situation in Liberia remains a source of concern,\ndespite the hopes raised by the signing of the Cotonou\nAgreement on 25 July 1993. We call on the parties\nconcerned to begin strict implementation of that Agreement.\nWe make a similar appeal to the parties to the conflicts in\nMozambique, Rwanda and Angola.\nTurning specifically to Angola, I note that the optimism\nprevailing after the Bicesse Peace Accords soon gave way to\ndisappointment born of the resumption of hostilities. In that\nbrother country, so close to my own, the perpetuation of the\nsituation leads me to praise the tireless efforts of the United\nNations and all other initiatives aimed at restoring peace and\nsecurity. As in the past, Gabon will spare no efforts to help\nachieve a lasting settlement of that conflict.\nIn the Middle East the mutual recognition of Israel and\nthe PLO, as well as the recent signing of the interim\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\narrangements for the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho, were\nwelcomed with relief and deep satisfaction by my country.\nWe dare hope that this historic agreement will promote\nreconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\nthe establishment of a climate of peace and cooperation in\nthe region.\nIn that regard, my country supports all United Nations\ninitiatives, particularly Security Council resolution\n833 (1993), aimed at ensuring respect for the inviolability of\nthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait, in\naccordance with the terms of the 1963 arrangements.\nIn South-East Asia we welcome the decisive role\nplayed by the United Nations in the restoration of peace in\nCambodia. The holding of free and fair elections in\nMay 1993, the creation of the Constituent Assembly, and the\nreturn to the throne of His Royal Highness\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk all illustrate the United Nations\ncommitment and the confirmed solidarity of the international\ncommunity.\nThe tragedy unfolding in Bosnia and Herzegovina and\nthe serious threat of the conflict\u2019s spreading to the entire\nsubregion are a source of concern for my country. We make\nan urgent appeal to the parties concerned to return to the\nnegotiating table and lay down their arms.\nThe Conferences recently held in Vienna and Geneva\non human rights and the protection of the victims of war,\nrespectively, were opportunities for our Organization to\nreaffirm its commitment to defending human rights. Gabon,\nwhich has always given these questions their due\nconsideration, encourages all United Nations efforts to\nprotect human rights. It would thus be appropriate to\nstrengthen existing structures with additional human and\nfinancial resources so as to promote the efficiency sought by\nour Organization in this area.\nNever has our Organization been called on to such a\ndegree by the international community as in the past few\nyears. If it is to meet all the expectations, it must adapt its\nmain organs to the demands of the times. We welcome the\nongoing reform and revitalization process and hope that it\nwill include consideration of equitable representation in the\nSecurity Council and an increase in the number of its\nmembers.\nOne area which our Organization must explore further\nis that of preventive diplomacy, as set forth by the Secretary-\nGeneral in his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". Reflecting that\ntrend, the Organization of African Unity has just created\nmachinery to prevent, manage and settle conflicts. If it is to\nbe effective, this new machinery must be integrated into the\nframework of global disarmament.\nThe progress made by last 13 January, when the\nchemical-weapons Convention was signed, shows the\ninternational community\u2019s determination to ban weapons of\nmass destruction, particularly chemical weapons, and its\nreadiness to work for general and complete disarmament.\nFor its part, my country is working towards that end, just as\nit is promoting confidence-building measures in central\nAfrica. It was in keeping with this involvement that we\nhosted the third meeting of the Permanent Consultative\nCommittee on security questions in our subregion. This\nmeeting was notable for bringing together, for the first time,\nall States members of the Economic Community of Central\nAfrican States (ECCAS).\nIn the course of its work the Committee stressed the\nadvantages for all States of the subregion of ratifying\ninternational legal instruments on disarmament matters. It\nrecommended that its Bureau play a more committed\npolitical role in seeking solutions to crises and conflicts\nlikely to disturb the peace of a member State. It encouraged\nStates in the subregion to pursue and strengthen the\ndemocratization process already under way, while respecting\nand promoting human rights.\nRegarding the creation of a permanent inter-State crisis\nmanagement headquarters, with a view to establishing a\nsubregional peace-keeping force, the Committee\nrecommended transitional measures, including the\ninvolvement of ECCAS in the field of security; a study of\nfeatures and types of crises and conflicts; and the creation of\na non-permanent committee of subregional staff offices. It\nfurther recommended that the United Nations be asked for\nassistance to carry out a study on a balanced and gradual\nreduction of the armed forces, equipment and military\nbudgets of member States. Finally, the Committee adopted\na draft non-aggression pact between the ECCAS member\nStates and decided to submit it to Heads of State or\nGovernment of the subregion for signature. As\nrepresentative of the host country at these important\nmeetings, and on behalf of the States of the subregion, it is\nmy honour and privilege to invite the General Assembly in\ndue course to endorse the draft resolution, which will be\nsubmitted to it for consideration.\nWhat is truly at stake for Africa is essentially the\neconomy. It will determine to a great extent the preservation\nof unity, peace and security on our continent. In that regard,\nthe marginalization of Africa in the world economy - as a\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 41\nresult of the decline of its commodity prices, the reversal of\nfinancial resource flows from our countries to the\ninternational financial institutions, and the debt burden - has\nonly grown during the past five years.\nAlready experiencing such a restrictive economic\nenvironment, how can we in my country welcome the idea\nof an energy tax and not deplore the threat of a boycott of\nour forest products by ecological groups in the industrialized\ncountries? As to the forest, the Gabon authorities have\nalways favoured the long-term management of our forests,\nthrough a logical policy of reforestation conforming with the\nrecommendations of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development.\nMy country stresses the need to maintain every aspect\nof the Rio spirit aimed at managing world problems in a\nglobal manner, and to promote the emergence of a new\npartnership in international economic and financial relations.\nGabon considers this new approach to be a possible avenue\nfor the development of our countries.\nIn this connection, we would like to congratulate the\nJapanese authorities on their initiative in organizing the\nInternational Conference on African Development, scheduled\nto be held in Tokyo in October. We hope that Conference\nwill serve as the basis for a real and lasting partnership.\nIn this context, the proposal made by the President of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session in his\nopening address that we create an agenda for development\nshould enjoy the full support of our Organization.\nIn conclusion, turning to our country\u2019s development\nproblems, I feel that I must draw the attention of the\nAssembly to the decisive role to be played by women. Our\nOrganization has adopted resolutions and declarations on this\nsubject. The political commitment has been made, but it\nmust be associated with consistent follow-up measures to\nimplement these provisions. This is a struggle that we must\nall of us become involved in.\nAnxious to take into account the role of women in the\npolitical, economic, social and cultural fields, the Gabonese\nGovernment, through the Ministry responsible for the status\nof women, is working towards making this commitment a\nreality.\nThe sessions of the General Assembly are for Member\nStates an excellent opportunity to seek together ways and\nmeans of attaining the noble objectives of the Charter. Is\nnot one of its most important goals\n\\\"To achieve international cooperation in solving\ninternational problems of an economic, social, cultural,\nor humanitarian character\\\"?\n"

        "file_text": "May I at the outset\nextend to you, Sir, my own and my country\u2019s warmest\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Your\nassumption of the presidency is a singular honour for the\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). It marks the first\noccasion on which a person from that region has been\nelected to preside over the General Assembly. Your\npresence here in the Chair therefore provides added\nsignificance to the honour and privilege attached to the\nopportunity presented to my country, also a CARICOM\nState, to address this body. Knowing you as I do, Sir, I am\ncertain that your experience, wisdom and diplomatic skills\nwill guide our deliberations to successful and historic\nconclusions.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 17\nThe end of the cold war and the movement towards\ndemocratization within the former Soviet Union and in\nEastern Europe, accompanied by the new level of entente\nbetween the major Powers in the Security Council, have led\nto a new paramountcy of this Organization in the conduct of\nrelations between nations. Many of the essential principles\nof the Charter, too long suppressed in the presence of super-\nPower rivalries, are now given the opportunity, within this\nmore conducive environment, to assume the importance for\nwhich they were designed when first established as a product\nof the wisdom of the founding fathers of this Organization.\nThe tendency towards globalization in economic, if not\nin political, terms suggests an era within which consensus\nand mutuality of approach will be essential for furthering\nbalanced and sustained global advancement. The ideal of\nuniversality within the framework of this Organization\nbecomes even more important in this context. Now that the\ngrim obstacles which oppose the concepts of equality and\nuniversality are being dismantled in South Africa, we are\nhopeful that that country will soon be able to take its place\naround this hearth of the family of nations.\nIt was also in furtherance of the spirit of universality\nand its all-embracing purpose that Saint Lucia joined 11\nother Member States of the United Nations in proposing the\ninclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda aimed at\nobtaining General Assembly agreement for the establishment\nof an ad hoc committee to study the situation of the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan. That study would have\nfocused on the search for an equitable, rational and practical\nsolution that would enable the Republic of China in Taiwan\nto become a full Member of the United Nations.\nUnfortunately, this new but overdue initiative suffered a\ntemporary setback in the General Committee.\nHowever, I find it difficult to envisage that a country of\n21 million people, whose industriousness has contributed to\nmaking their country the fourteenth-largest trading nation in\nthe world, can continue to be impeded from becoming a\nMember of this Organization, where they will be afforded\nthe opportunity to discharge their international obligations\nmore fully. In keeping with its belief in the concept of\nuniversality, Saint Lucia gives support to the Government\nand people of the Republic of China in Taiwan in their\naspiration to become full Members of this world\nOrganization.\nFor many years now, the problems associated with the\nMiddle East have been considered intractable. That\nunforgettable handshake, beamed to us in Saint Lucia live by\nthe wonders of satellite technology, was for us as much a\nsymbol of relief as it was a signal of hope - relief that it\nperhaps marked the beginning of the end of the bloodshed,\nsuffering and hostility which have so plagued that region,\nand hope that their end would bring us one step farther\nalong the path towards global cooperation through which the\nfuture of humanity may eventually be rescued from a world\nwhich has hitherto been seemingly drifting towards self-\ndestruction. My country wishes to convey its\ncongratulations to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and\nChairman Yasser Arafat on this bold and courageous step in\nthe cause of peace against odds which, until then, seemed\ninsurmountable. It is Saint Lucia\u2019s wish that this event will\nignite the spark which kindles a beacon of peace to light the\nregion along its way to realization of its fullest potential.\nThe heroic efforts of President F.W. de Klerk and\nAfrican National Congress President Nelson Mandela in\nSouth Africa must also be praised. They have remained\nunintimidated by violence and endemic opposition in single-\nmindedly spearheading the creation of the Transitional\nExecutive Council, which at long last gives an official say\nto a majority too long disenfranchised by official oppressive\ndictate. This progress allows Saint Lucia fully to support the\nlifting of the remaining sanctions, as called for by Mr.\nMandela. With the recent agreement on Walvis Bay and the\nexpectation that free and fair elections will be held in April\nnext year, perhaps we can soon bring to a close this sad\nchapter of our history.\nHowever, Saint Lucia is less sanguine over the situation\nin some other countries of Africa. The world recession has\nhad an adverse effect on export revenues and therefore on\ntheir foreign-exchange earnings and debt-settlement ability.\nIn addition, political strife has tended to exacerbate these\ndifficulties. The success of globalization in its promotion of\nworld economic growth depends on development which is\nshared. It is important that, in the understandable\nenthusiasm to do everything possible to assist with the\ntransformation of previously centrally managed economies,\nAfrica not be allowed to become a casualty of the ended\ncold war.\nSaint Lucia welcomes the finalization of the\ndemarcation of the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq,\nwhich was accomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary\nDemarcation Commission on 20 May this year. We also\nwelcome the adoption by the Security Council of\nresolution 833 (1993), by which it guaranteed the\ninviolability of the boundary between the two States. This\nguarantee will serve as a deterrent against future conflict\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq. It will also enhance stability and\nsecurity in the region. We call upon Iraq to respect the\nterms of Security Council resolution 833 (1993) and other\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe firm resolve which this Organization, particularly\nthe Security Council, has shown in dealing with the\nproblems of the long-suffering people of Haiti is to be\ncommended. Since the adoption of General Assembly\nresolution 45/2 of 10 October 1990, the United Nations has\ncontinued to reflect the international community\u2019s concern\nand will in its several action-oriented decisions culminating\nin the adoption of Security Council resolution 867 (1993) on\n23 September of this year to deploy both military and\nparamilitary forces in Haiti. With a return to democracy and\nthe application of the economic recovery programme\nenvisaged by the World Bank and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, it is hoped that Haiti will at last\nbegin to experience the economic development which has for\nso long eluded it and which is an absolute imperative for\nalleviating the long suffering of its people.\nSaint Lucia is happy to have been able to contribute\nactively to the process of democratization in Haiti. A team\nof more than 30 Saint Lucians helped with the organization\nof the electoral process and assisted in monitoring the\nelections. Some 15 Saint Lucians are today serving as\nmonitors of human-rights abuses in that country. Saint\nLucia is therefore deeply anxious that the restructuring and\nrecovery process in Haiti should succeed, and we urge the\ninternational community to maintain solidarity with President\nJean-Bertrand Aristide as he returns home to resume the\nmantle of leadership of his country.\nSaint Lucia is a small Caribbean developing island\nState. If developing countries in general are in jeopardy,\nthen small Caribbean developing island countries are\nexposed to double jeopardy. We are all trapped in an\ninternational economic system which yields no quarter to the\nproblems and needs that are peculiar to us, and additionally\ninsists upon using a continental measuring rod as a gauge of\nour development processes. Like castaways set adrift on the\nworld\u2019s oceans, we have for some time been desperately\ntrying to catch the ears of those who happily stand on solid\nground. But our voices have somehow failed to carry in the\nface of the biting winds of global change which have, almost\novernight, altered the very environment within which we\nhave been conditioned by history to survive.\nIt is true that the small Caribbean island developing\ncountries have in some cases registered important\ndevelopment gains over the past 10 to 15 years, a period\nwhich marks the attainment of sovereignty for these small\ndeveloping countries. But the gains, where they do exist,\nhave been achieved only by Herculean effort and should not\nbe interpreted as evidence that particular or even special\nconsideration in the granting of economic and technical\nassistance is not now still needed to promote sustained\ndevelopment. These gains are to be seen, rather, in the\ncontext of the maxim: \\\"One should help those who try to\nhelp themselves\\\". The graduation of the small Caribbean\nisland developing countries from the World Bank\u2019s \\\"soft\nwindow\\\" into net contributor status within the United\nNations Development Programme - a graduation determined\nsolely on the basis of an index of per capita income - is in\nour case tantamount to helping a drowning man onto a raft\nand then setting him adrift without a paddle.\nApart from having average per capita incomes that are\nonly two-thirds that of developing countries in general, the\nsmall Caribbean island developing countries are burdened, as\na factor of scale of operations, by administrative costs which\nare proportionately three times as high as that of continental\ndeveloping countries. With our natural resources limited in\nquantity as well as diversity, the odds between success and\nfailure become marginal and purely a matter of the quality\nof administration. Where no resource surpluses exist, little\nroom is left for mistakes. Yet, because of our small national\nbudgets and disproportionately high administrative costs, we\noften find ourselves unable to afford the diversity and\nquality of expertise required to broaden the odds.\nIn the case of my country, Saint Lucia, this already\nprecarious economic situation is now compounded by a\ndirect attack on the sole item of domestic exports which\nvirtually keeps us from sinking into the depths of economic\ndespair. As a primary agricultural state, Saint Lucia is the\nlargest producer of bananas in the eastern Caribbean. As\nused here, however, \\\"largest\\\" is an extremely relative term.\nWorld annual banana production is currently about 10\nmillion tons, of which the small States of the Windward\nIslands, comprising Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and\nSaint Lucia, produce less than 300,000, Saint Lucia\nproducing about half of that quantity. Over 50 per cent of\nthe working populations of these islands work in banana-\nassociated enterprises. Both in Dominica and Saint Lucia,\nmore than 50 per cent of export earnings is derived from\nbanana exports. Our agricultural production is completely in\nthe hands of many small private farmers. There is no\nGovernment banana-production ownership and there are no\nlatifundia. Because of topographical constraints that\nadversely affect production costs, our banana industry has\nbeen assisted to survive primarily through the umbrella of\nmodest preferential arrangements made available under the\nvarious Lom\u00e9 Conventions.\nToday, there are forces at work, urged on by\nmultinational business interests, which would seek to wrest\nfrom us even the minuscule share - just 2 per cent of the\nmarket - which has enabled our economies barely to weather\nan increasingly hostile economic environment. In order to\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 19\nattempt to secure that end, they have also mounted initiatives\nin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), in\nthe European Court and within various international forums.\nApart from the serious social consequences which cannot but\nfollow a demise of the banana industry in these islands, it is\nalso to be recognized that, in order to purchase goods and\nservices from those very sources which advocate measures\ncalculated to bring about that demise, we must first earn the\nforeign exchange to be able to do this. It can only be hoped\nthat, in the end, sympathetic understanding will prevail over\nintransigence in the determination of this vital issue.\nIn this post-cold-war era, ideological considerations\nhave given way to political initiatives in the determination of\nthe direction of official-aid flows. The weight given to\nforeign policy in deciding on foreign-aid flows means that\nassistance is not always necessarily directed towards areas of\ngreater need, but is directed, rather, to areas with issues\nwhich are politically topical. With a modest per capita\nincome which threatens the little remaining access it has to\nconcessionary assistance, with official financial flows\ndirected elsewhere, and with the main export commodity\nunder attack, Saint Lucia is left to wonder whether there is\nin existence a concerted intention to marginalize small island\ncountries or whether it is merely the accident of present\nworld conditions that bears this responsibility. In any event,\nthe effect remains the same.\nPolitical gain cannot be sustained in the absence of\ncomplementary economic progress. Where world economic\nadvancement is isolated in its impact, political gain in world\nterms will continue to prove transitory and incapable of\nbeing sustained. It is true that the world has seen an\nimpressive political transformation in a rather brief period of\ntime in terms of a transition to democracy and a new degree\nof cooperation in the United Nations at the level of the\nSecurity Council. But if the price of these political gains is\nan exacerbated marginalization of the small developing\ncountries, they will undoubtedly soon be dissipated in a sea\nof economic troubles and the social disruption which\nexperience suggests must follow as a consequence.\nThe urgency of the international debt crisis may have\nbeen defused, but developing-country debt, after reaching a\nbrief plateau, is again on the rise, approaching $1.5 trillion.\nThis situation is made more difficult by the drag on world\neconomic output, which is being caused partly by the\ndislocation of economies of the former Soviet Union and\nEastern Europe. An expansion of world trade, coupled with\nthe recovery of commodity prices, lies at the foundation of\na solution to this problem. That is why we in CARICOM\nare seeking to establish trading and other economic links\nwith our neighbours in the Latin American region and are\nlooking to participate in economic-cooperation initiatives\nwithin the Americas and elsewhere.\nPopulation growth in the developing countries, too,\nthough it has maintained a relatively steady rate for over a\ndecade, continues to increase in numerical terms, accounting\nfor 93 per cent global population growth, which is now\nabout 93 million annually. The balance between economic\nand population growth must be stabilized in the interest of\nhuman progress.\nWe approach the twenty-first century with world\nchanges which have been as rapid as they have been\nbewildering. The ensuing challenge which lies before small\ncountries such as ours, daunting as it is because of our\nslender resources, is to develop the necessary resilience to\nenable us to adapt to these changes. I am of the view that\nincorporated within the idea of universality is the concept of\ncommon progress and the need to ensure that an\nenvironment is created within which world-embracing\nadvancement becomes possible.\nIn this context, the United Nations cannot be expected\nto micro-manage global change; as the pre-eminent global\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nOrganization, its resources must be enhanced to allow it to\nplay an even greater role as a fulcrum, both in the traditional\nspheres of activity and in new areas created by the new\norder of things. The United Nations is, accordingly, seen as\nplaying an expanded role in the economic welfare of\ndeveloping countries, including the development and\napplication of further initiatives to address constraints\nimposed by smallness and island status.\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General\u2019s agenda for\ndevelopment, with the expectation that it will seek to address\nthe new problems and challenges which have arisen even as\nsome of the old issues have been, or are in the process of\nbeing, put to bed.\nLet me assure the Assembly of Saint Lucia\u2019s pledge to\ncontinue to cooperate fully within the institutions of the\nOrganization to further its objectives for the betterment of\nhumanity. What we lack in financial resources we can\nperhaps make up in human resources. The fact that Saint\nLucia has produced two Nobel laureates in this generation is\nindicative, I believe, of our ability to cooperate in the\ncommon pursuit of the noble purposes of this esteemed\nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of Benin and on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Benin, I should like to extend\nmy warm congratulations to Ambassador Insanally on his\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at this session. His unanimous election as leader\nof our deliberations testifies to his abilities; it is also\nrepresents an honour for his country and draws attention to\nthe role played by Caribbean countries in the international\narena.\nI take this opportunity to extend my sincere\ncongratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 43\nably presided over the work of the General Assembly at its\nforty-seventh session.\nIt is also a great pleasure and a privilege for me to pay\na well-deserved tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, who effectively and\nsuccessfully heads this global Organization and who is\nworking intensively to restore peace and security to the\nvarious hotbeds of tension throughout the world.\nThe delegation of Benin solemnly welcomes the new\nStates that have joined the world community to make their\ncontribution to respect for the common basic values of the\nnew society which together, we, the people of the world, are\nendeavouring to build. I welcome the Czech Republic, the\nSlovak Republic, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco and the\nPrincipality of Andorra, whose admission enhances the\nuniversality of this Organization.\nWe are meeting here, as we do each year under similar\ncircumstances, to consider together ways and means of\npromoting peace and prosperity for all our peoples.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, we\nhave witnessed many important events that have given the\ninternational community as a whole new prospects and new\nchallenges in its quest for peace.\nWe welcome the fact that the confrontation between the\ntwo blocs, which for so long had created political tension,\nhas today been replaced by the universal values of\ndemocracy and equality in international relations. These\nvalues are interdependent with economic and social\ndevelopment and with the security of all States.\nIt is also encouraging to see that renewed confidence in\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations in settling conflicts\nhas strengthened the credibility and the capacity to act of the\nOrganization, opening up new areas in which it is able to\nencourage the settlement of a vast range of problems that\nafflict humankind.\nIn just five years, the tasks of the Organization in the\narea of maintaining peace have increased and widened\nconsiderably.\nDespite positive developments, changes currently under\nway that were designed to provide for greater freedom and\nencourage the establishment of more just and more dynamic\nsocieties have unfortunately also become the source of new\nchallenges and even greater uncertainty in international\nrelations. Each day, in one place or another on our planet,\ncivil wars, territorial partition, ethnic confrontations and\ntribal or religious struggles demand the urgent intervention\nof the United Nations.\nWe can see, therefore, how difficult is the task of the\nOrganization, which is obliged to respect a fragile balance\nbetween the sovereignty of States and the duty to intervene.\nIn Europe, the political picture has changed\ndramatically in just a few years. The hopes born of the\ndisappearance of the Berlin Wall have been virtually dashed\nby another, anachronistic war in the former Yugoslavia and\nby the situation in some of the States that emerged from the\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union, thus threatening stability\nand security on the old continent.\nIn Africa, major civil wars continue to rage. These\nwars are responsible for the untold suffering and destruction\nwhich are hampering efforts at socio-economic development\nand recovery in our continent.\nAfrica needs peace and security. Without them the\ncourageous and far-reaching reforms undertaken at the\npolitical and economic levels cannot be successful.\nThe twenty-ninth summit of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) held in Cairo in June of this year provided us\nwith an opportunity to adopt a mechanism for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts. That\nmechanism is an important step forward in the acceptance of\nthe imperative of peace, which is so essential to\ndevelopment. Indeed, conflict management remains a major\nconcern for our countries, as the massive movements of\nrefugees that result from conflicts distract us, to our sorrow,\nfrom the paramount task of development.\nWest Africa, which until now has been a peaceful land\nof asylum, welcoming refugees from the rest of the continent\nand even beyond, is now living through a particularly\ndifficult time, with an unprecedented increase in emergency\nsituations and in the number of refugees, which in less than\nfour years has risen from 20,000 to 1.2 million.\nHere, I would pay a tribute to the humanitarian\nactivities and the considerable efforts of the United Nations\nto settle conflicts in Africa and elsewhere in the world.\nBecause of the support of the United Nations, the\nLiberian conflict today offers encouraging prospects for a\npeaceful and lasting settlement. The major protagonists in\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe Liberian tragedy now seem disposed towards dialogue\nand agreement. They met in Geneva from 10 to\n17 July 1993, with the help of representatives of the\nSecretary-General of the Organization of African Unity and\nthe Executive Secretariat of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) and of the Acting President\nof that Community, to seek ways and means of silencing the\nweapons of war and restoring peace to their country. Those\npresent at the Geneva meeting successfully prepared a\ncomprehensive agreement that takes account of all aspects of\nthe Liberian tragedy.\nIn Cotonou on 25 July 1993, representatives of the\nvarious factions and of the interim Government of Liberia\nsigned that peace agreement, thanks to the mediation of Mr.\nNic\u00e9phore Soglo, President of the Republic of Benin, and\nActing President of ECOWAS. Benin is pleased by the\nwillingness of our Liberian brothers to enter into this\nagreement and by their spirit of constructive and fraternal\ndialogue, without which nothing positive could have been\nachieved. Benin continues to believe that dialogue is the\nonly way of restoring peace to this war-torn country.\nWe welcome the positive results thus far achieved in\nthe implementation of the agreement, most notably the\nobservation of the cease-fire by all the warring factions and\nthe cessation of hostilities.\nIn particular, the delegation of Benin welcomes the\nunanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution\n856 (1993), which supports the efforts of ECOWAS and\napproves the deployment in Liberia of an advance team of\n30 military observers to participate in the work of the Joint\nCease-fire Monitoring Committee. We also welcome\nresolution 866 (1993), which establishes the United Nations\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).\nThis Mission can be made possible only by a\nmobilization of the international community to support the\nefforts of ECOWAS by, inter alia, contributing to the\nspecial trust fund, which would facilitate the dispatch of\nreinforcements to ECOMOG by the African States and help\nprovide for the upkeep of the contingents made available to\nECOMOG by the participating States, as well as by helping\nin carrying out the work of removing mines, providing\nhumanitarian and developmental assistance and promoting\nthe healthy evolution of the electoral process.\nThe three signatories of the 25 July 1993 peace\nagreement met in Cotonou from 15 to 18 August 1993 to set\nup the Council of State, the transitional executive body. The\n25 July peace agreement promises finally to put an end to\nthe very long, devastating war in Liberia.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to make an appeal to\nall the parties who signed that agreement, urging them to\ncontinue to abide by the commitments entered into during\nthe Cotonou talks and to work with ECOWAS and the\nUnited Nations for the proper and swift implementation of\nthose commitments, in order to put an end to the suffering\nof the Liberian people and ensure that the national\nreconciliation process will proceed to its successful\ncompletion.\nAlong the lines of the solution under way in Liberia,\nwe should work to ensure that peace returns to Somalia,\nAngola, the Sudan and Mozambique.\nIn Angola, for example, despite the great hopes and\nexpectations aroused by the agreements reached in Estoril,\nPortugal, we are seriously disturbed and deeply saddened by\nthe resumption of hostilities following the refusal of UNITA\nto recognize the results of the free elections of 29 and\n30 September 1992.\nBenin welcomes the change in the position taken by the\nUnited States Government, which has now granted\ndiplomatic recognition to the legal Government of Angola.\nThis action by the Clinton Administration strengthens the\nposition of the international community in support of the\nverdict of the ballot box rather than the compulsion of the\ngun.\nIn South Africa, developments are encouraging. The\nmultipartite talks made it possible to reach an agreement on,\ninter alia, the establishment of a transitional executive\ncouncil and the holding of the first democratic and\nnon-racial elections in the history of South Africa, scheduled\nfor 27 April 1994.\nThe Government of Benin supports the courageous and\nresponsible appeal by the Chairman of the African National\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the Special\nCommittee against Apartheid in this prestigious Hall of the\nGeneral Assembly on 24 September 1993. He invited the\ninternational community to lift all economic sanctions\nagainst South Africa, except for the arms embargo. Given\nthe positive development that will lead this country, which\nis undergoing a process of reform, to implement the\nprinciple of \\\"one man, one vote\\\", the time has come for all\nMembers of our universal Organization to support the\npeaceful transformation of South Africa.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 45\nBenin wishes to see the African continent free itself of\nall fratricidal and internal wars, of all conflicts that impede\nits development. It is my firm hope that the logic of war\nwill now progressively yield to the logic of peace and\ndevelopment in Africa.\nTurning to the Middle East, 26 years after Israel\u2019s\noccupation of the Arab territories, Benin cannot but greet\nwith joy the historic agreement between the Israeli\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization\ngranting autonomy to Gaza and Jericho.\nThat agreement marks the beginning of a just and\nlasting peace that will allow every State in the region,\nincluding Palestine and Israel, to live within secure and\ninternationally recognized borders guaranteed by the\ninternational community. Our duty is thus to encourage the\ntwo essential parties, as well as all parties involved, to\nundertake or to continue the dialogue necessary for a\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nIn the Persian Gulf region the full restoration of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait helped to\nreaffirm the fundamental principles governing inter-State\nrelations. In this connection we sincerely hope that Security\nCouncil resolution 833 (1993), on the demarcation of the\ninternational border between Iraq and Kuwait, will be\nrespected by all States. Pending issues such as that of the\nKuwaiti prisoners of war must be settled so as to open the\nway to fraternity, cooperation and solidarity in that\nsubregion.\nThe atmosphere of relaxation of tension which began\nwith the end of the cold war and which has made possible\na new spirit of consensus, inter alia in the Security Council,\nis still rather uncertain for much remains to be done to\nconsolidate peace.\nWe must recognize today that the idea of peace can no\nlonger be based on a build-up of weapons; it must be based,\nrather, on concerted efforts on their reduction and complete\nelimination. The balance of terror is now yielding to a\nmeeting of the minds, the hearts and the actions of man.\nThat is why the signing of the United Nations\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction, in Paris on 13-15 January 1993, not\nonly helps to strengthen international peace and security but\nalso offers prospects for international cooperation in the area\nof using the chemicals industry for peaceful purposes.\nBenin, which is dedicated to peace and economic and\nsocial progress, urges the international community to refrain\nfrom any military use of science so that science can be\ndevoted to development, and international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe decision by Russia, the United States of America,\nthe United Kingdom and France to extend their moratorium\non nuclear testing until September 1994 proves that the\nGovernments of those nuclear Powers are increasingly\ninterested in measures that will make it possible to use\nscientific and technical developments exclusively for\npeaceful purposes.\nMy country joins the rest of the international\ncommunity in congratulating the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea on the reversal of its decision to\nwithdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), for that withdrawal from the\nTreaty would only have weakened it, given that its strength\nlies in its universality.\nThe determination shown by Member States to move\ntowards the solution of regional conflicts and the new sense\nof urgency over new threats to the well-being of the planet\ncreate a historic opportunity for us to tackle the economic\nproblems facing all of our countries.\nIndeed, this forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly is taking place against a background of general\neconomic crisis. In the new economic order which is\ncharacterized by increased trade between three dominant\ngroups - Western Europe, North America and the Pacific-\nAsia zone - Africa is virtually left out.\nThe developed North seems to have less and less need\nof Africa\u2019s products and Africa for its part no longer has the\nmeans to buy the goods and services of the North. What is\nmore, the international community does not seem very\nanxious to find a better way of dealing with the African\ncountries\u2019 debt burden.\nThis situation cannot but lead to a slowing down in\ntrade on the world market and directly affect African\neconomies which are already suffering.\nIn these circumstances our survival necessarily requires\nsustained regional integration so that we can be in a better\nposition to deal with the vicissitudes of the international\neconomic environment and take up the challenge of how to\ndevelop our own continent.\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" the Secretary-General\nemphasized the role of regional organizations in establishing\npeace and preventive diplomacy. This role naturally extends\nto development too. We cannot overemphasize the\nimportance of integration for development.\nIn the case of Africa such integration is a means of\nencouraging trade, investment, and research and development\ncooperation among African countries.\nThat is why the Heads of State or Government of the\nmembers of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), meeting in Cotonou from 22 to\n24 July 1993, adopted and signed a revised Treaty of the\nEconomic Community of West African States and reaffirmed\ntheir determination to bring a new dynamism to the process\nof regional integration.\nIf the development of Africa is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Africans themselves, it is no less\nimportant for the international community to recognize the\nprinciple of shared responsibility and full partnership with\nAfrica.\nIn this connection we should note that the\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is not living up to all\nthe hopes that the African countries placed in it. It is\nnecessary further to strengthen national capacities and to\ncreate a climate that is favourable to development.\nWhile Benin welcomes the study on the need and the\nfeasibility of the establishment of a fund to diversify African\ncommodities, we strongly hope that bolder action will be\ntaken with a view to implementing the new programme and\nensuring the input of the major financial contributions which\nare necessary for the establishment of the fund in 1994.\nHence we must increase the quality and the quantity of\nassistance to Africa.\nIn this spirit Benin will in a few days be participating\nin the Tokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment. This Conference, to be held against the\nbackdrop of the new world economic and political order of\nthe post-cold-war era, will provide the international\ncommunity with a new framework for discussing how to\nreaffirm the question of Africa\u2019s economic development as\none of the major concerns of the world today.\nOur hope, widely shared by African countries, is that\nthe Conference, apart from adopting a declaration, will\nactually lead to specific actions and commitments in support\nof Africa.\nThe African countries also hope that the Tokyo\nDeclaration of 9 July 1993 of the Group of Seven\nindustrialized countries - which was designed to replace the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank\nStructural Adjustment Programme with another mechanism\nthat would be better adapted to the conditions and realities\nof developing countries - will soon take effect.\nIf this new mechanism is to have some hope of\nsucceeding, it will have to be drawn up following\nconsultations with the countries that are actually\nexperiencing the harsh social consequences of the Structural\nAdjustment Programme.\nIf we are to win this wager for development, to which\nAfrica aspires, we have to involve women and children, who\nrepresent the majority of the populations of our countries,\nand so, above all, we have to educate and train young people\nand adults.\nIn this connection, the Government of the Republic of\nBenin is actively preparing for the International Year of the\nFamily in 1994. We shall also be participating with great\ninterest in the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, to be held in Cairo from 5 to\n13 September 1994. In addition, we wish to make a real\ncontribution to the preparatory work for the World\nConference on Women, which will be held in Beijing in\n1995.\nThe fact that these various conferences are to be held\nshows that matters relating to social development are\neliciting unprecedented interest in the world. This can also\nbe seen from the decision to convene a World Summit for\nSocial Development in 1995. This renewal of interest is\nmotivated by the profound changes in the social and political\nsituation in the world, and the shifting of priorities at the\nState level.\nDemocracy cannot become stronger unless there is at\nleast a minimum level of prosperity for peoples. One\nobstacle to this strengthening of democracy and thus the full\ndevelopment of human rights is poverty, the poverty in\nwhich the majority of our populations live.\nThe right to development has been ignored for too long.\nIt must now be regarded as a priority right, a sacred right.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 47\nThis right to development is the right to dignity, to personal\ndevelopment, and is not compatible with the subhuman\nstatus afflicting millions of human beings, particularly in\nAfrica, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe right to development is a human right and a\nnational right, and that is why we welcome the conclusions\nof the World Conference on Human Rights, which was held\nin Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993. That Conference\ncertainly marked the beginning of a new era which, we trust,\nwill witness the gradual elimination of the current\ninternational economic order, in which two thirds of\nmankind cannot meet their basic needs and in which\n600 million human beings are living in almost absolute\npoverty. The elimination of such poverty is one of the basic\nobjectives of Agenda 21. The establishment of an\nInternational Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the first of\nwhich will be celebrated on 17 October next, is one step in\nthis direction.\nWe can never say often enough that the major\necological problems facing our countries today have a\nplanetary dimension that requires a world-wide approach.\nThis is why the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development, held in Rio in June 1992, made\nsustainable development one of the major concerns of the\ninternational community.\nThat Conference marked a turning-point in the way that\nwe look at our future. It must now be approached in an\nintegrated manner as we work on our development policies.\nAgenda 21, the basic document that emerged from that\nConference, is an enormous programme of action for the late\ntwentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It requires\nGovernments to adopt national strategies focused on\nsustainable development, in close cooperation with the\nprivate and public sectors.\nHere I am happy to draw attention to the major\nimportance my country attaches to follow-up of the decisions\nand recommendations of Rio. Benin welcomes the\nestablishment of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, which held its first session here in New York\nfrom 14 to 25 June 1993, and we welcome the work of the\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaboration\nof an international convention to combat desertification in\nthose countries experiencing serious drought and/or\ndesertification, particularly in Africa. That Committee has\nalready met, from 24 May to 3 June 1993 in Nairobi and\nfrom 13 to 24 September 1993 in Geneva.\nPursuant to the Rio recommendations, on 9 to\n13 August 1993 Benin held a national seminar on follow-up\nstrategies to implement the results of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, including\nconsideration of chapter 12 of Agenda 21, on how to combat\ndesertification and the impact of drought. The seminar was\nheld at a time when the international community and the\ndevelopment partners of the third world countries were fully\ninvolved in thinking about what strategies should be used to\nmake this concept of sustainable development operational.\nThis seminar was proof of the political will of the\nGovernment of Benin to abide by the commitments we\nentered into at Rio.\nThe Cotonou seminar recommended, inter alia, the\nestablishment of a national commission on sustainable\ndevelopment. A drafting committee for a national Agenda\n21, the major guidelines for which were decided on by the\nseminar, has been set up. It should finish its work by the\nend of this year.\nIn two years, we shall be celebrating the fiftieth\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\nThe years that have passed since 1945 have been\nmarked by ongoing, fundamental change and by a\nconsiderable increase in the membership of the Organization\nas well as by a significant widening of the Organization\u2019s\narea of activity.\nIt is thus obvious that the Organization needs to be\nrestructured to meet our world\u2019s current requirements. This\nis why Benin supports the efforts under way to restructure\nand revitalize the United Nations in its economic and social\nsectors and related areas.\nIn the view of the delegation of Benin, the reform\nshould be designed to ensure better coordination of the\nactivities of the United Nations and wiser utilization of its\nhuman and financial resources.\nBenin, while still open to dialogue in negotiations,\nendorses the view of the Group of 77, particularly on the\nquestion of how to allocate seats on the governing bodies of\nbodies such as the United Nations Development Programme,\nthe United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\nIn the political area, my country is willing to consider\nall proposals that take account of the concerns and interests\nof all the various actors, large and small, in the international\npolitical arena at the end of this second millennium.\n48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nReform of the Security Council is a matter of particular\nimportance to all Member States. Benin will follow closely\nany proposal for reform that might strengthen the\neffectiveness of the Council and avoid transforming it into\na forum for sterile debate or logjams or into an instrument\nthat benefits only a privileged few.\nBefore I conclude my statement, I should like to recall\nthat if we wish to approach the next millennium in\ntranquillity, if we wish to draw satisfaction from the efforts\nmade so far along the tortuous and difficult path towards\ndevelopment, we must do everything possible to give more\nsustained attention to the principle of world-wide partnership\nand the duty to show solidarity which is necessarily implied\nby the new international order that now governs the\ninternational community.\nIt is Benin\u2019s wish that mankind, when it draws up its\nfirst balance sheet of this new era, should see a drop in the\nnumber of ills that continue to undermine the twentieth\ncentury, namely poverty, famine, endemic diseases such as\nmalaria, the AIDS pandemic and its devastating human,\nsocial and economic consequences, illiteracy, environmental\ndegradation, underdevelopment, and all those other ills that\nbeset us.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, and faced with\nthis challenge, nations must agree to yield part - only part -\nof their national sovereignty to our universal human values,\nand to show greater determination to coexist despite cultural,\npolitical, social and economic differences. Only in that way\ncan the world of the twenty-first century be a more\nhospitable one for people, wherever they may live and\nwhoever they may be.\n"

        "file_text": "The Malawi delegation is\npleased to join other delegations in congratulating you, Mr.\nPresident, on your election to preside over the business of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Guyana is\na sister country which is held in high regard and admiration\nby Malawi. You are an illustrious son of Guyana and are\nhighly qualified and fully prepared to lead and manage the\nenormous tasks which must be accomplished at this session\nof the General Assembly. My delegation wishes your\npresidency great success.\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly\nconsidered important and, in some cases, intractable issues.\nThis would not have been possible were it not for the\npainstaking patience, efficiency and diplomatic skills of its\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, a distinguished international\njurist and former Foreign Minister of Bulgaria. The Malawi\ndelegation congratulates him on a job well done.\nMy delegation wishes to express its profound sorrow\nfor the considerable suffering, loss of life and destruction of\nproperty caused by the earthquake which occurred on 29\nSeptember 1993 in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The\nheartfelt and sincere condolences of the Government and the\npeople of Malawi unreservedly go to the Government and\nthe people of India as they struggle to alleviate the painful\nafter-effects of this tragedy.\nWe are thankful to God for giving Malawi good rains\nin the season just ended. The drought experienced in the\nlast two seasons was severe and devastating in its effects.\nAll of southern Africa suffered terribly from this scourge.\nMalawi\u2019s economy was seriously affected by the drought,\nbeginning in February 1992. In 1991 economic growth was\n7.8 per cent in real gross domestic product. It declined in\nreal terms by 7.9 per cent during 1992, which represented a\nprecipitous fall in real income for the people. The volume\nof maize, our staple food, was only 600,000 tonnes in 1992,\ndown from the 1991 production level of 1.6 million tonnes.\nIn 1993 Malawi had a good harvest of close to 2 million\ntonnes of maize. However, complete recovery from the\ndrought will take some time.\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity, on\nbehalf of my Government and the people of Malawi, to\nthank the United Nations system and, in particular, the\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs, which were the major\ncatalysts in the United Nations -southern African\nDevelopment Community drought relief programme. We\nalso thank the bilateral donors and the non-governmental\norganizations which, together, saved the day for Malawi and\nthe whole southern African region with massive imports of\nfood, medicines and other humanitarian assistance supplies.\nHowever, the Malawi economy continues to be confronted\nby a major balance-of-payments deficit problem arising from\nthe large volume of maize imports during the drought.\nMalawi has been hosting a large number of refugees\nfrom Mozambique, who started entering Malawi in large\nnumbers in 1986, and by 1992 the refugee population in the\ncountry had soared to about 1.5 million people. The Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\nWorld Food Programme, non-governmental organizations\nand many other interested parties that have throughout been\nintimately involved in this humanitarian task will agree that,\ndespite the severe adverse impact of hosting such a large\nnumber of people, Malawi is managing one of the most\nsuccessful refugee programmes in the world, thanks to the\nprevailing peace, which is due to stable political leadership,\ngood and reliable security structures and a fairly efficient\nadministration.\nMr. Martini Herrera (Guatemala), Vice-President,\ntook the Chair.\nThe problem of the Mozambican refugees in Malawi,\nwhich was a consequence of the civil war between the\nGovernment of Mozambique and RENAMO, will come to an\nend as all protocols of the Rome General Peace Accord are\nimplemented in full. Malawi, which was represented at the\nhistoric signing of the Peace Accord on 4 October 1992,\ncommends President Chissano of the Republic of\nMozambique and Mr. Dhlakama, President of RENAMO, for\nsigning the Peace Accord. We strongly encourage them to\ncontinue to work closely together and with the United\nNations to ensure that peace and political stability are firmly\nestablished in Mozambique. This is a prerequisite for the\nreconstruction of that great and beautiful country to\ncommence and for progress to be realized in all areas of\ndevelopment. My delegation is therefore fully supportive of\nSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) and calls on all the\nparties to implement it speedily.\nThe Government and people of Malawi wish to see the\nuninterrupted repatriation of their brothers and sisters to their\nhomes in Mozambique in safety and security. We therefore\ncall for the specific prioritization of the de-mining\nprogramme, the demobilization of the armed forces and their\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nplacement in the designated assembly areas, and the\nfinalization of discussions on the draft electoral law. The\npeople of Mozambique demand this, and it is also in the\nvital interests of Malawi, which has suffered tremendously\nfrom the adverse impact of the 16-year civil war in\nMozambique.\nMy delegation wishes to stress that the cost of hosting\nover 1 million refugees not only is very high but, for\nMalawi, has reached a crisis point. This cost is paid in the\ndisplacement of Malawians from agricultural land; in\nover-grazing, deforestation and environmental degradation;\nin tremendous pressures and strain on the Government\nadministrative infrastructure, budgetary and human resources;\nand, not least, in the strain on the socio-economic\ninfrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads, bridges and\nwater supplies. My delegation is taking this opportunity to\nappeal to the donor community for assistance in all these\nareas, which are crucial for the country\u2019s sustainable\ndevelopment.\nThe General Peace Accord in Mozambique is close to\nthe heart of Malawi. I therefore wish to reiterate that\nMalawi will continue to collaborate with Mozambique\nclosely - at the bilateral level, between the Governments of\nthe two sister countries; through the Tripartite Commission,\nwhose members are Malawi, the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and\nMozambique; and through the Malawi-Mozambique Security\nCommission - until the peace process has been consolidated.\nPeace and the return of normal life in Mozambique will\nguarantee Malawi the use of its traditional, and shortest,\nroutes to the sea via the ports of Nacala and Beira. The\nreopening and full use of these ports will represent\nconsiderable savings through highly reduced transport costs\nand in limited foreign exchange resources.\nMy country undertook the most historic event since\nindependence by holding, on 14 June 1993, the national\nreferendum which was initiated by our President, His\nExcellency Ngwazi Kamuzu Banda in order to give the\npeople of Malawi the opportunity to choose between a\none-party and multi-party system of government. My\ndelegation is pleased to report to this Assembly that by all\naccounts, including those of the United Nations, it was a\npeaceful, free and fair exercise. Sixty-three per cent of the\npopulation voted for a multi-party system of government.\nTheir decision was respected and accepted by my President\nin a landmark statement on 17 June 1993, which included an\nannouncement of his intention to amend the Constitution to\nallow for the formation of political parties, to call for a\ngeneral election in a year\u2019s time and to declare a general\namnesty to enable political exiles to return home and\nparticipate in the political process.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to convey to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the gratitude\nof my Government and the people of Malawi for the\nassistance the United Nations system provided in making the\nnational referendum exercise a resounding success.\nIntergovernmental organizations such as the European\nCommunity and other bilateral donors also provided Malawi\nwith invaluable assistance during this period. My\nGovernment is most grateful to all of them. What has\nhappened in Malawi demonstrates beyond question the\nrepeatedly stated commitment of my President and his\nGovernment to peaceful reforms, good governance, human\nrights and democratization. Those who did not believe in\nthe seriousness of this commitment have been proved totally\nwrong.\nFor the last 29 years of its independence, Malawi has\nbeen preoccupied with socio-economic development, which\nis rural-based in its reality, as a matter of sustained and\ndeliberate Government policy. The country had no other\nchoice because it is completely agricultural, with a large\nsmall-holder agriculture component as its backbone. The\npolitical leadership consistently and untiringly preached the\ndoctrine of respect for the land and farming to the ordinary\npeople in the villages throughout the country. This has paid\noff in the disciplined commitment the Malawi people have\nto farming. As a consequence, over the years a large\nproportion of donor financing has focused on the agricultural\nsector.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf\nof my Government, all the multilateral donors - the Bretton\nWoods institutions and the African Development Bank,\namong others - and the bilateral cooperating partners for the\nunremitting assistance they have given Malawi, enabling it\nto implement successfully its agricultural programmes and\nprojects over these past years. Without this assistance, it\nwould not have been possible to achieve the sense of\ndiscipline and respect for farming that is now consolidated\nin the people of Malawi, which confirms a vision that the\nMalawi leadership has carried out with practical zeal and\ntenacity.\nRegrettably, in the very recent past, Malawi\u2019s modest\nachievements in the agricultural sector and the economy in\ngeneral have had to go through severe and unpalatable\nshocks well beyond the Government\u2019s control, such as the\ndrought and refugee problems. But, more than that, the\neconomy has had to cope in the past year with the sudden\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 19\nsuspension of donor assistance by the Government\u2019s\ndeveloped partners. Consequently, the country\u2019s balance-of-\npayments financing requirements were badly affected and\nthis disproportionately imposed considerable negative results\non the economy\u2019s performance. For example, private-sector\nfirms performed far below capacity and the financing of\nalmost all agreed development projects stopped suddenly and\ncompletely. Malawi is small, poor and landlocked. It is\nalso in the category of least developed countries, with a\npopulation of only about 9 million. Malawi could therefore\nhardly sustain or cushion this kind of massive damage to its\neconomy. Its external debt burden soared, its terms of trade\ndeteriorated badly and the livelihood of the ordinary men,\nwomen and children in the villages was badly affected.\nThe issues of human rights, good governance and other\nconditionalities that were behind these actions by the donor\ncommunity have now, I am happy to say, been dealt with\ndecisively, each one in an irreversible manner and, where\napplicable, by Act of Parliament. For example, due process\nof law is firmly established and in practice in Malawi.\nThere are no political detainees in any of its prisons. The\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross is workinq closely\nwith the Government, and has already visited all prisons and\nmade recommendations for improvements where this has\nbeen found to be necessary. There is freedom of expression\nin the country. As I speak, over 20 newspapers and\nmagazines are in circulation. So far, six political parties\nhave registered and are bracing themselves for the\nforthcoming general election.\nAt present the Malawi Congress Party, which is\ncontinuing to rule the country until the people elect a new\ngovernment, has, together with other political parties in the\ncountry, established the National Consultative Council and\nthe National Executive Committee, which have clearly\ndefined powers to oversee the transitional process in the run-\nup to the general election. Each of the political parties,\nincluding the Malawi Congress Party, has equal\nrepresentation on the National Consultative Council and the\nNational Executive Committee. Those institutions ensure\nand guarantee that there is dialogue between and among\nMalawians, who discuss and resolve whatever differences\nmay exist on the issues affecting the transition. Those\ninstitutions replace the President\u2019s Committee on Dialogue\nand the Public Affairs Committee, which were established\nimmediately after the referendum and, in addition, are\ndesigned to work closely with the Government and the\nNational Parliament. The United Nations, particularly\nthrough its Electoral Assistance Unit in the Secretariat here\nin New York and through the Centre for Human Rights in\nGeneva, has been a catalyst in this whole transitional\nprocess. My Government is therefore most encouraged,\nbeing convinced that the peace and stability that have existed\nsince the holding of the national referendum will continue\nuntil and after the forthcoming general election, which is\nexpected to take place some time in May 1994.\nThese positive and irreversible developments I have\ndescribed give my Government the confidence that all its\nbilateral- development partners and its major multilateral\ndonors will fully resume development assistance flows and\nbalance-of-payments support to Malawi. This, we hope, will\nbe done without further delays, in the interests of reviving\nthe economy quickly and reducing the severe damage it has\nsustained and the unnecessary continued suffering of its\npeople.\nThe Malawi delegation is grateful to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), in particular, because it\nwas the first to confirm, in a report to its Governing Council\nat its fortieth session, in June, that there existed in Malawi\nan enabling political, economic and social environment to\nimplement its Fifth Country Programme. The Malawi\nGovernment has no need to prove its abiding commitment to\ndevelopment. Allow me, therefore, to take this opportunity\nto appeal to the donor community not to reduce its pledges\nof funding to the UNDP. To do so would have catastrophic\neffects on the whole democratization process, on the ongoing\nfield programmes and projects and also on the successful\nprojects being implemented under the Fifth Country\nProgramme.\nAt this juncture the Malawi delegation wishes to\nreaffirm its unwavering support of the recently adopted\nTokyo Declaration on African Development, which\nrepresents the first concrete action and commitment of the\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa\nin the 1990s. Malawi, a least-developed country, would also\nlike to take this opportunity to lend its unwavering support\nto the Programme of Action for Least-Developed Countries,\nwhich found its expression in the Declaration issued by the\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of least-developed countries\nwhen they met here in New York on 30 September 1993,\nand to the Declaration of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of\nthe Group of 77 that was adopted on 5 October 1993. We\nhope that the donor community will respond positively and\nact accordingly on these specific problems affecting the\ndeveloping countries. Their decisive resolutions are pivotal\nto the role of the United Nations in development and integral\nto the call issued in General Assembly resolution 47/181 for\nthe Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on\nan agenda for development and for the Assembly to discuss\nit in its preliminary form at this current session.\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMalawi is not oblivious of the wider political\natmosphere that is affecting international relations and\ncausing serious problems with regard to peace and security.\nThe desperate situation and horrendous scenes of the civil\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina represent one such example.\nIt is the strong conviction of the Malawi Government that\npeace is the only answer to the unending violence we are\nwitnessing in the Balkans. There is an extremely urgent\nneed to end the suffering of the people there - innocent men,\nwomen and children. My delegation strongly supports all\nefforts of the United Nations and the European Community,\nand those of other parties, to resolve the problem through the\nongoing negotiations in Geneva and elsewhere. The problem\nis a human catastrophe, notwithstanding its tragic, historical\nroots.\nWith regard to Somalia, my Government is of the view\nthat the Somalis should resolve their problems themselves.\nHowever, the prerequisite for realizing that objective is to\nestablish and consolidate peace throughout Somalia and to\nhelp create processes that will make it possible for the\ncountry to reaffirm its sovereignty. Tremendous\nhumanitarian-assistance achievements have already been\nmade to alleviate the plight of the Somali people, who are\nsuffering from hunger, starvation and death in the midst of\nmayhem, anarchy and the complete collapse of civil\nauthority. The United Nations and the international\ncommunity, through the contributions of selfless non-\ngovernmental organizations and all nations - particularly the\nUnited States, which has contributed troops under the United\nNations flag - deserve to be thanked for bringing Somalia\nback to life. In the view of my delegation, it is imperative\nthat the United Nations and the international community be\nallowed to complete this wholesome task by establishing\nconditions for peace and civil authority based clearly on the\nAddis Ababa agreements of 27 March 1993. The Malawi\ndelegation fully supports the present United Nations role in\nSomalia.\nSimilarly, it is the strong conviction of my Government\nthat the present situation in Angola calls for strong and\ndramatic action by the international community. The United\nNations has been selfless in what it has done in Angola,\nwhere the untold suffering of women, children and the\nelderly goes on unabated and is indeed completely\ninexplicable and totally unnecessary. The Malawi delegation\ncalls upon the Organization of African Unity, the United\nNations and the signatory Powers to the Bicesse Peace\nAccords to compel the UNITA leadership to come to the\nnegotiating table with the Angola Government to establish\npeace, security and stability in the country. My Government\nfully supports Security Council resolution 864 (1993), which\nhas now been put into effect. Dr. Savimbi and the UNITA\nleadership must not ignore international concerns and the\ncontent of that resolution. They must honour and respect the\nresults of the United Nations-supervised general election,\nwhich by all accounts was free and fair.\nWith regard to the situation in South Africa, the Malawi\ndelegation wishes to put on record its complete support for\nthe historic agreement by the Multi-Party Negotiating\nCouncil in Johannesburg, whose successfully negotiated\ntransitional institutions have now been enacted into law by\nthe parliament in Cape Town. Those institutions are\ndesigned to oversee and control the influential factors in the\nrun-up to the general election on 27 April 1994. I refer in\nparticular to the Transitional Executive Council and to the\nIndependent Broadcasting Authority, the Independent Media\nCommission and the Independent Electoral Commission.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity, on behalf of the\nMalawi Government, to congratulate all the parties on the\nNegotiating Council and, in particular, the African National\nCongress and Mr. Nelson Mandela, its President, and the\nPresident of South Africa, Mr. Frederick de Klerk and his\nNational Party. It has been a very long haul to reach this\nhistoric stage, and the imperative is therefore clear, namely,\nthat all possible assistance by the United Nations, the\nOrganization of African Unity, the European Community,\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat and friendly Governments\nand people of good will must now be intensified in order to\nremove all forms of violence, ensure that the general election\ntakes place on 27 April 1994 and that a non-racial,\ndemocratic government is installed in South Africa, based on\nthe will of the majority of its people.\nMy delegation welcomes the historic agreement on\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) which was signed on 13\nSeptember 1993 in Washington, D.C. It provides a\nframework for lasting peace in the Middle East, and in the\nview of the Malawi delegation, it deserves all the support it\ncan receive from all well-disposed sources. History dictates\nthat this should be so. This agreement is a prerequisite to\ninternational peace, security and political stability beyond the\nMiddle East.\nThe PLO/Israel peace agreement is yet another\ndemonstration of the dramatic changes in international\nrelations that have taken place in the last three to four years,\nfollowing the collapse of communism and the end of the\ncold war. It is in this context, that my Government is\noptimistic that the still unresolved major international\npolitical issues will be similarly dealt with, issues such as\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 21\nthe problem of North and South Korea and that of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of China on\nTaiwan. In the view of the Malawi delegation, the time has\nnow come for serious consideration to be given to the\neligibility of the Republic of China on Taiwan to become a\nMember of the United Nations. We cannot talk about\nhuman rights and the universality of the United Nations\nwhile in the same breath ignoring the existence of over 20\nmillion people in the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nFinally, allow me to make observations on two\npertinent issues. First, my delegation welcomes the recent\npronouncement by the United States delegation on\nsupporting the membership of Japan and Germany in the\nSecurity Council. This announcement is definite recognition\nthat the time has come for representation in the Security\nCouncil to reflect the changed international political scene\nand reality as well as geographical balance. The Security\nCouncil must not only be transparent in its decision-making;\nit is a political necessity that it also reflect what the world\nis today, and not what it was 48 years ago. There is no\nother organ in the United Nations today which makes such\nmomentous decisions affecting international peace and\nsecurity. My delegation is therefore strongly of the view\nthat Africa equally deserves to have a permanent seat or\nequal and balanced representation of some kind, in the\nCouncil. The Malawi delegation looks forward to the\nexpected deliberations on this issue, which will inevitably go\nbeyond the life of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly.\nRepresentation on governing councils of the respective\nUnited Nations agencies and bodies is another important\nsubject before the General Assembly at this session, in the\ncontext of the reform, restructuring and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations in all its aspects. My delegation supports a\nnegotiated approach to the points of disagreement between\nthe developing countries and their partners in development\nas a whole. The only way forward is for the two groups to\nwork together and arrive at a consensus by the end of\nNovember 1994. My delegation will support the view taken\nby the Group of 77 on this issue, when it comes to a\nconclusion in due course.\nI wish you, Sir, and the Assembly fruitful deliberations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with profound pleasure\nthat my delegation conveys greetings and best wishes from\nthe Government and the people of Grenada to the United\nNations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nMy delegation is pleased to extend sincere\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly during this forty-eighth\nsession. We are especially pleased because you create\nhistory by being the first person from the region to which\nGrenada belongs to hold the prestigious post of General\nAssembly Presidency, coming as you do from our sister\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) country, the Republic\nof Guyana.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity also to commend\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for the excellent manner in\nwhich he conducted the Assembly\u2019s proceedings at its forty-\nseventh session. My Government also wishes to extend its\ncommendations to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his indefatigable efforts in\nthe service of the Organization.\nThe Grenadian delegation is pleased to extend a warm\nwelcome to the six new Members of the United Nations:\nthe Czech Republic; the Republic of Slovakia, Eritrea,\nMonaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and\nAndorra.\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15\nThe problems of developing countries are still daunting.\nEvery country must try to help itself. My Government\ncontinues to pursue its own economic structural adjustment\nprogramme, with which the people of Grenada have shown\ngreat understanding and cooperation. But prolonged\ndifficulties in the economic sector can give rise to attitudes\nand conditions that can adversely impact upon social\ndevelopment and administrative capacities, and so my\ndelegation calls on the international community to show\ngreater flexibility in assisting the adjustment process of\nGrenada and other countries experiencing economic\nconditions similar to Grenada\u2019s.\nPoverty, debt, inadequate resources, marginalization and\nthe lack of secure markets for our products deal serious\nblows to social, economic and political stability. Further, the\nimpact on small, undiversified economies from liberalizing\ntrade regimes and regional trading blocs has been shocking.\nThe fact is that free trade is not always synonymous with\nfair trade: factors of size, resource endowment and levels of\ndevelopment must be duly considered in settling trade\nrelations. This is particularly so with small, open, primary-\nproducing economies, where one serious natural disaster,\nsuch as a hurricane, can devastate all the fruits of our\nnational labour invested in bananas, cocoa and nutmeg.\nIn this scenario, concessioned trade is very much\nneeded to produce anything like a level playing field.\nDeveloping countries will not progress on sympathy; they\nrequire equity. Small countries such as Grenada cannot do\nit all alone. We need assistance for diversification, for\ndevelopment of our human resources and for the\nimplementation of sustainable development.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED) has placed before the world a wide\nrange of challenges for managing the environment in a\nsustainable way. Developing countries, in particular small\nisland nation States, like Grenada, are anxious that all\nGovernments should move faster to effect the programme\nlaid out by UNCED\u2019s plan of work on sustainable\ndevelopment, Agenda 21.\nGreater emphasis needs to be placed by donor agencies\non training, as well as on technical and financial assistance\nto developing countries to aid in sustainable forestry and\nagricultural practices. My delegation is convinced that the\nproblems of the environment cannot wait. Grenada is\nparticularly pleased with Agenda 21\u2019s special recognition of\nthe peculiar difficulties confronting the development of small\nisland developing States and with the Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates (SIDS), arising from that recognition, that will be held\nin Barbados in April and May 1994.\nIt is Grenada\u2019s sincere hope that that Conference will\nserve to generate a better understanding of the challenges\nand predicaments confronting small island developing States,\nand that it will produce the necessary partnership and\nestablish a sound path to their sustainable development.\nMuch of the important negotiations preparatory to the\nConference remains incomplete. My delegation is concerned\nthat the success of the Barbados Conference may be\njeopardized unless an intercessional mechanism is arranged\nto provide for the advancement of the negotiations prior to\nApril 1994.\nGrenada joins the rest of the world in rejoicing over the\nsuccess of diplomatic perseverance in Afghanistan, El\nSalvador, Nicaragua, Cambodia and Haiti. Grenada is,\nhowever, highly disturbed by the renewal of politically\nmotivated violence in Haiti. Grenada will continue to rally\nbehind the United Nations and the Organization of American\nStates in their efforts to restore democracy and stability to\nHaiti. Grenada welcomes the Governors Island negotiated\nsettlement aimed at restoring to Haiti the legitimate\nGovernment of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. We\nsupport the establishment of an international constabulary\nforce in that country. We call on all in Haitian society to\ngive democracy and peace a chance.\nGrenada wishes to record its satisfaction over the\nhistoric attainment of formal recognition between Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). We further\napplaud the signing of the Palestinian autonomy agreement\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. It\nis a long-awaited peace initiative which will pave the way\nfor the continued peaceful negotiation of tougher issues.\nSuch a step will, in the long term, contribute to making the\nMiddle East and the world a more peaceful place.\nGrenada welcomes the peace agreements initialled\nbetween Israel and Morocco and between Israel and Jordan\nas steps in the right direction.\nGrenada welcomes the finalization of the demarcation\nof the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq, which was\naccomplished by the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation\nCommission on 20 May 1993. We also welcome the\nadoption by the Security Council of its\nresolution 833 (1993), in which it guaranteed the\ninviolability of the boundary between the two States and\ncalled for respect for that resolution.\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMy Government is, on the other hand, perturbed by the\ncontinuing wars in other parts of the world, such as the\nformer Yugoslavia, Liberia, Somalia and Angola. We are\nalarmed at the lack of respect for United Nations peace--\nkeepers and aid workers, and call upon all sides in such\nconflicts to turn to peaceful negotiation and respect for\nhuman lives.\nThe promotion of democracy and the enhancement of\nhuman rights must be vigorously pursued. The process of\ndemocratization has to be entrenched. My delegation,\nmoreover, looks forward to welcoming to the United\nNations, in the near future, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan. With its 21 million people, the Republic of China\non Taiwan, has, over the past 20 years, progressed\neconomically, socially and democratically to the point where\nit can no longer properly be kept out of the United Nations.\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan has established diplomatic\nrelations with a number of countries and has significantly\ncontributed to the uplifting of the struggling economies of a\ngreat number of countries and the development of their\npeoples. Surely, these impressive achievements eminently\nqualify the Republic of China on Taiwan for admission to\nthis Organization.\nPeace and democracy reaching areas new to them has\nnoticeably been resulting in the deflection of aid to them, at\nthe expense of traditional stable democracies. That newly\nemerging democracies have to be given due attention cannot\nbe denied, but this cannot be wholly at the expense of the\nold democracies. The peace dividend accruing from the end\nof the cold war and the halting of the arms race should be\nexpansive enough to nurture new democracies without\nabandoning old ones to unnecessary and far-reaching social\nand societal conflicts. After all, the issue of development is\nno less important than the issue of peace.\nInternational peace presupposes domestic quietude in\nthe States making up the community of nations. This\nrequires continuing emphasis on human-resource\ndevelopment and the enhancement of cultural and social\namenities in such areas as education, health and housing. In\nthis regard, Grenada insists on the protection of the rights of\nthe child, enhancement of the rights of women and the\nstrengthening of the family unit. The pursuit of the human\nrace must be the nurturing of peace by the ending of\ndiscrimination and the enhancement of equality, whether\nbetween sexes or races, or with regard to social origins,\nreligion or whatever other differences might have been\ncreated through ignorance or arrogance. As we in Grenada\nsay \\\"A child is a child\\\".\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of a\ncriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It is with great\nconcern that the world has witnessed men, women and\nchildren being massacred in that region in the name of\nethnicity and religion. Grenada takes this opportunity to\nencourage the establishment of similar tribunals in areas\nwhere they may be necessary.\nSuch cooperation as the world is seeing today in\nrestoring democracy and civil and political rights to citizens\nof warring countries ought to be extended to the field of\ninternational criminal activities. Grenada stands ready to\ncollaborate with other countries in putting a halt to such\nactivities as illicit drug production, trafficking and\nconsumption and money-laundering and their associated ills.\nThese tend to decay the moral fibre of a society and drain\nalready scant resources in efforts to combat the menace, thus\nfrustrating national development processes. Grenada has\naccordingly enacted legislation giving effect to the United\nNations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\nand Psychotropic Substances, of 1988, providing for the\nforfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds of crime,\noutlawing moneylaundering and promoting bilateral and\nmultilateral cooperation in the fight against these menaces.\nGrenada is very pleased that the South African\nParliament has agreed to establish a Transitional Executive\nCouncil, which is expected to allow the black majority to\nparticipate in the governing of their country. We received\nwith joy the news that 27 April 1994 has been set as the\ndate for the election of a Government in South Africa in\nwhich South Africans of all races, colours, beliefs and\ngenders will participate. We applaud the efforts that have\nbeen made by the Government of President De Klerk and\nthe African National Congress of Nelson Mandela to usher\nin genuine democracy in South Africa. We encourage all\nSouth Africans to give full support to that progress.\nThroughout the world, people are looking towards the\nUnited Nations for solutions to their political, economic,\nethnic and social problems. The freeing of the United\nNations from ideological tensions has made this possible; but\nwe are aware that the United Nations must now be\nrestructured, the better to meet these ends. The composition\nof the Security Council should be re-examined, with new\npermanent seats on that Council being allotted to such\ncountries as Japan, without current permanent membership\nbeing affected. Also, additional seats should be added.\nFurther, an appropriate mechanism is needed to establish\nadequate oversight and accountability in the United Nations.\nThe capability of the United Nations to conduct\npeace-keeping should be enhanced and rationalized.\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 17\nWorld security requires all of us, nations great as well\nas small, to make extra efforts to attain and maintain peace\nand democracy for development. As a community of\nnations, let us therefore work diligently and tirelessly to\nattain these goals.\n"

        "file_text": "There can be no doubt that today \\\"transition\\\" is\nthe key word that defines the process that my country, along\nwith others, is undergoing. The inclusion in the agenda of\nthe General Assembly of an item on countries in transition\nexemplifies the Assembly\u2019s capacity to respond swiftly to\nthe concerns of its members.\nLast year, my predecessor stressed to the General\nAssembly the importance of Romanian society\u2019s capacity to\nlearn. Since then, my country has continued to learn that\ndemocracy, the rule of law, political pluralism, a market\neconomy, and respect for human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms are necessary conditions for individual potential\nand aspirations to be fulfilled.\nWe have also learned that the transition will last longer\nthan expected, that the challenges it presents are greater than\nwe imagined and that its social costs are heavier than we\nfirst estimated. However, these bitter lessons do not in any\nway dissuade us from our irreversible choice: democracy\nand a market economy.\nAs the Assembly may know, during 1992 free and fair\nlocal, general and presidential elections took place in\nRomania. The first stage of restructuring the political life\nand strengthening the rule of law has thus been completed.\nClearly, the political process is still undergoing changes.\nEleven parties are now represented in Parliament. Moreover,\na special provision of our electoral law guarantees a seat in\nthe legislature for each national minority, even if their\npolitical organizations did not obtain the required minimum\nof votes. At the same time, there is a slow but steady trend\ntowards a clearer shaping of political diversity into stronger\nand better defined political forces.\nAs for economic restructuring, in March 1993 the\nGovernment formed after the general elections presented its\nstrategy for economic and social reform to the Romanian\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 21\nParliament. The central idea of this strategy is that the\ntransition to a market economy should be as fast as possible.\nWhile focusing on privatization and structural changes, at\nboth the macro-economic and micro-economic levels, the\nGovernment also pays particular attention to their social\ncosts.\nThis year we have taken some decisive steps. On 1\nMay the Government ended all subsidies for the production\nof consumer goods and as of 1 July the value added tax\nbecame the sole fiscal instrument.\nWe already note a growing interest on the part of some\nmajor Western companies in investing in and cooperating\nwith viable Romanian companies. This augurs well for the\nstimulation of economic activity.\nHowever, our economy still faces some major\ndifficulties, inherent in the transition period. At the same\ntime, unfavourable external circumstances have during the\nlast three years triggered a dramatic fall in the output of\nimportant economic sectors. They include the reduction in\neconomic cooperation with neighbouring countries and the\nadverse effects of the successive United Nations embargoes\nimposed on Iraq, Libya and the Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia, all strictly observed by Romania.\nOur experience over recent years has shown that\ninternal efforts can be decisively catalyzed by foreign\nassistance, both financial and managerial. Therefore, we\nbelieve that international assistance in the next few years\ncould speed up our reform process and boost industrial\nproduction, while improving the Romanian economy\u2019s\nintegration into the world economy.\nTo sum up, we can state at this juncture that the\nessential lesson we have drawn from this period of transition\nis that - in spite of undeniable difficulties - there is no\nturning back. We shall respect and follow the irreversible\nchoice of the Romanian people to join the family of\ndemocratic nations.\nIn our view, democracy and the new role of the United\nNations are not only complementary, but mutually\nstrengthening. In this respect, I should like to quote\nPresident Woodrow Wilson in his Address to the United\nStates Congress on 2 April 1917, as follows:\n(spoke in English)\n\\\"A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained\nexcept by a partnership of democratic nations. No\nautocratic Government could be trusted to keep faith\nwithin it or observe its covenant. It must be a league\nof honour, a partnership of opinions\\\".\n(spoke in French)\nThese ideas are still valid, and constitute precisely the\nobjective we must strive for, devoting all our efforts to\nstrengthening and giving new substance to the role of the\nUnited Nations. While remaining loyal to its basic\nprinciples and goals, the Organization must naturally adapt\nto the new political climate. Deeply and sincerely\ncommitted to the spirit of the United Nations Charter,\nRomania intends to support fully the ideas and\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s report\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". In so doing, my country regards\nthe United Nations, as described in the report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations,\n\\\"as the instrument of the body of Member States,\nand ... as more than the sum of its parts.\\\" (A/48/1,\npara. 512)\nMindful that implementing the lofty ideals of the United\nNations requires adequate resources, we are ready to support\nfully every effort to make better use of resources, with the\ncontributing nations having stricter control. Firm measures\nare needed. Accountability must become the watchword\nboth for the Organization\u2019s daily work and for its future\nprojects.\nEnlargement and diversification of programmes for\neconomic and social development and for protection of the\nenvironment are imperative. It is, however, important to\nmake sure that money allocated to these programmes is not\nwasted on piles of paper and unnecessary travels around the\nworld.\nPeace-keeping operations, which have undergone such\nan impressive expansion in recent years, have similar\nrequirements. Increased attention should be given to the\nratio of costs to benefits and control of the use of resources.\nThe new political climate, which has brought an\nenhanced role for the Security Council, has made possible a\nmore effective use of the United Nations potential for\ncontrolling and resolving conflicts.\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nRomania is determined to contribute to the best of its\nability to United Nations peace-keeping operations, and to\nthis end has already started a special programme to increase\nits capacity to respond adequately to the requirements of the\nOrganization or of other institutions. A first battalion of\nprofessional military personnel is already being trained for\nsuch operations; we estimate that it could become\noperational at the beginning of next spring.\nGiven the need to enhance the capacity of the United\nNations in this dynamic exercise of its functions, the support\nand cooperation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe\nare all the more needed and welcomed. In this regard, the\ncontributions of other regional agreements and organizations,\nand particularly the praiseworthy work carried out by the\nNorth Atlantic Cooperation Council, are of great importance.\nAt the same time, in order to preserve the prestige and\ncredibility of peacekeeping operations and to ensure the\nconfidence of the international community, such operations\nmust strictly observe the principles and premises which have\ncontributed to their success thus far. Therefore, we must be\ncautious in granting any unilateral authority that some\ncountries might be tempted to assume in areas where they\nhave special interests. This applies especially when there are\ndoubts about the impartiality of forces involved, or when the\nnecessary consent of the host country may be prejudiced by\nany kind of pressure.\nWisdom and caution are all the more necessary in this\nrespect, since we recognize the United Nations\npeace-keeping operations as an important dimension of a\nfuture new world order.\nHuman beings and their creative potential must always\nremain the central focus of all our endeavours. We welcome\nthe encouraging results of the World Conference on Human\nRights, and we hope that these conclusions, including those\nconcerning the creation of a post of High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, will be implemented as soon as possible.\nWe also hope that the World Summit on Social\nDevelopment, to be held in 1995, will be even more\nsuccessful.\nI am very pleased to reaffirm that respect for the human\nperson has become a generally accepted norm in our strategy\nfor social development. Romania is now a party to almost\nall the major international agreements on human rights and\nis engaged with all openness in the relevant international\nprocedures.\nInternational commitments to uphold human rights and\nthe rule of law are closely linked to national legislation\nthrough a constitutional clause that enshrines the primacy of\ninternational regulations over domestic law. The admission\nof Romania as a member of the Council of Europe, as was\nrecommended earlier today by an overwhelming majority in\nthe Council\u2019s parliamentary assembly, will complete this\npicture. In short, international standards and norms are at\nthe same time our standards and norms.\nCertainly, progress, particularly in the field of human\nrights, is not just a matter of drafting and passing new laws\nand regulations: it is also a matter of their implementation\nin a social environment. No less important is the economic\naspect. Standards of living and quality of life have a\nconsiderable impact on human rights. That is why we are\nstriving to make social protection a basic dimension of our\nreform programme.\nThe protection of the rights of people belonging to\nethnic minorities is an integral part of the protection of\nhuman rights. In Romania there are 14 national and ethnic\nminorities registered as such through their political parties or\norganizations. All together they represent about 10 per cent\nof the population. Since 1989 we have been making steady\nefforts to institute measures to protect the rights of persons\nbelonging to national minorities.\nThe establishment this year of the National Council of\nMinorities broadened the institutional framework, enabling\neach and every national minority in Romania to take part in\nthe decision-making process regarding the protection of their\nethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity. It is true\nthat we have not responded completely to all their demands\nand aspirations. The explanation for this lies, not in a lack\nof will, but in the difficulties confronting the entire\npopulation.\nYet we would underline that the excessive use of\nminority-related issues is harmful to the interests of\nminorities themselves, those of the majority of the\npopulation, and those of the international community as a\nwhole. Unfortunately, such tendencies, expressing\naggressive nationalism as well as xenophobia, racism and\nanti-Semitism, are still significant destabilizing factors and\na threat to international peace and security in Eastern and\nCentral Europe as elsewhere. Caution is therefore needed in\ndealing with these phenomena, as well as with the so-called\nnew concept of the right to self-determination, in order to\nprevent any debasement of its legal content.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23\nThe Romanian delegation would like to avail itself of\nthis opportunity to reaffirm its great satisfaction over the\nIsraeli-Palestinian declaration of principles on Palestinian\nself-rule in Gaza and Jericho, signed on 13 September 1993\nin Washington, D.C. In the view of the Romanian\nGovernment, their mutual recognition and the declaration of\nprinciples represent a triumph of the reason and political will\nof both the Israeli Government and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization, thus opening up new possibilities for peaceful\ncoexistence and collaboration, not only between their two\npeoples, but among all the peoples in the region. The lion\u2019s\nshare of the credit certainly goes to the two parties directly\ninvolved, but we cannot overlook the contribution of the\ninternational community, of the United States Government,\nand of the Governments of other countries. In this\nconnection, I am very pleased to recall the constant efforts\ndeployed by my country for peace and understanding\nbetween the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.\nWith regard to the conflict in the eastern region of the\nRepublic of Moldova, the conclusions expressed last year by\nthe Romanian delegation are, unfortunately, still valid in\nlarge part. No progress whatsoever has been made towards\nthe political solution of the conflict. Moreover, we are\nwitnessing a strange situation in which the commander-in-\nchief of the 14th Russian army - a foreign army on the\nnational soil of an independent country without the consent\nof that United Nations Member - was recently \\\"elected\\\" as\na member of the so-called local parliament.\nIn our opinion, the withdrawal of foreign troops is the\nkey to the solution of the conflict in the Transdniestr area.\nWe note with full satisfaction that a similar viewpoint is\nshared by the international community. A resolute\naffirmation of this position at the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly would be instrumental in upholding the\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic of\nMoldova. The recent positive developments on the\nwithdrawal of the Russian troops from the Baltic countries,\nan item which is to be debated at the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly, could serve as a useful precedent.\nWithin the same framework we should like to\nacknowledge the efforts of the mission of the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and to assure it\nof our full support for the accomplishment of its tasks. We\nfavour the resumption of the quadripartite mechanism of\nmeetings between the Ministers of Foreign Affairs from the\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation and\nUkraine.\nThe Republic of Moldova needs both the understanding\nand the support of the international community. A very\npromising sign in this respect is the prompt international\nreaction to the so-called trial in Tiraspol, where a group of\npersons was detained for political reasons by the\nself-proclaimed authorities of Transdniestr. Their lives are\nstill in danger. This trial reveals the political nature of the\nconflict in the Republic of Moldova.\nDespite the energetic diplomatic efforts made to date,\nthe conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are far from being\nresolved. As a neighbour and friend to all the successor\nStates, Romania is genuinely interested to see the earliest\npossible resumption of normal life in that region. Putting an\nend to the sufferings of the people and to the continual life-\nthreatening risks to the lives of the members of the United\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is an immediate\nimperative.\nRomania reiterates its great appreciation of the constant\nefforts deployed by the two Co-Chairmen of the Peace\nConference on Yugoslavia. In this context we should stress\nthe Romanian Government\u2019s commitment to continuing its\nefforts for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav conflict and\nits support for the peace process co-sponsored by the United\nNations and the European Community.\nConvinced that a negotiated peace is the only\nacceptable solution to the conflict, Romania will add its\ndiplomatic efforts to those of other countries in the region.\nThe success of our joint efforts is vital for the new Europe\nwe wish to build and for the future stability of the region.\nIn the context of the Yugoslav crisis, Romania complies\nstrictly with the sanctions regime imposed by the relevant\nSecurity Council\u2019s resolutions. Despite painful effects on\nour economy in the midst of a period of crisis and transition,\nwe consider these measures a necessary means of supporting\nthe peace-seeking efforts.\nThe presence of European Economic Community and\nCSCE sanctions assistance missions and of a small Western\nEuropean Union fleet that is patrolling the Romanian sector\nof the river has tightened the already-existing monitoring\nmechanisms. We have also engaged in close coordination\nwith the other riparian countries.\nNotwithstanding these efforts, we have not received\nsuitable compensation to defray our tremendous economic\nlosses. We are certainly encouraged by the increasing\nawareness on the part of the international community and the\nSecurity Council, in the spirit of Article 50 of the United\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNations Charter, with respect to the difficulties being\nexperienced by Romania and other affected countries. We\nshould like, however, to see this spirit given material form.\nThe United Nations bodies and international financial\ninstitutions should respond to the needs of our countries\nrather than leave us to fend for ourselves in seeking\nsolutions to the burdensome difficulties we face as a result\nof acting as loyal Members of the United Nations.\nWe welcome the serious debate in various United\nNations bodies on the issue of compensations. The\nrecommendations adopted by the Committee of the Security\nCouncil established under resolution 724 (1991) express\ngenuine moral support and solidarity. Unfortunately, we\nmust accept the fact that moral support is not enough; we\ncannot face serious economic needs with nothing more than\nfine words. We await strengthened consultative mechanisms\nfor considering concrete solutions to these problems, and we\nhope that the international financial institutions will be more\nreceptive.\nThis would bring well-deserved assistance to the\naffected countries, while at the same time increasing\nconfidence in the authority of the United Nations Charter\nand its ability to preserve the dedication of countries to the\ncause of peace.\nWe believe that the end of the cold war will result in\nnew general and specific duties for the members of the\ninternational community. If our common goals as Members\nof the United Nations are democracy, peace and security,\nthen solidarity is an essential means of achieving those\ngoals. One of the most original contributions the United\nNations could make during the current United Nations\nDecade of International Law would be to define the legal\ncontent of the \\\"duty of solidarity\\\" which should be\nimplemented in consonance with the universally accepted\nprinciples of jus gentium, democracy and human rights. In\nour view solidarity should become one of the central\nstrategic values of the new world order.\nUndoubtedly we still live in a time of great challenges\nfor the world community and the United Nations. Though\nit is true that many of the great expectations raised by the\nend of the cold war have not yet been fulfilled, we should\nnot give up hope. The best way to turn hope into reality is\nto work together, leaving both unfruitful habits and selfish\nconsiderations behind us. Our joint efforts must, above all,\nbe an expression of a vital, powerful solidarity and of\nconfidence in what we can do together for a better\ntomorrow.\n"

        "file_text": "In joining my colleagues\nin congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the high and\nresponsible office of President of the General Assembly, I\nshould like to point out that it is a great honour for a\npolitician and diplomat to guide the work of this universal\nforum representing practically all the States of the world. I\nhope that your activities in this important position will\npromote substantive discussions at this session and the\nadoption of constructive decisions, and that the work of the\nforty-eighth session will become a memorable page in your\nbiography.\nAt the same time, I should like to thank Mr. Ganev,\nPresident of the previous session of the General Assembly,\nfor his contribution to the Assembly\u2019s work.\nSoon we shall commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Teheran Conference, whose decisions laid down the\nfoundations of the United Nations. It was 50 years ago that\nthe participants in that Conference, while discussing the\nissue of creating an international organization, expressed\nconfidence that the accord among them would ensure lasting\npeace, and declared the lofty responsibility of all the United\nNations in safeguarding peace for succeeding generations.\nAs long ago as 1918, an outstanding Ukrainian\npolitician and writer, Mikhail Hrushevskiy, stated that\n\\\"Properly creating history is more important than depicting\nit positively\\\".\nWe are proud of the fact that Ukraine took an active\npart in laying down the foundation of the Organization and\nthat today, along with other members of the international\ncommunity, it is making a worthy contribution to attaining\nthe noble goals of the United Nations. To our mind, the\nmajor result of nearly 50 years of the Organization\u2019s\nexistence is the fact that world war has been averted. This\nis to the credit of the United Nations, a universal forum of\nStates, a unique Organization without which it is impossible\nto imagine present-day international relations.\nToday, when the new dominant feature of international\nrelations is the transition from bipolarity to a qualitatively\ndifferent world order based on comprehensive security and\na balance of interests, the world is witnessing the second\nbirth of the United Nations. For Ukraine, it is of special\nsignificance that the United Nations renaissance coincides\nwith the building of our independence, our regained\nstatehood and the revival of Ukraine as a sovereign\nparticipant in European and world politics.\nFor Ukraine, which today is trying to find its place in\nthe world balance of power, its United Nations membership\nis one of the most important international guarantees of its\nnational security and independence. After the disintegration\nof the USSR and the disappearance of the Warsaw Treaty\nOrganization, our country is compelled to exist next to a\nzone of decreased stability and of alienation and even\ntension, irrespective of who is the initiator and what is the\nsubject of discord. Ukraine finds itself in the epicentre of\nalmost all European developments: every crisis emerging on\nthe continent may affect us in one way or another.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThese factors led to the initiative by Mr. Leonid\nKravchuk, the President of Ukraine, concerning the creation\nin the Central and East European region of a space of\nstability and security which would include all countries in\nthe Baltic and Black Sea zone and that would become, in the\nfuture, an integral part of the European system of security.\nAt the same time, this Central and East European space of\nstability and security would be a reliable link for developing\na broad-based transatlantic system of security taking in the\narea from Vancouver to Vladivostok, that is, the whole\nregion covered by the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE). Implementation of this idea\nwould be a worthy contribution to preventive diplomacy.\nThe basic prerequisite for the creation of such a space\nmight be the implementation of the principle of security for\noneself through security for all, the main goal of which\nwould be the development of a system of international\nrelations in the region that would rule out threats to peace\nand stability such as those emanating from the present\nconflicts on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and\nUSSR.\nUkraine is capable of playing a constructive role in the\nformation of such a system. As a State which is situated in\nthe centre of the European continent and possesses vast\nhuman resources and scientific potential and a strong\nindustrial and agricultural complex, Ukraine is ready to\ncontribute more to the formation of a new, prosperous\nEurope. In accordance with the principles of a new Europe,\nwe aspire to build a democratic State of law that is\neconomically strong, politically active, peaceful and, in the\nfuture, non-nuclear along with others, in which individual\nrights are respected and guaranteed regardless of nationality\nor other distinctions.\nIn this context, I should like to dwell on the problem of\nnuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine. As is well\nknown, we inherited from the former USSR a huge nuclear\narsenal, the third largest in the world in terms of its combat\npotential. The declaration on the State sovereignty of\nUkraine proclaimed the intention of our State to become\nnon-nuclear in the future.\nAnd this is not a mere declaration. Ukraine is doing as\nmuch as it can towards its implementation. The dismantling\nof the strategic missile complexes has started. An agreement\nhas been signed with Russia on the utilization of the\nstrategic missiles\u2019 nuclear warheads. We do not exclude the\npossibility of conducting negotiations on this subject with a\nthird party.\nHowever, the full-scale implementation of the nuclear\ndisarmament programme is linked to the need to solve a\nnumber of problems. Where do we get the money to\ndismantle and eliminate the strategic nuclear weapons\nlocated in Ukraine? According to our estimates,\napproximately $2.8 billion are needed for these purposes.\nHow do we ensure reliable guarantees of national security\nfor our State?\nThere arises also the problem of returning to Ukraine -\nor obtaining compensation for - nuclear components,\nobtained from nuclear warheads, which, after reprocessing,\ncan be used as fuel for nuclear power stations. This also\napplies to the nuclear materials extracted from the warheads\nof tactical missiles removed from Ukraine in 1992.\nAnd finally, what should the thousands of servicemen\ndismissed from the missile forces do? We have no complete\nanswers to these and other questions; so far the promises of\nhelp exist only in statements and on paper.\nThe Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, is\ndeeply involved in these questions and is looking for\nopportunities to adopt balanced decisions, in the shortest\npossible time, taking into consideration the interests both of\nUkraine and of the international community as a whole.\nAt the same time, I should like to stress that while\nconsidering this issue we should also take into account the\nexternal situation. For today, instability and internal\nstruggles in neighbouring countries sometimes spill over\ntheir frontiers and threaten Ukraine\u2019s national security and\nterritorial integrity. This is most especially so in the case of\nthe well-known decision by the, now former, Supreme\nSoviet of the Russian Federation concerning the status of\nSevastopol. There have also been attempts to question the\nstatus of Crimea as a whole. In this connection, I should\nlike to state explicitly that the Republic of Crimea is an\ninseparable part of Ukraine. Crimea, as a part of Ukraine,\ncould play an appropriate role in the region and make a\ndecisive contribution to consolidating the Black Sea region\nas a zone of peace and stability. In this context, I should\nlike to express profound gratitude to all the countries,\nespecially to the members of the Security Council, that gave\ntheir unambiguous assessment of the illegal encroachments\nupon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and\nmanifested their support for our State. Again, we are\nconvinced that the complicated issues of inter-State relations\ncan be solved only through firm and energetic action on the\npart of the international community.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7\nIn our opinion, the objective basis for cooperation\nbetween Ukraine and other countries lies in the formation of\na stable and secure system of international relations. In the\npresent circumstances, the basis of this system is respect for\nthe principal postulates of international law, according to\nwhich the inviolability of the frontiers and territorial integrity\nof sovereign States is recognized as one of the prerequisites\nfor international peace and security. The former empires\nhave vanished, and like them imperialistic thinking, such as\nunilateral interpretations by certain States of legal succession\nissues and their other actions that are incompatible with the\nnorms and ethics of international relations should also\ndisappear.\nWe hope that an understanding of contemporary\nrealities will facilitate the further normalization and\ndevelopment of Ukraine\u2019s relations with other countries on\nterms of mutual respect, a balanced search for compromises\nand the renunciation of extreme rhetoric. Genuine\nconditions for such developments are already in existence,\nand it is a worthwhile task to use them to foster mutually\nbeneficial economic relations and to ensure wide-ranging\ncontacts between peoples.\nUkraine, as one of the founders of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States, is actively developing cooperation\nwith the CIS countries. We regard the Commonwealth as an\ninternational mechanism for multilateral consultations and\ntalks that is contributing to the process of forming\nqualitatively new full-scale, bilateral relations between\nparticipating States and is promoting solutions to the\nproblems that they face after the disintegration of the USSR.\nOur relations with the Baltic States are developing in a\npositive way.\nUkraine unswervingly supports the efforts of the world\ncommunity to find a formula for settling the conflict in the\nformer Yugoslavia. We consider that a real solution to this\nproblem is possible only through taking into account the\ninterests of all States in the region, and those of ethnic\ncommunities, on the basis of the relevant decisions by the\nUnited Nations Security Council and of the cornerstone\nprinciples of international law.\nWe take it as given that all countries involved in the\nattempt to settle this conflict, and the relevant international\nstructures, must approach the issue very carefully, especially\nwhen the use of force is implied. It must be borne in mind\nthat the use of force might lead to extremely undesirable\nconsequences, frustrate the negotiating process and result in\nan escalation in the conflict and its spread to other areas of\nthe former Yugoslavia.\nOur position on the settlement of conflicts on the\nterritory of the former Soviet Union is similar. In this\nconnection, we should like to welcome the role played by\nthe United Nations and the CSCE in Transdnestria and the\njoint efforts of the international community in searching for\nways to stop the bloodshed in Nagorny-Karabakh.\nTragic developments have taken place in Georgia.\nSigned agreements have been violated, the bloodshed persists\nand people continue to perish. As long ago as\n21 September, Leonid Kravchuk, the President of Ukraine,\nappealed to the President of the Russian Federation, which\nis a guarantor of the tripartite truce agreement of\n27 July 1993, and to the Secretary-General of the United\nNations to take all possible measures to stop the escalation\nof the conflict and to activate the mechanism contained in\nthe agreement. Regrettably, the attempts to stop the\ndangerous developments have been frustrated and the\nsituation is running out of control, threatening the stability\nof the Caucasus region as a whole. The international\ncommunity should immediately call on the potential of the\nUnited Nations Charter in order to bring the situation back\nonto a course of settlement through political dialogue.\nAt the same time, I should like to draw attention to a\ntruth that is as old as the hills but which is regrettably often\nforgotten: preventing disease is much cheaper and more\neffective than treating them. A similar idea was expressed\nyesterday by Mr. Kinkel, my colleague from Germany. An\nemphasis on active, preventive diplomacy that would\nforestall conflicts should become the dominant feature of\ncontemporary international relations. The fact that the issue\nof Sevastopol was addressed at a meeting of the United\nNations Security Council, the activities of the CSCE\nmissions in Kosovo, Sanjak and Vojvodina, and the\ndeployment of United Nations military contingents in The\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are, to our mind,\ngood examples that illustrate this truth.\nIn fact, reviving the peacemaking activities of the\nUnited Nations has become one of the more vivid examples\nof the transformation in United Nations political thinking,\nand is embodied in the conclusion that diplomatic language\nshould replace the language of the gun in inter-State\ncommunication.\nUkraine is taking an active part in this process. More\nthan a year has elapsed since a Ukrainian battalion was sent\nto the former Yugoslavia to participate in the United Nations\npeace-keeping forces. From the point of view of Ukraine,\nas a new and independent State, the multilateral peace-\nkeeping efforts of the United Nations remain the\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nOrganization\u2019s most effective instruments in its performance\nof its major function, the ensuring of international peace and\nsecurity. Ukraine is ready to continue active participation in\nthe peace-keeping activities carried out under the auspices of\nthe United Nations or the CSCE.\nThe prestige and authority that Ukraine has gained as\na result of its participation in United Nations peace-keeping\noperations have not come easily. Lately, human losses\namong peace-keepers from the United Nations Blue Helmets\nhave increased. The rise in the number of peace-keeping\noperations and their expansion may result in further losses.\nThat is why it is our belief that it is urgently necessary to\nwork out a document to define the status of United Nations\npeace-keeping personnel and to make provision for a\nmechanism to protect them. This would be a logical\ndevelopment of the provisions of resolution 47/72, adopted\nby the General Assembly at the initiative of Ukraine, with\nsponsorship by over 50 States, and of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolution, resolution 868 (1993) of\n29 September 1993.\nUkraine is interested in strengthening peace, security\nand stability in the nearby Middle East region and welcomes\nthe decisions reached between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization on mutual recognition and the\nagreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza strip and\nJericho signed on 13 September in Washington. The first,\nimportant step has thus been taken on the road to a complete\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nUkraine welcomes the developments in South Africa,\nwhich make it possible to lift economic sanctions against\nthat country. We hope that wisdom and a balanced approach\nby all the participants in the negotiating process in that\ncountry, and active work on the part of the Transitional\nExecutive Council, will become a solid basis for the\nsuccessful holding of elections and the formation of a\ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa.\nOur State is paying great attention to the experience of\nthe countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The extraordinarily\nfast pace of developments in some of the countries in this\nregion is evidence of the effectiveness of pragmatic\napproaches to solving complex political, economic and social\nissues.\nThe process of a practical development of relations with\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\ncountries has been initiated. We see this grouping as\npotentially one of the best trade and economic partners for\nUkraine, inasmuch as trade between the ASEAN States - and\nthe region as a whole - and the countries of Eastern and\nCentral Europe flows through Ukrainian ports.\nWe shall facilitate by all possible means the\ndevelopment, and the maintenance on the proper level, of\nrelations with the States of Europe, North and South\nAmerica, the Middle East and Africa.\nI should like to dwell briefly on the present-day\nsituation in Ukraine. Frankly, we are experiencing difficult\ntimes now. In addition to the establishment of our own\nState and the rebirth of our national culture and spirit, we\nare undergoing a transformation to a new system with new\ncivic and economic parameters. Our scholars, specialists and\nstatesmen have not yet succeeded in proposing a programme\nof economic reforms in keeping with Ukraine\u2019s real\npotential, its historical traditions and the mind-set of its\npeople. And now we have to make major adjustments to the\nprocedure and sequence of the reform process.\nOur goal is a market, socially-oriented economic\nsystem, directed at meeting the needs of our people. It\nshould take into account economic interrelations that were,\nobjectively, formed in the CIS, opportunities for foreign\ninvestment in our economy, and a step-by-step integration of\nthe Ukrainian economy into that of the European Community\nand the world.\nImportant steps have been taken in this regard. By\nadopting a law on ownership, the Verkhovna Rada has\nopened the road to privatization as the principal means for\nthe transition to market-based economic relations. Important\ndocuments have been approved concerning the\ndenationalization and privatization of enterprises, land and\nhousing. Ukraine has declared its intention to become an\nassociate member of the CIS economic union, and is\nengaged in active negotiations within the framework of the\nCommission of the European Communities.\nHowever, the situation in the State remains extremely\ncomplicated.\nIn overcoming the crisis, the international community,\nincluding our compatriots abroad - the representatives of the\nUkrainian diaspora - could play an important role. Our\nlegislation sets out favourable conditions for foreign\ninvestment in the Ukrainian economy, and a number of\nmeasures have been adopted concerning participation by our\nState in the European and world communities and the\ndevelopment of bilateral trade and economic relations.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9\nIt is important to find areas that could appeal to our\npartners and to proceed to develop and implement specific\ncooperation programmes and projects. An example of this\nkind of cooperation can be seen in the activities that we have\ninitiated with Commission of the European Communities and\nin the framework of the Black Sea economic cooperation.\nWe are also ready to participate actively in carrying out\nthe economic programmes being implemented within the\nframework of the United Nations.\nIn this context, we are heartened by the increasing\nattention being paid by the United Nations and its bodies and\nby the economically developed countries to the processes of\ntransition to the market economy being undertaken in the\nEastern and Central European States. Favourable conditions\nfor broadening cooperation between the United Nations and\nStates with economies in transition, including Ukraine, have\nopened up as a result of the formation of integrated missions\nby the United Nations and the United Nations Development\nProgramme in this field. We hope that these missions will\nbe given permanent status.\nWe place great hope in assistance by the international\ncommunity in mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyl\ndisaster. I must say that after the appointment of United\nNations Under-Secretary-General Mr. Eliasson as the United\nNations Coordinator of International Cooperation for\nChernobyl, activities in this area have acquired new impetus.\nI hope his efforts will find support in the General Assembly\nand will contribute to strengthening international cooperation\nfor this purpose.\nIn addition to the expenditures needed to mitigate the\nafter-effects of the Chernobyl disaster, which account for a\nconsiderable part of the national income, the losses resulting\nfrom the imposition of economic sanctions by the Security\nCouncil against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have\nbecome another great negative factor for our economy.\nConsequently, by the end of 1993, Ukraine will have\nsuffered direct losses of more than $4 billion in the State\nsector alone.\nToday we need real efforts on the part of the\ninternational community to assist Ukraine in overcoming the\nnegative impact of the sanctions against the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia on Ukraine\u2019s economy as well as on the\neconomies of a number of other countries. Our delegation\nis ready to propose a draft resolution which would deal with\nthe implementation of the relevant recommendations of the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\nRegretfully, the serious economic difficulties associated\nwith the factors that I have mentioned were not taken into\nconsideration when the international community last year\nadopted the decision, contrary to the provisions of the United\nNations Charter, to increase Ukraine\u2019s contribution to the\nUnited Nations regular budget by 58 per cent. The\nassessment imposed on Ukraine is not fully commensurate\nwith its capacity to pay, and is a great burden on its\neconomy. As a result of great efforts, this year we have\nmanaged to contribute $6.5 million to the United Nations\nregular budget, which otherwise could have been directed at\nsolving the problems caused by Chernobyl. However, we\ncannot meet our financial obligations in full, for the reasons\nI have mentioned.\nIn this context, the Government of Ukraine urges a\nreconsideration of the scale of assessments for the United\nNations regular budget and an amendment of the existing\nsystem of financing United Nations peace-keeping\noperations. Our delegation is ready to offer grounds for this\nposition during discussion of the relevant items by the Fifth\nCommittee.\nThe world has experienced great changes since the\nfoundation of the United Nations. This is understandable,\nfor, as Heraclitus said, \\\"Nothing endures but change\\\". That\nis why the issue of reforming the United Nations system is\na quite natural one. Current realities raise new problems for\nthe world community. Even though the danger of a global\nnuclear conflict has been practically eliminated, the \\\"local\\\"\nwars and regional conflicts breaking out all over the world\nare causing serious concern.\nInterethnic armed conflicts and economic instability\ncreate favourable grounds for terrorism, the arms trade and\nthe production and trafficking of drugs, and directly affect\nthe security of United Nations Member States. The\nChernobyl nuclear power station disaster, the environmental\ndisorder in the Aral Sea area, the danger of an ecological\ncatastrophe as a result of destruction of tropical forests and\nthe depletion of the Earth\u2019s ozone layer are but a very\nincomplete list of the ecological problems facing mankind.\nThe need for change is also becoming especially urgent\nand even inevitable as a result of the significant events of\nthe past few years that have radically redrawn the political\nmap of the world; more than two dozen new independent\nStates have emerged, thus considerably increasing the United\nNations family. Let me extend to them my sincere\ncongratulations.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nUkraine shares the view that the present quantitative\ncomposition of the Security Council, its functioning and its\nworking methods require appropriate adjustments, taking into\nconsideration the new regional realities and the appearance\nof new participants in the international community.\nImplementing this proposal would increase the Council\u2019s\ndegree of legitimacy as the body that is entrusted by the\nUnited Nations Member States with the principal\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\nsecurity. At the same time, it is important to preserve the\nCouncil\u2019s ability to respond effectively to emergencies that\nrequire prompt intervention.\nIn changing the structure of the United Nations Security\nCouncil, it is very important to take into account the\nexistence, beyond its present membership, of participants in\nthe international community that are potentially capable of\nplaying an important role in the Organization\u2019s activities at\nthe present time and that have substantial financial\nobligations to the United Nations. It is also very important\nto preserve in the Security Council the basic principle of\nequitable geographic representation.\nThe working methods of the most representative United\nNations body - the General Assembly - also require\nmodification. It is in our interest to direct its activities, to\nthe maximum possible extent, towards further consolidating\nthe principles of justice, democracy and development. The\ndelegation of Ukraine supports the decisions of the forty-\nseventh session aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the\nGeneral Assembly and at rationalizing the work of its Main\nCommittees.\nWe are ready for further dialogue on the issues\nconcerning structural changes in the sessional and subsidiary\nbodies of the General Assembly. This means, in particular,\nfurther decreasing the number of resolutions that are\nrepeated and duplicated from year to year and redistributing\nthe functions of subsidiary bodies.\nIn our view, the reform should also involve the\nactivities of the main economic and social forum of the\nUnited Nations, the Economic and Social Council, and\nshould also be reflected in the structure and working\nmethods of the Organization\u2019s Secretariat. Ukraine fully\nsupports the actions of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the\nSecretary-General, aimed at extending the reforms in the\nSecretariat, and who is acting firmly in order to increase\nthe role and authority of the Organization, in keeping with\nthe requirements of the time. We are facing the task of\nreorienting the United Nations social and economic activities\nin order to implement specific projects in the interest of all\nStates, including those now on the way to the free market.\nFor the reforms to be successful, it is also important to\nensure, in practice, real zero growth in the Organization\u2019s\nbudget, and the effective use of its financial assets by\nreorientating them towards priority fields of activity.\nThe United Nations will soon mark its fiftieth\nanniversary. This jubilee is a special date in the calendar of\ninternational life, but, moreover, it will be celebrated at the\nturn of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is well\nknown that all historic dates look towards the future.\nTherefore, the best way to celebrate this anniversary is to\nconcentrate on outstanding issues, analyse the emerging\nsituation and determine what the prospects are for future\ndevelopment. That is why, perhaps, it is time for the world\ncommunity to get together, as it did after the world wars,\nand creatively reappraise the realities of the\npost-confrontational period and, where necessary, amend\nexisting structures of security and cooperation and division\nof labour in order to determine the world order for the\ntwenty-first century. These are the considerations that\nimpelled President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine to initiate\nthe idea of convening, within the framework of the United\nNations fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995, a global\ninternational peace summit conference.\nIn advancing the idea of holding such an event under\nthe auspices of the United Nations, we take it as given that\nthis is the Organization that can convene global conferences\nof Ministers and Heads of States or Governments in order to\nweigh up complex issues and suggest comprehensive\nsolutions. Therefore, all our thoughts today are directed\ntowards tomorrow, to which we should come having\ndiscarded the heavy burden of the confrontational era and\nhaving drawn upon the best of the Organization\u2019s past\nactivities, which have enriched us with invaluable\nknowledge. From the collective wisdom manifested in the\nactivities of the United Nations, we can tap the optimism so\nnecessary for mankind today, and the faith in its positive\nstrength and in its future.\nIn conclusion, I should like to cite some words by\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, which he\npronounced during his recent visit to Ukraine:\n\\\"Deep involvement in the great currents of history\ngives Ukraine a special insight into the world today. It\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11\nqualifies Ukraine to play a full role in the new United\nNations.\\\"\nI wish to assure you that Ukraine will spare no effort in\ncontinuing to prove the rightness of his words.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to\ncongratulate you, Sir, most warmly on your unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations at its forty-eighth session. We are familiar\nwith your great diplomatic skills and your patience and\nperseverance and therefore feel certain that you will guide\nthe work of this session towards a successful conclusion.\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nI would also like to convey our wholehearted\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization,\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the tireless\nand efficient efforts he has exerted in discharging his\nimportant responsibilities over the past year. We wish him\nevery success in the accomplishment of his complex and\ndifficult tasks at the head of our Organization.\nThe Lao delegation also extends a welcome to the\nStates that have recently become Members of the United\nNations: the Principality of Andorra, Eritrea, The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Principality of\nMonaco, the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.\nTheir presence among us certainly enhances the universality\nof the United Nations.\nThe present session of the General Assembly has begun\nat a time when the international situation as a whole is\nevolving in a positive direction, conducive both to dialogue\nand to cooperation between States. None the less, the\ngenuine peace that peoples the world over have so long\nawaited has not been attained. From East to West, from\nNorth to South, sizeable and often tragic conflicts keep\nbreaking out. It is true that some of them have been\nsuccessfully resolved, but many others, of an ethnic, racial\nand religious nature, are arising in various parts of the world\nand are raging unabated, rendering the world situation fragile\nand precarious.\nIn Europe, the situation in the Republic of Bosnia\nremains tense and even explosive, and could threaten both\nregional and global peace and security. In flagrant defiance\nof international humanitarian law, crimes such as \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\", mass rapes, torture and deliberate bombing of\ncivilian targets continue to be committed against the innocent\nBosnian people. Given the gravity of the problem, all the\nparties to this painful conflict should show the courage and\nthe sense of realism necessary to reach a just and equitable\npolitical settlement freely and as quickly as possible, and\nthereby contribute to the restoration of peace, security and\nnormalcy in that country and in the entire region.\nIn South Africa, the conclusion of an agreement on the\ndate of the first multiracial elections and the establishment\nof the Transitional Executive Council constitute an important\nstage in the efforts of the people of that country to build a\nunited, democratic and non-racial South Africa.\nNevertheless, the overall situation in the country remains\nfragile. Sadly, we still witness an upsurge of acts of\nviolence and of discord in many parts of the country.\nTherefore, political, social and racial order must be restored\nso that the reforms thus begun can continue, at an\naccelerated pace.\nIn Somalia, the evolution of the situation is still\ndisquieting. It is vital that the international community find\njust and lasting solutions to this problem in accordance with\nthe rights and aspirations of the Somali people.\nIn the Middle East, an important step has been taken in\nthe quest for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of\nthe Israel-Arab conflict. The Lao delegation is pleased at\nthe mutual recognition between the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel, as well as the Gaza-Jericho\nautonomy agreement which was signed in Washington on 13\nSeptember 1993. We hope that that agreement will help the\nvarious parties to the conflict to establish a climate of\nmutual trust and in this way to find a comprehensive\nsettlement that is just and honourable for all, in the\nframework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions.\nIn western Asia, despite the signing last March at\nIslamabad of a peace agreement between the Afghan parties\nin conflict, Afghanistan remains the theatre of civil war. In\nthe interests of national concord among Afghans, of the\nreconstruction of their homeland and of the peace and\nsecurity of the entire region, we appeal to all the parties\nconcerned to put an end to their conflicts.\nOn the Korean peninsula, there is still an atmosphere of\nmutual distrust in the military sphere. We welcome the\ntireless efforts made by all the countries concerned,\nincluding the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to\nensure that the Korean peninsula is a nuclear-weapon-free\nzone. It would be in the highest interest of the entire north-\neast Asian region and of the world if peace, stability and\ncooperation were to be achieved.\nIn South-East Asia, the countries of the region generally\nenjoy good relations, and this is opening up a new era for\nthe broadening of their cooperation, day by day, in many\nfields of shared interest. For the first time my own country,\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, participated as an\nobserver in the Ministerial Meeting of the countries of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), held\nrecently in Singapore. We are pleased at this important\nmeeting with the countries of ASEAN which has given new\nimpetus to our joint efforts to promote cooperation in\ndifferent fields among the peoples of the region.\nOur delegation is also gratified by the historic events\nthat have taken place in Cambodia, our immediate\nneighbour. The promulgation of the new constitution by His\nMajesty King Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the\nestablishment of a new Government in that country will open\nthe way to peace, stability and national harmony, thus\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 13\ncontributing to the strengthening of cooperation and\nfriendship in the region.\nIn the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 1992 was a\nyear of many achievements. Our gross national product\nincreased by 7 per cent over 1991; our rate of inflation is 10\nper cent, compared to 14 per cent in 1991; and the rate of\nexchange in general has stabilized. In other words, the\nmulti-ethnic Lao people is seeing a gradual improvement in\nits standard of living. From a political standpoint, our\ncountry has experienced solid stability, and we intend\nvigorously to continue our effort to promote democracy and\nour people\u2019s collective decision-making power, in\naccordance with our country\u2019s historical and cultural realities\nand with its level of economic and social development.\nAt the beginning of 1993, the National Assembly\nendorsed our national plan for socio-economic development\nthrough the year 2000. Under this plan, the Lao\nGovernment has set for itself two major objectives.\nThe first is aimed at meeting the most urgent daily\nneeds of our population, especially of the ethnic minorities\nthat live in the mountainous regions; bringing about a\ngradual rise in their standard of living, both material and\ncultural; and ensuring political and social stability in the\ncountry.\nThe second is to promote the development of\nagriculture and forestry in concert with the development of\nservices and of industry, especially in the field of\nhydropower, one of the areas of potential growth in our\ncountry; to develop more forcefully our market economy,\ncreate internal savings, stabilize State finances and work\nsteadily towards financial autonomy; and to strengthen our\nefforts at development of human resources in order to create\nconditions conducive to national development in the\nimmediate future and for the years to come.\nIn order to realize this plan, we will endeavour to\nachieve an average growth rate of 8 per cent, to maintain\neconomic and financial balance, to preserve stability of\nprices and of rates of exchange, and to keep the inflation\nrate no higher than 10 per cent per year. The Government\nwill continue its policy of broadening cooperation with other\ncountries and in this regard hopes to have the support and\nassistance in all respects of the international community.\nAccording to the United Nations World Economic\nSurvey, production at the international level should increase\nby only 1.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1994,\ncompared with .6 per cent in 1992: a very weak recovery of\ngrowth in general terms. This weak recovery, especially in\nthe industrialized countries, entails a continued decline in the\ndemand for export goods from the developing countries and\na more abrupt decline in the prices of their raw materials,\nwhich are of vital importance to their economies. Bearing\nin mind the interdependence of the components of the global\neconomy, it would be wiser for the developed countries to\nattach greater importance to the developing countries and to\ncommit themselves truly to international cooperation founded\nupon revitalization of the economy and development in the\ninterests of all.\nThe problem of the environment, because of its\nimportance in its relation to development, is still at the\nforefront of global concerns. We are still witnessing the\npollution of our air, seas and oceans, abrupt climate changes,\na steady depletion of the ozone layer, and desertification in\nmany parts of the world. It is time for the developed\ncountries and the developing countries to strengthen their\ninternational cooperation effectively and to take forceful\nmeasures to protect the environment, in accordance with\ntheir respective responsibilities and capacities and with the\nwell-known Agenda 21, adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in\n1992.\nAs for the drug problem, my delegation is pleased that\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly will devote\nspecial meetings to this subject. We intend to contribute to\nits consideration in view of the importance of this problem\nand its implications in the world at large and in our own\ncountry.\nThe question of promoting human rights and\nfundamental freedoms still occupies a central place on the\ninternational agenda. Because it is so important and so\nsensitive, this question requires serious consideration on the\nbasis of the principles of non-selectivity, objectivity and\nimpartiality. To this we should add that the historic,\ncultural, political, social, economic and religious realities of\neach country need to be taken into account. From this\nstandpoint, we are on the whole satisfied with the results\nobtained at the recent World Conference on Human Rights,\nheld in Vienna, Austria, from 14 to 25 June 1993.\nWith the end of bipolarization, it is important that\nStates place their hopes in the United Nations, which is truly\nintended to be universal and institutional, capable of\nmaintaining international peace and security, of promoting\ndevelopment and of having law and justice prevail the world\nover. So that it can live up to its new responsibilities, the\nOrganization must also build its new structure. A\nrevitalized, restructured United Nations made more\ndemocratic in its decision-making process, particularly in the\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSecurity Council, will certainly be able to play its rightful\ncentral role in the management of international affairs.\nStates and peoples all over the world, large and small alike,\npowerful or weak, rich or poor, could benefit greatly from\nsuch a development.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey\nto the General Assembly greetings from the people and\nGovernment of Nepal and the best wishes of His Majesty\nKing Birenda Bir Bikram Shah Dev for the success of its\nforty-eighth session.\nAs I stand before members today, my thoughts go back\nto 1960, when the first elected Prime Minister of Nepal, the\nlate B.P. Koirala, addressed the Assembly and declared that\nthe foreign policy of Nepal was inspired by the purposes and\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 11\nprinciples of the United Nations. He said then that Nepal\nlooked upon the Organization as an instrument for promoting\npeace and justice among nations.\nThe late Prime Minister\u2019s visit to the United Nations\nwas an event of historic significance for Nepal. A\nrevolutionary transformation had then taken place in my\ncountry. As a result, a conscious and coherent foreign\npolicy, with centrality given to the principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations, had started to take shape.\nSimilar revolutionary changes again took place in my\ncountry in 1990, after a gap of more than three decades. In\naccordance with the wishes of our people, multiparty\ndemocracy has been restored in Nepal. Now there is a\nconstitutional guarantee of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms. As the second elected Prime Minister to address\nthis body, after 33 years, I must say that this moment has a\ndeep personal overtone for me.\nRestoration of multiparty democracy and respect for\nfundamental human rights does not necessarily mean that we\nhave solved all our problems. The expectations of the\npeople are naturally high, but the means at our disposal are\nextremely limited.\nFaced with such problems, my Government has been\nmaking every effort to ensure a better standard of living for\nour people in larger freedom. Our development plans are\nbased on the premise that it is the individual citizen and not\nthe State which has the right to development. Along with\neconomic liberalization, we are pursuing a people-oriented\ndevelopment policy focused on poverty alleviation. To\nachieve our goals we have increased investments in human-\npriority areas. Given the enormous constraints upon us,\nranging from lack of resources to the high cost of\ninfrastructure, a shortage of skilled personnel and\ninstitutional deficiencies, our problems are daunting. We\nlook forward to greater understanding from donor countries\nand multilateral agencies in helping us to implement our\npeople-oriented development programmes, in upgrading local\nskills and in building the capacity to accelerate human\ndevelopment.\nThe foreign policy of Nepal is guided by the objective\nof ensuring its sovereignty, political independence and\nnational security while promoting international peace and\ncooperation. Inspired by the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations, the policy of non-alignment, and respect for\nhuman rights, we seek friendship and cooperation with all\ncountries of the world, and in particular with our neighbours.\nWe have reason to be satisfied with the excellent relations\nwe enjoy with the countries in our immediate\nneighbourhood. We are partners with our friends in South\nAsia in an effort to forge a mutually beneficial scheme of\ncooperation for the welfare of our people under the aegis of\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.\nWith the sudden end of the cold war the world is at the\nthreshold of a new era of shared responsibility for global\npeace and development. The post-cold-war world is very\nmuch in need of order, but it is a world that cannot be\nordered by military and economic Powers alone. At this\ntime of historic transition, political leadership in all countries\nmust show a higher order of statesmanship. It is time to\nshed old prejudices and parochialism. We should be able to\npool the best of every civilization and culture for the greater\ngood of mankind.\nChanges in international relations have also created\nopportunities to devise new partnership in global\nresponsibility. The world today is poised to consider new\napproaches to international law based not on unilateralism\nbut on multilateralism. The United Nations is an\norganization of the powerful and the weak, the large and the\nsmall, the wealthy and the poor, each contributing its share\nto the common interest. It is in the interest of all to make\nthe United Nations an effective and influential agent of\nconstructive change in a turbulent world.\nIf the United Nations is to fulfil its Charter obligations\nit must deal with the root causes of conflicts and instability.\nThe mechanisms and processes at its disposal for achieving\nthat goal must be strengthened and refined. In this context,\nthere are four areas which demand immediate attention:\nfirst, international cooperation to combat poverty; secondly,\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security; thirdly,\nprogressive reduction and finally elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction and, fourthly, universalization of human\nrights.\nDemocracy and human rights are easily eroded when\nwidespread poverty prevails. Poverty undermines human\ndignity, contributes to environmental degradation and\nundermines the cohesion of a society. It also poses a lasting\nthreat to peace and stability. The search for collective\nsecurity cannot, therefore, be separated from the sustained\nefforts to improve the economic and social conditions of\npeoples everywhere. Agenda 21, adopted at the Rio\nConference on Environment and Development, is a\ncomprehensive blueprint for sustainable development. To\nturn that vision into reality there is an urgent need for\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nresumption of the North-South dialogue and for economic\ncooperation between developing nations.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nIn this context, I look forward to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s agenda for development. We sincerely\nhope that an agenda for development will form the basis of\naccelerating international cooperation to the mutual benefit\nof developed and developing countries alike. The upcoming\nInternational Conference on Population and Development,\nthe World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women should also be occasions to\nfocus on the human dimensions of socio-economic problems.\nIn speaking of social and economic issues, I recall the\ninitiative taken by countries of South Asia under the aegis of\nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to\nwork together for the cause of children. That initiative\nprovided the major motivation for the holding of the World\nSummit for Children. The mid-decade review in 1995 must\nbe an occasion to evaluate the implementation of the\npromises the international community made to children at\nthe World Summit. Despite conflicting demands on our\nlimited resources, we in Nepal are allocating an increasing\nportion of our national budget to child and maternal health\nand welfare and on other basic human-services areas. We\nare in favour of the proposal for matching resource\nallocations by donor countries for such national initiatives.\nThe dramatic increase in the demands on and\nheightened expectations of the United Nations is nowhere\nmore compelling than in the area of peace and security.\nWith experience spanning over 35 years in United Nations\nmissions, Nepal welcomes the expansion in the mandates of\npeace-keeping operations. The recent successes of the\nmissions in El Salvador and Cambodia are testimony to the\npotential of a United Nations operation with a clearly\ndefined and practicable mandate. The joint venture of the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States in\nHaiti is breaking newer ground in international cooperation\nto restore a democratically elected Government and to\nprotect and promote human rights.\nWithout minimizing the enormity of the problems the\nUnited Nations has to take into account in Somalia, I feel\nthat the emphasis on military action will overshadow the\nlarger goal of the mission in that country. I urge the\nredoubling of efforts to seek lasting political solutions to the\nproblems in Somalia.\nI appeal to the parties concerned in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina to respond immediately to the successive\nresolutions of the Security Council and halt the senseless\ncarnage of innocent people. The continuing tragedy in the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia presents a test-case for\nviable cooperation between the United Nations and regional\norganizations in the maintenance of peace and security.\nNepal will continue to support the further development\nof preventive diplomacy by the Secretary-General and the\nSecurity Council. In the maintenance of peace and security,\nthe implementation of enforcement measures under the\nCharter should be the step of last resort. It should be the\nexception to rather than the rule of the game. The real\nstrength of collective security lies in the ability to implement\nthe provisions of the Charter relating to peaceful settlement\nof disputes.\nThe grounds for the intervention of the Security\nCouncil have also raised questions of consistency. As the\nprincipal organ entrusted with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, the Council must act in an\neven-handed and impartial manner and must be perceived as\ndoing so.\nThe recent comments of the Secretary-General on the\nfinancial situation of the Organization should be a cause of\nconcern to all. Investments in peace-keeping, peacemaking\nand preventive diplomacy are investments in collective\nstability. It is not possible for the United Nations to play its\nrole without adequate resources.\nAlong with other non-aligned countries, Nepal has\nalways subscribed to the call for a more active United\nNations role in arms control and disarmament. Since mutual\nfear is the source of any arms race, confidence-building\nmeasures must be seriously pursued in order to achieve the\ngoals of disarmament. Nations should pursue a culture of\nensuring security at the lowest possible level of armaments.\nSuccesses in bilateral negotiations on nuclear weapons,\nconventional forces in Europe and chemical weapons prove\nthat it is a feasible goal.\nNepal deems it extremely significant that all five\nnuclear-weapon States are now parties to the nuclear\nnon-proliferation Treaty. We have long advocated an early\nconclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Meaningful\nprogress in this area will have important implications for the\nreview and extension Conference on the non-proliferation\nTreaty.\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 13\nProtection of human rights has emerged as an important\nfactor in the development of friendly relations among States.\nThe United Nations must spare no effort in establishing an\ninternational norm of human rights. The World Conference\non Human Rights was a major step in this direction. Human\nrights cannot be secure without a universal conscience on the\npart of all peoples to uphold each other\u2019s rights in full\nunderstanding of the just demands of the individual, the\ncommunity, the State and the international order. Human\nrights cannot be secured unless there is an absolute freedom\nfrom fear from any source. There is a direct correlation\nbetween the status of human rights, the democratic process\nand an evolution of a culture of peaceful settlement of\ndisputes. The threat to peace is the greatest when human\nrights are denied.\nThe world is at a vital turning-point. The old order has\ncome to an end while the new has yet to take shape. While\nsome old contradictions persist and new ones appear, some\nunexpected bright areas have also dawned. Nepal welcomes\nthe agreement reached by the negotiating parties in South\nAfrica to hold an election in April 1994. We share the deep\nconcern of the international community over the continued\nviolence which threatens the peaceful transition of South\nAfrica to a non-racial democratic society.\nNepal has long enjoyed friendship with both the Israeli\nand the Palestinian peoples. We welcome the Declaration of\nPrinciples as well as the exchange of letters of mutual\nrecognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO). The statesmanship shown by the\nleaders of Israel and the PLO promises a new beginning for\nthe Middle East and, indeed, the world. We earnestly hope\nthat this historic breakthrough will facilitate the search for a\ncomprehensive and lasting solution of the Middle East\nproblem.\nAs I come towards the end of my statement, I wish to\nextend to you, Sir, my hearty congratulations on your\nelection to the high office of President of the General\nAssembly at a time when the United Nations is passing\nthrough a very important phase in its history. I also take\nthis opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to\nMr. Stoyan Ganev for his stewardship of the forty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI must also take this opportunity to pay our warmest\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nHis efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nations with\nthe courage of conviction have been universally appreciated.\nWe are impressed by his vision and dynamism, which are\nnecessary for the United Nations to cope with the new\nrealities and challenges of our time. Mr. Boutros-Ghali was\na well-known figure in my country even before he became\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. We consider\nhim to be a sincere friend of Nepal.\nAlthough small in military and economic strength,\nNepal is fully alive to its responsibilities as a Member of\nthis world Organization. Nepal will not hesitate to take an\nindependent and objective stand in favour of larger good and\njustice. For us, the Charter of the United Nations captures\nthe highest ideals of mankind. I take this opportunity to\nrededicate the commitment of the people and the\nGovernment of Nepal to the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are sure\nthat your vast experience, personal qualifications, and\nintimate knowledge of the manifold problems confronting the\ninternational community will serve you well in the\nperformance of your duties. Please be assured of the fullest\ncooperation and support of the Liberian delegation.\nWe extend a deserving tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for the efficient and able\nmanner in which he handled the affairs of the Assembly\nduring the past year. His decisiveness and fairness paid off\ngreatly in producing the many results which are a positive\noutgrowth of the debate of the previous session.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, also\ndeserves special commendation for his persistent and tireless\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5\nefforts in trying to secure a world that is both peaceful and\njust and sustained by an equitable economic order. Indeed,\nhis devotion and singular commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the Organization have brought renewed\nconfidence on the prospects of achieving mankind\u2019s dream\nof a stable international environment.\nWe seize this opportunity to welcome the\nnewly-admitted Members of the United Nations. It is our\nfervent hope that they will make a meaningful contribution\nto our common search for global peace and security.\nOver the past three years Liberia\u2019s external relations, in\nresponse to domestic imperatives, have focused on the\nachievement of four primary objectives: first, to ensure that\ninternational opinion is sensitized to the serious effects of\nthe civil war in Liberia and the need for international\nsupport to end the conflict; secondly, to effect the\nmobilization of humanitarian and emergency relief assistance\nfor the war-ravaged population; thirdly, to help sustain the\nconsensus on the situation in Liberia within the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), and to\nsecure broader international acceptance of the ECOWAS\npeace plan as the best possible formula for resolving the\nLiberian civil strife; and, fourthly, to enhance the peace\nprocess itself by neutralizing attempts to resolve the Liberian\nconflict through the military victory of a faction, while\nencouraging a negotiated political settlement of this\nseemingly intractable conflict.\nIn pursuit of these objectives, the Interim Government\nof National Unity (IGNU) has participated in 25 peace talks\nand a great number of other consultations with the Liberian\nfactions, the leaders of subregional, regional and\ninternational organizations, and foreign Governments to\nenhance the prospects for peace in Liberia.\nIt is now my pleasing duty to inform the Assembly that\nthe Interim Government of National Unity, the National\nPatriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation\nMovement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) signed a\npeace accord in Cotonou, the Republic of Benin, on 25 July\n1993. The Cotonou Agreement is a significant breakthrough\nin the quest for durable peace in Liberia.\nBy agreeing on a process beginning with a cease-fire\nand leading to disarmament, demobilization and then free\nand fair elections, we Liberians have all finally decided on\nhow power will be acquired in our country. The Agreement\nis therefore a great victory for the people of Liberia in their\nefforts to secure a democratic future.\nAs my delegation stated on 10 August 1993 during the\nSecurity Council\u2019s consideration of the report (S/26200) of\nthe Secretary-General on Liberia, the Cotonou Agreement is\nalso a victory for the leaders and peoples of the member\nStates of the Economic Community of West African States,\nwho took a bold and courageous initiative to resolve a\nsecurity question in their subregion, with the active support\nand cooperation of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU).\nOn that occasion, we went on to state, and we here\nrepeat, that the United Nations must also share in this\nvictory. In this vein we wish to register our appreciation to\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his consuming\ninterest in the crisis in Liberia. We thank him immensely\nfor his thorough and incisive reports on Liberia, which\nenhanced the decisiveness of the Security Council with\nrespect to resolutions 788 (1992), 813 (1993) and\n866 (1993).\nWe also commend the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative for Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers; the\nOAU Eminent Person for Liberia, former Zimbabwean\nPresident the Rev. Dr. Canaan Banana; and the former\nExecutive Secretary of ECOWAS, Dr. Abbas Bundu; whose\nrelentless collaborative efforts helped to make the Cotonou\nAgreement a reality.\nThe people of Liberia will for ever remain grateful to\nthe gallant men and women of the ECOWAS Cease-fire\nMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). Enduring thanks go to the\nWest African States which have made troop contributions to\nthe peace-keeping effort: Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra\nLeone, Gambia, Mali and Senegal.\nDuring the process of negotiating the Cotonou\nAgreement, the Interim Government, largely a coalition of\nvarious political parties and interest groups representing the\nvast majority of our citizenry who do not bear arms,\ndemanded the disarmament of all combatants as a sine qua\nnon for the restoration of peace. The armed factions\nconceded to this demand on condition that a new,\ntransitional authority, to include the Interim Government, be\norganized within a framework acceptable to them. This\nconcession, hardly an unreasonably high price to pay for\ndisarmament and peace, was made. The Cotonou\nAgreement, then, divided into a military and a political\ncomponent, encompasses provisions attending a trade-off.\nThe political demands are far-reaching, in that they\nrequire more than a simple reconfiguration of the Interim\nGovernment within the context of power-sharing. The\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nLiberian National Transitional Government, being a new\ncreation, requires the divestiture of power from the current\ninterim authorities. On the other hand, the warring factions,\ndivested of their arms and demobilized, will equally cease to\nexist as fighting forces.\nTo strengthen the Agreement, or otherwise reinforce the\nconfidence of the parties, it was agreed that the installing of\nthe Transitional Government, and the beginning of the\ndisarmament process, each being a precondition for the\nother, would ensue simultaneously. However, this demand\nfor concurrent processes harbours the prospective danger that\nan achievement lag in either component, military or political,\nmay tend to undermine confidence in the entire peace\nprocess and thereby threaten the understanding.\nWhat, then, does each phase require, and how much\nand in what area has progress been made?\nThe implementation of the political phase of the\nAccords has largely been completed, and on schedule. The\nInterim Government has complied with all the concessions\nrequired for disarmament so that Liberians may live free\nfrom fear and have a chance of being at peace with each\nother.\nA five-member Council of State has been formed to\nconstitute the executive authority of the Transitional\nGovernment. The legislature, the judiciary, and the\nElections Commission are being reorganized or otherwise\nmade to reflect the inclusive intent of the transitional period.\nThe Liberian National Transitional Government is waiting to\nbe installed once the disarmament process begins. Pacta\nsunt servanda. What, then, is the requirement for the\ndisarmament process to begin? The following paragraph\nfrom the report of the Secretary-General on Liberia, of 4\nAugust 1993, correctly reflects the specific provisions of the\nagreement and the factor motivating them. The\nSecretary-General states:\n\\\"Given the level of mistrust existing between\nECOMOG and the NPFL, special measures were\ndevised to make ECOMOG acceptable to all parties in\noverseeing encampment, disarmament and\ndemobilization. It was agreed that ECOMOG would be\nexpanded to include new troops from countries not\nalready participating in ECOMOG. These troops would\nbe drawn from other ECOWAS countries, as well as\nfrom OAU countries outside of the West African\nsubregion. In addition, it was proposed that United\nNations military observers would monitor and verify\nthe cease-fire as well as the implementation of the\nencampment, disarmament and demobilization\nprovisions of the Agreement.\\\" (S/26200, para. 7)\nA month later, in September 1993, the\nSecretary-General, recognizing that these preparations for\ndisarmament would not keep pace with the political\narrangements, advanced a most constructive proposal in his\nreport of 9 September 1993 as follows:\n\\\"... The Agreement forecasts that the\ntransitional government would be established\napproximately one month after the signing of the\nagreement, concomitant with the commencement of\nthe disarmament process. While this process is\nalready somewhat behind schedule, the establishment\nof the transitional government is crucial to\nreinforcing national reconciliation. I therefore urge\nECOMOG to move quickly in commencing the\ndisarmament process, with monitoring provided by\nthe advance team of UNOMIL, even before full\ndeployment of the expanded ECOMOG and\nUNOMIL. In this regard, it is encouraging to note\nthat NPFL expressed to the planning mission its\nreadiness to accept troops from among the present\nECOMOG contingent to be deployed in NPFL areas.\nWith the expected full deployment of the advanced\nteam of United Nations military observers in the\ncoming days, the disarmament process could possibly\nbegin immediately thereafter.\\\" (S/26422, para. 40)\nLast week in Monrovia, Dr. Amos Sawyer, the\nPresident of the Interim Government of National Unity,\npublicly assured the Liberian people that if the armed\nfactions accept the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal and allow\nthe disarmament process to commence, he would\nimmediately transfer power to the transitional authorities.\nHowever, the unwillingness of any of the armed factions to\navail itself of the proposal need not necessarily be viewed as\nreflective of a lack of will or suggestive of bad faith.\nScrupulous adherence to the actual terms of the Agreement\nmay ultimately enhance the prospects for genuine peace,\nhowever slow and exacting the process may prove to be.\nMeanwhile, efforts continue to get the full complement of\nadditional ECOMOG forces and United Nations observers.\nThe Government of Liberia wishes to thank the United\nStates Government for its contribution to the Trust Fund of\nthe Economic Community of West African States to\nfacilitate the expansion of ECOMOG and assist the forces\ncurrently in place. We renew our request to other friendly\nGovernments to respond to the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal\nfor contributions to the Trust Fund as a means of advancing\nthe peace process in Liberia.\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7\nWe are convinced that the enabling conditions for\ndisarmament will be expeditiously created and that the\nTransitional Government will be installed shortly. The fact\nthat the cease-fire continues to hold and that the parties are\nlargely cooperating with each other is a basis for continuing\nconfidence in the commitment of the parties.\nOur hearts are touched by the great outpouring of\nempathy and good will from countries that have contributed\nto the well-being of the people of Liberia since the\nbeginning of our conflict. Through the specialized agencies\nof the United Nations system, as well as many private\nvolunteer and non-governmental organizations, they have\nenabled many Liberians to find life worth living because of\nthe genuine concern that has been demonstrated. Our thanks\ngo to all those who continue to make a difference in the\nlives of our people.\nThe Transitional Government, when installed with\nauthority spanning the entire country, will stand in need of\nextensive relief assistance to respond effectively to the\nmonumental human suffering existing in some parts of\nLiberia. Our delegation envisages an upsurge in the demand\nfor humanitarian assistance, with food and medical supplies\nbeing the obvious priorities. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to stand ready to assist the people of Liberia for\na reasonable period, as it will take time before the\nadvantages of peace are translated into real improvements in\nthe lives of the people.\nA successful disarmament exercise will be the\nlong-awaited signal for our people in refugee camps to\nreturn home. Indeed, the Transitional Government will need\nthe cooperation and assistance of men of good will\neverywhere in order to succeed in the awesome tasks of\nrepatriation, resettlement and rehabilitation. The gruesome\ncivil war devastated the economy of the country, paralysed\nvital social services and destroyed basic infrastructure. It is\nsignificant that the political division of the country has\nprevented a coordinated needs survey to fully assess the\nreconstruction demand.\nIt is important, also, that the Transitional Government\nhas the task of helping to prepare the country for free and\nfair elections, to be held under international supervision and\nmonitoring within six to seven months. This is hardly ideal\ntiming, but it proved to be the best that a negotiated\nsettlement could produce. Clearly, the international\ncommunity has a moral obligation to help the people of\nLiberia succeed in this endeavour, since the very thought of\nfailure attending these exercises is, in itself, a nightmare.\nThe Interim Government has striven, even in the\nthroes of a civil war, to maintain law and order and operate\nwith a Constitution which affirms civil liberties and respect\nfor fundamental human rights. We, as men of conscience,\ncondemn and stand in total opposition against those who, in\nthe midst of the war, trained their weapons on helpless\ncivilians. We therefore thank the Secretary-General for\nresponding with dispatch to the Interim Government\u2019s\nrequest for the establishment of a commission of inquiry to\ninvestigate the atrocities committed since the commencement\nof the civil war. We believe that the Wako Commission\nReport has contributed to amassing the evidence required in\norder for justice to be done to the perpetrators of the Harbel\narea massacre and other massacres.\nLiberia\u2019s tragic circumstances, coupled with the\nefforts to resolve the conflict, provide useful lessons that\ncould be most instructive for the international community.\nThe Liberian peace process has shown that, even in the face\nof scarce resources, member States of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States have contained a security\nthreat in their subregion by marshalling the requisite political\nwill to do so. The dispatch and maintenance of a peace-\nkeeping force in Liberia by the leaders of ECOWAS\nrepresent the finest hour for Africa in its efforts to maintain\npeace and security on the continent.\nThe Liberian experience has also demonstrated that\npeace initiatives that are conceived and implemented within\na subregional context, while supported and assisted by\nregional and international organizations, are a practical\napproach which stands the best chance of success in conflict\nresolution. The States closest to the conflict are likely to\nhave a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, the\ninterplay of forces within the milieu. It is against this\nbackground that the Government of Liberia gave its fullest\nsupport for, and endorsement of, the establishment of a\nmechanism for conflict prevention, management and\nresolution within the Organization of African Unity.\nWe welcome the establishment of the Department of\nPeace-keeping Operations in the Secretariat for the planning\nand coordination of all United Nations peace-keeping\nactivities, confident that it will countenance greater regional\ninvolvement in conflict management, buttressed by support\nfrom the United Nations.\nOn the question of Somalia, the Government of\nLiberia welcomes the bold and courageous efforts by the\nUnited Nations to resolve the tragic situation there and bring\npeace to that country. We deplore the killing of United\nNations peace-keepers in Mogadishu, and we support the\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nefforts by this world body to bring to justice those\nresponsible for such acts. The implementation of the Addis\nAbaba Accords, signed on 27 March 1993, at the national\nreconciliation conference, offers the best hope for a peaceful\ntransition to a pacified and democratic State of Somalia. We\ntherefore urge the Somali factions to respect and implement\nthat agreement.\nRegarding South Africa, we welcome the current\nmulti-party negotiations in that country as the most inclusive\nforum so far convened to end the apartheid system and\ncreate a non-racial, democratic society. We are pleased that,\nas a result of these negotiations, a democratic Government\nis scheduled to be elected in April 1994.\nWith regard to Angola, the Government of Liberia\nwishes to call on UNITA to abandon its military agenda and\nseek to resolve the crisis through peaceful means in\nconformity with the Bicesse Accords. In this light, we also\nmake a special appeal to UNITA to conform to the wishes\nof the people of Angola by accepting the results of the\nSeptember 1992 elections. We call on it to sign the protocol\nof agreement negotiated in Abidjan in a spirit of national\nunity and reconciliation of all Angolans.\nLast month the world welcomed the historic and\ndramatic developments affecting peace in the Middle East,\nwhen the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) recognized each other. The signing of\nan agreement on Palestinian autonomy means that the first\nreal step has indeed been taken towards Palestinian self-rule.\nIt is our sincerest hope that this agreement will soon be\ncomplemented by peace accords between Israel and all of its\nArab neighbours.\nPerhaps no problem, apart from the spectre of a\nnuclear holocaust, has elicited more global concern than that\nof the environment, given its intrinsic linkage to man\u2019s\nsurvival and his economic well-being. In a world\ncharacterized by issues of common concern and\never-increasing interdependence of States, a collective\napproach is indispensable in meeting the challenges posed by\nenvironmental problems and the international economic\nsituation. The environmental crisis is now posing a serious\nthreat to the life-support system of our planet. This is why\nmy delegation believes it is most important that Member\nStates maintain the momentum gained at the historic 1992\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\nde Janeiro, by effective follow-up at the national and\ninternational levels. We welcome the establishment of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development whose\nresponsibility it is to review and monitor implementation of\nAgenda 21.\nWith respect to the world economic situation, it\nremains our firm belief that, in order to achieve progress in\nglobal economic recovery, issues of long-term significance,\nsuch as the excruciating debt burden of developing countries,\nlow commodity prices, protectionism and dwindling resource\nflow into developing countries, should all form the real\nagenda for the setting of priorities to include a permanent\nincrease in global economic growth. The current gloomy\nsituation of the international economy, worse now than in\nthe previous decade, is further accentuated by new risks to\nthe world economy caused by conflicts, the problem of\nrefugees and the plight of the world\u2019s children. These\nproblems pose a real threat to growth and development in\nmany regions of the world.\nIn view of what I have said, there is an urgent need,\nas a part of the continuing effort to forge a new and fairer\ninternational economic order, for the peace dividends derived\nfrom the easing of bipolar tension to be deployed to meet\nthe development needs of the world\u2019s most economically\ndisadvantaged regions. They should not be reserved for the\nexclusive use of the already wealthy nations, and they should\nnot be directed only towards the political and economic\nliberalization of a particular region of the world. All must\ntake into account the fact that economic opportunity and\nsocial justice are essential preconditions for peace and\nsecurity in our global village.\nThe post-cold-war era has offered the United Nations\nnew opportunities and challenges, particularly in the\nfulfilment of its unique responsibility as the conscience of\nmankind. In recent years, the United Nations has taken bold\ndecisions in peacemaking, peace-keeping and peace-building,\nhumanitarian intervention and the protection of human rights.\nThese assertive approaches have made the United Nations\nappear more relevant to the peoples of the world.\nIt is hoped that, in its honourable pursuits, the United\nNations will continue to be led by men of vision who can\nensure the realization of the noble ideals enshrined in its Charter -\nfostering world peace and promoting development and\ncooperation amongst all the peoples of our one world.\n"

        "file_text": "\nIn extending to you, Sir, the warmest congratulations of the\ndelegation of Cameroon on your election to the presidency\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, I am\nnot merely obeying protocol. I do so as well out of my wish\nto pay a tribute to your outstanding qualities and to welcome\nthe significant contribution your country, Guyana, has made\nto the building of a more just and more united world.\nYour predecessor, our colleague Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria,\ncarried out his mandate very well. We are grateful to him\nand express all our appreciation to him.\nFor two years now our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, has devoted unusual energy to the\nmanagement of the Organization, management that has been\nmade difficult by the increase in the number of United\nNations missions, the complexity of the challenges to be\nmet, and the acute financial crisis that is hindering the\nsuccessful carrying out of his activities. Cameroon wishes\nto commend him for his wisdom and to assure him of its\nsupport.\nThe Organization\u2019s universality has been enhanced by\nthe admission of six new Member States. It is a pleasure for\nme to welcome them among us and to assure them of\nCameroon\u2019s readiness to maintain and develop relations of\ncooperation and friendship with them.\nThe especially significant and unexpected changes that\nhave marked the end of this century confirm our feeling that\nwe must never despair of the human being and that,\nwhatever the circumstances may be, we must keep faith in\nmankind\u2019s future.\nIndeed, the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly is being held at a time when the image of that\nhistoric handshake between Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin and\nPresident Yasser Arafat is still bright in our minds, a\nhandshake that sealed the mutual recognition between Israel\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization and consecrated\nthe agreement on autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. Never\nbefore have conditions been as conducive to the building of\na lasting peace in the Middle East.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 7\nThat historic event, a sign of the times, was followed\nby the adoption by the Parliament of South Africa, which is\nstill composed exclusively of whites and coloureds, of the\nagreement to establish a Transitional Executive Council,\nconferring upon the black majority a right to participate in\nthe management of that country\u2019s affairs with an eye to the\nApril 1994 elections, which should usher in a united,\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa.\nThose are undeniably two major events of exceptional\nsignificance, events that demonstrate the extent of the\nupheaval in the world we are now witnessing.\nAllow me, therefore, to salute the courage and great\nvision demonstrated by the Israeli Government and the\nleaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Certainly,\nthe peace in the Middle East that had seemed elusive is now\nwithin reach. Cameroon had always hoped for this, and we\nare therefore gratified at the progress made and wish to pay\na tribute to the various protagonists who contributed to it.\nAnd with regard to this situation, has the time not come\nto update the Organization\u2019s documents dealing with the\nsituation in the Middle East? Cameroon intends to\ncontribute to the consideration of this question the\ncircumstances call for. The tone and provisions of\nresolutions concerning South Africa also need to be brought\ninto line with the changes taking place in that country.\nCameroon supported the appeal made from this rostrum\nby President Nelson Mandela for the lifting of the economic\nsanctions against South Africa. We salute that outstanding\nson of Africa, and we include in this commendation\nPresident De Klerk, whose open-minded attitude has earned\nour admiration.\nThe democratic transition in South Africa is at once\nfragile and promising for the whole of the African continent.\nIt demands the support of the international community,\nwhich must work to put an end to violence and the\ndestabilizing actions of the forces in the country that are\nopposed to change.\nUnfortunately, this remarkable improvement in the\nsituations in the Middle East and South Africa cannot mask\nthe threats to international peace and security caused by the\npersistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world\narising out of ethnic claims, the resurgence of nationalistic\nfeelings, religious intolerance, the desire for power, poverty\nand underdevelopment.\nAt the very heart of Europe, a frightful war continues\nin the Balkans, a war the more frightful because the ideology\nunderlying it is an affront to the conscience of mankind.\nThe indignation it has aroused throughout the world demands\nthat the weapons be silenced to enable the virtues of\ndialogue to prevail over the logic of exclusion and conquest.\nThat war is also sorely testing the international community\u2019s\nability to defend the principles and values of civilization in\nour era.\nIt is equally untenable that in Angola innocent people,\ncaught up in an increasingly senseless war, continue to be\nmassacred. It must be obvious to everyone that a solution\nto the Angolan problem cannot be imposed by force of arms.\nIt resides in concertation, dialogue and negotiation. We\ntherefore urge the parties concerned to seize this most recent\nopportunity to achieve peace afforded them by strict\nimplementation of the Abidjan Agreements and the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council.\nThe imperatives of peace are also pressing upon our\nLiberian, Somali and Mozambican brothers and sisters, who\nhave legitimate aspirations to the stability needed to\nreconstruct their countries.\nAs regards Haiti, it is also important, if legality is to\ntriumph, that everything possible be done for the\nimplementation of the Governors Island Agreement.\nIn Western Sahara, we have not lost hope that,\nfollowing the negotiations now under way, the obstacles to\na referendum on the future status of the territory will be\nremoved.\nIn other parts of the world where hotbeds of tension\npersist the spirit of confrontation must yield to the search for\nnegotiated solutions. In this context, Cameroon welcomes\nthe decisive contribution of the United Nations to the\nrestoration of peace in Cambodia. In paying tribute to the\nmemory of all those who have paid for peace in Cambodia\nwith their lives, I include Captain Ndi Ncho Abrahams of\nthe Cameroonian contingent of military observers of the\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\n(UNTAC), who fell on the field of honour in Phnom Penh\non 7 September 1993.\nI also wish to extend here our warm congratulations to\nHis Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk on his restoration to\nthe throne of Cambodia. We are convinced that his lofty\nstature, eminent qualities and long experience will help his\ncountry to set out again on the path to progress and the\nreconciliation of its children.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMeeting the challenge of peace, involves not only the\nsilencing of weapons, but also ensuring the reconstruction of\ncountries ravaged by war. We therefore appeal that, as\nmeasures are taken to settle certain regional conflicts, the\nnecessary resources be mobilized to meet, as well as\nhumanitarian needs, the reconstruction needs of African\ncountries that have been torn by armed conflicts.\nThis would bolster the willingness of the African Heads\nof State to assume greater responsibility in the prevention,\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts in their region. The\nmechanism created for that purpose at the twenty-ninth\nSummit of the Organization of African Unity deserves the\nsupport of the international community, as it is involved in\nthe implementation of the agenda for peace adopted by the\nSecurity Council. Furthermore, the adoption in Libreville in\nSeptember 1993 of a non-aggression pact between the 11\nStates members of the Economic Community of Central\nAfrican States is part of this trend. Concluded in the\nframework of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security\nQuestions in Central Africa, created last year by the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, this agreement is\nan essential link in the chain of confidence-building\nmeasures aimed at the progressive reduction of the armed\nforces and military budgets of the States of the subregion.\nOur States are thereby determined to create an area of peace,\nsecurity and solidarity. We are thus entitled to expect the\ncontinued support of the international community for this\ninitiative, sponsored by the United Nations.\nIn a more general context, the progress achieved in the\nfield of disarmament and arms limitation should continue.\nWe call on the major Powers to redouble their efforts to\naccelerate the disarmament process, especially in the field of\nnuclear weapons. The conclusion of a treaty banning\nnuclear tests would meet the expectations of the international\ncommunity, just as the indefinite extension of the Non-\nProliferation Treaty would help reassure the non-nuclear-\nweapon States. In this respect, we praise the dialogue being\npursued by the parties concerned to find a negotiated\nsolution to the differences between North Korea, on the one\nhand and the International Atomic Energy Agency and the\nGovernment of the United States of America on the other.\nLastly, the progressive establishment of the structures\nof the Organization\u2019s executive secretariat for the control of\nchemical weapons strengthens our conviction that general\nand complete disarmament is not just a dream. It is a\nfervent aspiration of mankind that could be achieved if\ngreater political will were focused on that goal.\nAt the recent World Conference on Human Rights, held\nin Vienna, our common vision of the values underlying\nmankind\u2019s shared aspiration to the effective enjoyment of\nhuman rights made the longstanding dispute about a possible\nhierarchy as between civil and political rights and economic,\nsocial and cultural rights outdated. Now enshrined as\nindivisible and interdependent, all these rights have one\nobjective alone: the promotion and protection of human\ndignity, regardless of considerations of race, colour, sex or\nreligion. Recognition of that objective has contributed to the\nrebirth of the idea of the universality of human rights and\nhas given those rights the moral and legal force of a\ncategorical imperative with unassailable legitimacy.\nThis development encourages the Government of\nCameroon, with the impetus given by His Excellency\nPresident Paul Biya, to continue updating the legal and\ninstitutional frameworks to promote the effective enjoyment\nof human rights by our citizens. Our resolute march towards\ndemocracy can be gauged by the incomparable freedom of\nexpression burgeoning throughout our national media, the\nflourishing of political parties, the vitality of popular\nparticipation in public life and the establishment, in the wake\nof the State\u2019s gradual disengagement, of new and vast areas\nfor the development of private initiative.\nThe National Committee on Human Rights and\nFreedoms, whose activities enhance its credibility, is helping\nenormously to make public opinion aware of the importance\nof human rights and to alert our authorities to any possible\nviolation. The recent organization in Yaound\u00e9 by the United\nNations Centre for Human Rights of a training seminar for\nmembers of that Committee highlights the role of\ninternational cooperation in the promotion of human rights,\nparticularly in developing countries.\nThis cooperation suggests a new approach, necessitating\na reversal of the tendency to turn human rights into political\ntools. This tendency often leads to a selective awareness of\nhuman rights violations and discrimination in the application\nof sanctions. Cooperation also suggests a new type of\npartnership, allowing the highly publicized activism on\nhuman rights to be replaced by calm and constructive\ndialogue between the various parties in charge of promoting\nand protecting human rights - States, national institutions,\nnon-governmental organizations and multilateral institutions.\nIn this context, the proposal to establish a post of high\ncommissioner for human rights has its merits. None the\nless, it gives rise to some questions, the importance of which\nrequires that it be considered attentively and in depth.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 9\nThe universality of human rights, which everyone must\nhenceforth respect, requires the democratization of\ninternational economic relations. It would be unrealistic to\ncircumscribe the exercise of democracy within national\nboundaries, when there are also flagrant injustices in\ninternational economic relations that constitute grave\nviolations of human dignity.\nA victim of such injustices, Africa, more than any other\ndeveloping region, has the characteristics of a continent\nadrift. It is toiling under an intolerable debt burden in a\nsituation exacerbated by an overall trend towards\ndisinvestment, a decline in official development assistance\nand a steady deterioration in the terms of trade as a result of\nthe continuing fall in commodity prices.\nIn these circumstances, is it acceptable that net financial\nflows should continue from the impoverished African\ncountries to the rich countries? As we have already pointed\nout, this situation cannot be considered in economic terms\nalone. It is an ethical problem involving the conscience of\nour Northern partners and of international financial\ninstitutions.\nNeed we recall that despite the seriousness of the\neconomic crisis they are facing the African States, like the\ncountries of the East, have undertaken courageous reforms\ntowards liberalizing their economies and democratizing their\npolitical systems?\nWhile we are pleased at the mobilization of resources\naimed at accompanying reform in the countries of the East,\nwe must deplore the fact that no similar effort has been\nmade for the benefit of the African countries that are also in\na state of transition. Structural adjustment plans are the only\nalternative solution proposed to them. Because they are\nbecoming increasingly exorbitant and difficult to bear, their\nsocial costs need to be given more attention by our partners\nso that the already fragile foundations of our young States\nwill not crumble.\nThe very recent International Conference, on African\nDevelopment, held in Tokyo, will give us an opportunity to\ndraw the attention of the international community to the\ndistress of the African continent.\nThe failure of the United Nations Programme of Action\nfor African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-\n1990 and the disappointing progress of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nunderscore, if need be, the urgent need to establish for that\ncontinent a consistent set of measures to stimulate recovery\nincluding, in particular, debt alleviation and the enhancement\nof human resources, the transfer of technology, support for\nthe diversification of production and the improvement of\nconditions for access of our products to international\nmarkets.\nWe must set our sights on establishing a fund for\nfinancing African development. The imperatives of\ninternational solidarity are not consistent with\ncompartmentalization on the basis of racial or geographical\nconsiderations. Hence, we cannot leave the African\ncountries at the mercy of market forces, which are devoid of\nall legitimacy owing to speculation. The international\ncommunity must therefore undertake to construct a more\nlegitimate new world order that is in keeping with full\nrespect for law and justice.\nThe world partnership for sustainable development\nenshrined in Rio de Janeiro responds to this aspiration.\nWhile we are pleased at the establishment of the\nCommission for Sustainable Development, the release of\nresources required for the financing of Agenda 21 has not\nyet been accomplished.\nIn the social sphere, activities conducted throughout the\nUnited Nations system with a view to fighting against the\nAIDS pandemic and to repressing the illicit traffic in\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances deserve high\npriority in the agenda of our Organization.\nSimilar importance should be attached to the integration\nof women in the process of development and to the\nprotection of vulnerable groups of society.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment planned for Cairo in 1994, the World Summit\nfor Social Development, to be held in 1995 in Copenhagen,\nand the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held\nalso in 1995, in Beijing, will offer opportunities to review all\nof these issues at the highest level. These gatherings will\nmake it possible for us to refine our understanding of these\nproblems in order better to integrate them in our\ndevelopment policies.\nGuaranteeing international peace and security and\npromoting the economic and social development of its\nMembers are the tasks that the United Nations has been\ncalled upon to perform since its establishment. The changes\ngenerated by the end of East-West rivalry have created\nconditions more conducive to the attainment of these\nobjectives. Our Organization should therefore rethink its\nstructures and its working methods in order to increase their\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\neffectiveness, the better to respond to the ever-growing\nexpectations of the international community.\nThe restructuring process under way is of course part\nof this trend. We are pleased at the prevailing spirit of\nconsensus in the search for solutions to this problem - a\nproblem made complex and delicate because of the need to\nreconcile the need for effectiveness and the imperative of\ndemocratization which alone can safeguard the plurality of\napproaches that underlies the universality of our\nOrganization.\n\nIn this context, the reform of the Security Council\nshould not be confined to a mere broadening of its\ncomposition. It should above all make it possible to revive\nthe spirit behind the decision to confer upon the members of\nthe Council broad powers regarding the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. These powers should\ntherefore be exercised in the interest of all, and not on the\nbasis of other considerations.\nThe General Assembly should, along the same lines,\nremain a global forum where the positions of States are\nexpressed and harmonized. We are therefore in favour of a\nstrong Secretariat endowed with adequate structures and with\na highly qualified staff that reflects the diversity and the\nexcellence of the peoples of the United Nations. This means\nthat throughout the system and within our Organization, the\nongoing process of restructuring should be consistent with\nthe spirit of the Charter.\nMankind has always cherished the utopian dream of a\nworld in which man would no longer be a danger to his\nfellow man, and in which peace, justice and equity would\nprevail. The sudden acceleration of history at the turn of\nthis century gives this utopian hope an impetus that enhances\nour shared perception of the need to establish a new and\nmore united world order. This \\\"promise of history\\\" being\nshaped will be an expression of the convergence of our will\nto free mankind of the consequences of a past that we hope\nis forever behind us. The universal conscience cannot put\nup with the horrors of war and of flagrant violations of\nhuman rights, nor should it at the dawning of the third\nmillennium tolerate the persistence of poverty and hardship\nthat trample underfoot the intrinsic values of our shared\nhumanity.\nThus the United Nations must meet the challenge of\nrenewal in order fully to play its central role in the building\nof a world consistent with the ideals of its founding fathers.\nIn the final analysis, history condemns us to be hopeful - in\nthe midst of violence, does man not persevere in his utopian\ndream of peace?\n"

He represents Guyana, an active member\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, of which Sudan is proud to\nbe a founding member. May I also extend our thanks and\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the\nskilful and efficient manner in which he conducted the work\nof the previous session.\nThe United Nations represents hope for all nations and\nnascent States, especially those that attained their\nindependence through long struggle. It is a great honour and\npleasure for me to welcome our sister country, Eritrea,\nwhich has joined the membership of the United Nations.\nOur two peoples continue to enjoy mutual respect and\nesteem, and our Governments are endeavouring to foster\nfraternal relations with a view to achieving prosperity for the\nbrotherly peoples of the two countries, and for the whole\nregion.\nAllow me also to salute the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and\nAndorra, which joined the United Nations as part of a new\nmomentum contributing to human endeavours to achieve\nstability, prosperity and peace for the world.\nI also salute the Secretary-General ,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is leading the Secretariat of\nthe United Nations at a crucial stage as it faces many\nchallenges and pressures.\nThe Sudan learned with grief and sadness of the tragic\nloss of life in the earthquake which struck parts of India. I\nextend the deepest sympathy of the Sudan to friendly India\nalong with heartfelt condolences to the families of those who\nlost their lives.\nSince the previous session, important events have\nemerged in the international arena. We are now witnessing\naccelerated political and social change unprecedented in\nhistory. New international situations and changes occur\nevery day; we are all trying to keep up with them. Today,\nwe are experiencing a phase of travail and transition, which\nresults every day in new, divergent patterns. The most\nstriking of those patterns is the widening of the gap between\nthe rich North and the less privileged South.\nThe trend in today\u2019s world is towards the machinery of\nregional groupings. This reflects the fact that the world has\nalready started to be more inclined to think in a more\ncollective manner. We hope that this new pattern will be\npositive and constructive, giving due respect to the charters\nand covenants that are binding on all. We seriously assert\nthat developing countries are no longer principal partners in\nmost of the resolutions that are adopted, particularly within\nthe framework of the Security Council and other United\nNations organs. Had developing countries been allowed\nequitable participation, their contribution could have been\nmore effective in the course of many of these important\nevents, specially in the field of regional and international\npeace and security.\nFour years ago we started reviewing the functions of\nthe United Nations and its various organs. We must place\non record, from this rostrum, our conviction that this\nOrganization has a basic role to play in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the achievement of\nprosperity for mankind. For the United Nations fully to\nperform such a vital role, its governing Charter must be fully\nrespected. The Charter must also be adhered to by all, and\nmust be updated to keep pace with the developments that\nhave occurred since its adoption.\nThe General Assembly too should be enabled fully to\nperform its functions for the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity. The General Assembly should be given its due\nimportance, equal and parallel to that of the Security\nCouncil.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 35\nSelectivity in implementing the provisions of the\nCharter must be abandoned. In this regard, we firmly stress\nthat the activities of the Security Council must be transparent\nand that the Council should adopt a democratic approach in\nits decisions. It is thus inevitable that the question of the\nCouncil\u2019s permanent membership, and the right of veto,\nwhich enables a few States to invalidate the opinion of the\nmajority, be reviewed, especially at a time when the United\nNations is advocating the values of democracy, participation,\njustice and equality.\nThe United Nations and one of its organs, the Security\nCouncil, are currently engaged in serious and active attempts\nto settle disputes based on new prospects for the\nestablishment of regional and international peace and\nsecurity. Let us pause here for a moment. We all aspire to\nsave the world from the calamities of war and the\ndestructive consequences of the prevailing social and\neconomic situation. Yet, at the same time, we reject double\nstandards in the resolutions of the Security Council,\nespecially in relation to international peace and security. We\nare anxious lest the United Nations lose its proper vision in\nthe heat of events.\nThe nature of the responsibilities and duties of the\nOrganization requires strict neutrality. International peace\nand security is a principle that must apply to all. But to see\nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffer to the brink of\nelimination because of the shaky and defective resolutions of\nthe Security Council is a situation that should not be allowed\nto pass unnoticed. Similarly, the Somali people cannot be\nallowed to remain victims of irregularities committed by the\ninternational forces there because of the departure from their\nbinding original mandate. This is a matter that requires both\nchange and a strict and immediate investigation. We are still\nwitnessing the deterioration of the security situation in\nSomalia owing to the continuing fighting between the\ninternational forces and some of the Somali factions, as well\nas with individuals. This has resulted in many killings and\nhas caused the international forces to stray from their\noriginal mandate. We have previously expressed our\nreservations with regard to the hasty use of international\nforces in Somalia without consulting the States of the region\nor exhausting the efforts and endeavours being exerted by\nthose States to find a solution to the Somali crisis.\nWe are concerned that the continuation of fighting\nbetween the international forces and some of the Somali\nfactions will shed more blood, complicate the problem and\nrender it insoluble by the United Nations. Therefore, we\nrequest the United Nations and the forces that are supposed\nto operate under its banner to refrain from continuing the\ntype of actions that would provoke the Somali people and\nthe country\u2019s factions or affect the structure of their political\nfuture, values and cultural and religious heritage.\nWe also deem it fitting that the Permanent Committee\non Somalia of the States of The Horn of Africa be given the\nnecessary time to perform its pioneering function of finding\na solution to the Somali crisis. These States are better\nacquainted with the nature and dimension of the problem by\nvirtue of their special relations with Somalia and its people.\nWe will support new international arrangements that\nwill ensure the enhancement of the performance of the\nOrganization and establish justice and tranquillity among all.\nThe arrangements we are hoping for shall not infringe upon\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States or meddle\nwith their independence or right of decision-making.\nPreventive diplomacy, associated with peacemaking and\npeace-keeping, should be motivated by a basic goal, namely,\nthe elimination of regional and international tension. This\ncould be achieved by defining the causes of political and\nsocial conflicts in order to eliminate them so that different\nsocieties might enjoy stability, well-being, and peace.\nPreventive diplomacy and the subsequent use of political and\nmilitary force cannot be applied solely against less privileged\ncountries and vulnerable peoples.\nIn brief, we are hoping for a new formula within the\nframework of current international arrangements to guarantee\nthe rights of all and to save the world from the hegemony of\nthe stronger over the less privileged. We also aspire to a\ngreater role for the regional organizations of the developing\ncountries and to their representation in the important forum\nof the Security Council, which is entrusted with the task of\nmaintaining peace and security all over the world.\nAlong with this understanding of the new role of the\nUnited Nations in protecting and preserving the rights of\nStates, we call for the lifting of the economic embargo\nimposed on Iraq. The Iraqi people have suffered for an\nextended period of time from the unfair embargo that is still\nimposed on them, despite the exhaustion of the reasons that\ninvoked it.\nAnother example of the misuse of this international\nOrganization is the embargo imposed on Libya without any\nlegal and justified cause to permit the actions taken against\nthat country. Libya has already responded to Security\nCouncil resolution 731 (1992) and shown sufficient\nflexibility to settle its differences with the Western States, a\nmatter that would justify the lifting of the embargo imposed\non it.\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe agenda items before this session include important\nissues reflecting the accelerated pace of events I mentioned\nat the beginning of my statement. However, I prefer to be\ndirect in touching upon issues of immediate concern to us in\nthe Sudan because of the misunderstanding that has\naccompanied them.\nDuring the forty-eighth session of the Human Rights\nCommission, held at Geneva in March 1992, and upon a\nmotion by the United States representative, the Commission\nadopted a resolution appointing an independent expert\nassigned to investigate the human-rights situation in the\nSudan and to submit a report to the forty-ninth session of the\nCommission in March-April 1993. The States sponsoring\nthat resolution did not wish to wait for the report of the\nindependent expert but pushed the matter to the forty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, where a resolution on the\nalleged human-rights violations in the Sudan was adopted.\nThe sponsoring States used all the influence, pressure and\nthe mechanical majority they possessed to see that that\npolitically motivated resolution was adopted.\nIn his report to the forty-ninth session of the\nCommission on Human Rights in March 1993, the\nindependent expert praised the cooperation of the\nGovernment of the Sudan and explained that he had had\nneither the time nor the opportunity to judge the situation of\nhuman rights in the Sudan or to study the matter\ncomprehensively. He indicated that the Commission might\nwish to extend his mission in order to allow him to complete\nhis mandate. While we do not conceive of any justifiable\nreasons behind his appointment, the Government of the\nSudan nevertheless extended every possible cooperation to\nthe Special Rapporteur, who visited the Sudan last week and\nwill submit his report.\nRespect for and maintenance of human rights represent\none of the sacred principles that are enshrined in all divine\nreligions as well as in man-made laws. The Sudan, inspired\nby its cultural and civilized heritage, pays due attention to\nthe issues of human rights. The Sudanese Government and\nsociety respect and observe the human-rights values based\non their religious belief and traditions. Accordingly, we\nreject any politicization or manipulation of such a sacred\ndoctrine as a pretext for meddling in the internal affairs of\nStates or for imposing a specific cultural trend or option of\ncivilization on any State. For the same reason, we are of the\nview that developmental assistance should not be tied to a\ndistorted human-rights record. The right to development\nitself represents an inalienable human right. We also opt for\nequality and fairness in assessing or monitoring the\nperformance of States in the field of human rights. We\nadamantly reject policies that reflect a double standard in\ndealing with human rights, because the Sudan has been\nvictimized by such policies. We also hope that universality\nof human rights will not be construed to justify denial of the\ncultural, religious and indigenous specifics of various States\nand peoples.\nThose who pose as defenders of human rights in the\nSudan ignore the terrorist practices of the outlaws in\nsouthern Sudan lead by John Garang. They have opted to\nkeep silent with respect to the atrocities he has committed,\natrocities such as the abduction and recruitment of children\nfor military operations, the regular killing of civilian\npopulations, the downing of civilian aircraft and the\nkidnapping and killing of United Nations staff working in\nrelief operations. They have also kept silent with regard to\nhis continued obstruction of all serious peacemaking\nendeavours initiated inside or outside the Sudan. Not only\nthat, they have received him as a top official dignitary and\nextended to him every moral support, despite his gross\nviolation of human rights.\nIn this connection we view General Assembly\nresolution 47/142 as a biased resolution that has contributed\nto the intransigence of the Garang movement and motivated\nit to reject all Government endeavours to achieve a peaceful\nsettlement through negotiations. We are also convinced that\nthat resolution lacks any substantive justification, and we\nstand ready to provide all the factual information on the\nhuman-rights situation in the Sudan to all who are interested.\nThose who accuse the Government of the Sudan of\nviolating the human rights of its own citizens have also\nignored the giant achievements of the Government, such as\nadopting the conferences system along the lines of Shura\nand organizing the national conferences to determine the\nstructure of the political system in order to lay down the\nbasic foundations of national unity and to look for ways and\nmeans to achieve a real peace guaranteeing fundamental\npolitical, social, cultural and religious rights for all citizens.\nAs a result, a National Transitional Assembly was\nestablished as the supreme legislative organ of the country,\npending completion of the political structures at both the\nfederal and the state level and the conduct of the presidential\nelections to be held in the country at a subsequent stage.\nMany must have learned of the recent decision of the\nUnited States Government to add the Sudan to its own\nclassification of countries allegedly sponsoring terrorism.\nWhile the United States Government is free to take whatever\ndecision it deems appropriate, we have the right to question\nthe facts and findings on which the United States\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 37\nGovernment has based its decision. While the United States\nhas the right to enact domestic decisions, the utilization of\nsuch decisions as a prelude to further actions beyond its\nterritories contradicts international law and the United\nNations Charter. We cannot understand how a super-Power\nwhich enjoys permanent membership in the Security Council\ncan enact domestic legislation to justify the pursuit of its\nprivate interests in the territories of other countries. Such\ninstances are numerous, the most recent of which was the\nsearch in the port of Djibouti of a vessel freighting sugar en\nroute to sisterly Somalia.\nIt is our conviction that the motive behind the media\ncampaign against the Sudan is the alienation of Sudan from\nits African and Arab affiliations and the smearing of its\nimage by erroneously labelling its civilization as terrorist.\nThis media campaign constitutes a prelude to a siege on\nSudan similar to what has happened to some other countries.\nWe are known to all as a peaceful nation; we denounce\nterrorism in all its forms. Accordingly, the decision lacks the\nnecessary legal support, contravenes justice and good\nconscience and clearly exceeds the role of the United\nNations. As proof of our assertion, it could not generate any\nsupport. Former President Jimmy Carter and a number of\ncredible institutions and newspapers have expressed their\nscepticism and criticism regarding its ethical value.\nLikewise, the Sudanese peoples have demonstrated their\nrejection and denunciation of that decision. Real terrorism\nis when a single super-Power uses it as a pretext and utilizes\nits might to terrorize small developing countries for no\nreason except that they opted for a path of independent\ndecision-making and rejected blind proselytism, or merely\nfor their different views.\nMixing politics with humanitarian assistance is rather\nrisky, especially in relief work, which is a sensitive matter,\nas it directly affects human survival through supplying basic\nneeds such as food and medicine. This necessitates the\nabsolute neutrality of the relief donors. Recent years have\nwitnessed an increasing involvement of politics in\nhumanitarian work, which fact led Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga,\nPresident of the International Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC) to explicitly warn against the danger of mixing\npolitics with humanitarian work. Sudan has suffered\ntremendously from these attempts to tarnish its image by\nintentionally distorting its achievements in relief delivery so\nthat they are seen as failures, its initiatives depicted as\nobstructions and its cooperation as impediment of the inflow\nof relief supplies. The reality is that we feel we are unjustly\ntreated by some States and some media that tend to\nundermine our efforts in relief operation and blemish our\nreputation.\nHowever, Sudan has a bright and outstanding record in\nthis area. Operation Lifeline Sudan is an unprecedented\ninitiative; it has enabled the United Nations and\nnon-governmental organizations to provide relief supplies to\naffected populations, whoever and wherever they are. Since\nthe forty-seventh session, continuous efforts have been made\nto strengthen the efficiency of Operation Lifeline and its\nrelief programme, such as the signing of an agreement\nbetween the Government of the Sudan, the United Nations\nand the rebel factions in December 1992 to secure the flow\nof relief to all areas in need. In January 1993, another\nagreement was signed between the Government of the\nSudan, the United Nations and the non-governmental\norganizations to facilitate and enhance the role of the non-\ngovernmental organizations in relief and rehabilitation. In\nMarch 1993, the Government of the Sudan signed a\nmemorandum of understanding with the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross to streamline the cooperation\nbetween the Government and the Committee and to\nstrengthen the effectiveness of its operations in southern\nSudan. The allocation of 153,000 metric tons of grain by\nthe Government to the World Food Programme to be\ndistributed to the population in need represents a cornerstone\nof our contribution to relief efforts.\nThe mission of Mr. Vieri Traxler, Special Envoy of the\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan,\nand its positive outcome, stand as another example of the\ncooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the\ninternational community. A number of modalities were\nagreed upon during that mission to guarantee the full\nimplementation of all previously signed agreements. It is\nmy pleasure to convey to this Assembly that during Mr.\nTraxler\u2019s mission to the Sudan a number of steps were taken\nto implement what was agreed upon. On the initiative of the\nGovernment of the Sudan, an agreement was reached to send\njoint assessment missions, constituted by the United Nations\nand the non-governmental organizations working in relief\noperations, to about 30 safe locations in the three Southern\nStates, the Nuba mountains and Kordofan. It was also\nagreed that the town of Malakal and its environs would be\nconsidered a model of relief integrated programmes to be\nimplemented in other areas after proving successful. This is\nin addition to other steps oriented towards strengthening the\nefficiency of operations and ensuring relief for those in\nneed wherever they may be.\nAllow me to acquaint this Assembly with the\nachievements of the Government of Sudan in political,\neconomic and social fields. The priority item on my\nGovernment\u2019s agenda is to attain a just and lasting peace in\nsouthern Sudan and to put an end to the war that horrified\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ninnocent civilians and devastated their lives, the war that\nexposed them to the scourges of death, famine, disease and\ndisplacement. This war, which was the by-product of the\ncolonial conspiracy, has turned the citizens into recipients of\nrelief and made them dependent on others. It constitutes a\nperpetual squandering of vast resources that could have been\nutilized in economic and social development and for the\nwelfare of the Sudanese peoples in the south and the north.\nFaithful to its earnest endeavours to bring about a\npeaceful settlement of the discord in the south, the Sudanese\nGovernment has emphasized since 1989 its readiness to talk\npeace with the rebels without preconditions. The\nGovernment put forward a comprehensive framework for\npeace emanating from the recommendations of a national\nconference. This approach is based on remedying the\nlingering causes of the conflict in the areas of power- and\nwealth-sharing, relations between religion and State, adoption\nof the federal system of government to meet the aspirations\nof different regions for a genuine sharing of power, the\nexemption of the south from the application of Sharia laws\nand the redistribution and reallocation of resources for social\nand economic development on equitable grounds.\nIn this positive spirit the Government held several\nrounds of negotiations with the rebel movement. The last\nmeeting took place in Abuja with the mediation of sisterly\nNigeria. The Government, out of its keen desire to bring the\npeace talks to a successful conclusion, showed great\nflexibility, but it realized, unfortunately, that, owing to the\npressures of foreign interests, Garang\u2019s faction was not the\nmaster of its decision. That was why we could not reach an\nagreement in order to alleviate the suffering of our citizens\nin the south.\nThe failure of the second Abuja peace talks did not,\nhowever, weaken the determination of the Government to\ncontinue searching for peace through negotiations. To this\nend, the Government started a new round of negotiations,\nthis time in Sudanese territory, with the other united rebel\nfactions. The Government also accepted a quadrilateral\npeace initiative put forward by four Heads of State members\nof the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and\nDevelopment (IGADD): Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and\nEritrea. We believe that neighbouring countries are able and\nkeen to help in resolving this stalemate. Furthermore, the\nGovernment accepted the initiative of former President\nJimmy Carter in mediating between the Government and the\nrebel factions.\nIn the area of economic development, the Government\nof the Sudan adopted an ambitious three-year economic\nprogramme for the implementation of far-reaching reforms\nin the structure of the Sudanese economy by engaging in a\nfree-market policy, diminishing the role of the Government\nin trade and economic activities, and giving the private\nsector its due catalytic role in these activities.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 39\nEconomic and monetary regulations were enacted to\nencourage investment, especially in agriculture and animal\nproducts. This economic programme reaped its fruits, and\nwe have registered an increase of over 10 per cent in the\nrate of growth of the gross national product, as well as self-\nsufficiency in grain and sugar. This programme energized\nthe economy and led to the inflow of foreign investment,\nowing to the free-market policy, the reform of the\ninfrastructure and the building up of the capacity of human\nresources.\nAll these developments could have achieved positive\nresults, not for the benefit of the Sudanese people alone, but\nalso for the African and Arab regions, had they not been\nforestalled by political machinations in areas of international\ntrade and economic cooperation, as well as interference in\nthe work of the international monetary institutions. An\nunjust and undeclared economic embargo deprived the Sudan\nof development resources from bilateral and multilateral\ninstitutions. This unjust behaviour deprived the people of\nthe Sudan of their right to development, a right enshrined in\nall international conventions.\nIn the social field, the Government is very attentive to\nthe needs of the impoverished sector of the population.\nFinancial support is increasingly extended to them through\nZakat funds and social-welfare institutions. A number of\ncommercial subsidies were introduced to alleviate the\neconomic burden of a broad sector of the population.\nSalaries in the public and private sectors were increased and\nsubjected to continuous revision. All this was done in full\ncompliance with and respect for human dignity, and to\neliminate poverty.\nMoreover, in the area of legislation, the Government\nexcluded the States with non-Muslim majorities from being\nsubjected to Sharia laws.\nIn the area of human rights, a Supreme Council for\nHuman Rights was established, under the chairmanship of\nthe second-highest ranking official in the State.\nSecurity prevails throughout the country, the rule of law\nhas replaced chaos, and there have been other great\naccomplishments in the fields of education, literacy, health,\nenvironment, and the improvement of the living conditions\nof displaced persons and their relocation to ensure a\ndignified life while they await the elimination of the\nconditions that forced them to become displaced persons.\nThe position of Sudan has remained clear ever since the\ncommencement of the Arab-Israeli peace talks: we believe\nthat they should lead to the exercise of Arab and Palestinian\nrights based on the provisions of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978). Since\nthe signing of the Declaration of Principles of self-autonomy\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and\nIsrael, the Middle East and the Palestinians\u2019 cause have\nentered a new phase. The Arab League Council of\nMinisters, after its 100th meeting in Cairo, issued a\ncommuniqu\u00e9 on this agreement based on Security Council\nresolutions. The communiqu\u00e9 emphasized the necessity of\nan Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories\nin the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, the Golan\nHeights and southern Lebanon so as to open a new page in\nthe history of the Middle East and enable the people of the\nregion to work for development and prosperity. The Arab\nLeague Council considered the agreement a step forward\ntowards the establishment of a comprehensive peace in the\nregion, provided that other steps to complement it were\nguaranteed such as a complete Israeli withdrawal from the\noccupied Syrian Golan Heights, the West Bank, including\nJerusalem, and the territory in southern Lebanon.\nThe Arab world has articulated its judgement on this\nhistoric agreement and proved its sincerity about desiring a\njust, lasting and comprehensive settlement in the region. At\nthis critical point in time, we appeal to our Palestinian\nbrothers to consolidate their unity and unify their\ndeterminant objectives. They should close the doors against\nany attempts to divide them. The United Nations is called\nupon to supervise this peace plan by insisting on the\nimplementation of all its resolutions based on international\nlegitimacy. The custodians of this peace plan are also called\nupon to ensure an expeditious Israeli withdrawal from all the\noccupied Arab and Palestinian territories, in full compliance\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe positive developments taking place in South Africa\nas a result of the struggle of our brothers and sisters there in\ntheir quest for emancipation, equality and the rule of the\nmajority stand as proof of the important role the United\nNations can play in accordance with the principles of the\nCharter whenever a Member State shows the necessary\npolitical will. My delegation associates itself with the leader\nNelson Mandela in his call upon the international\nOrganization to secure the transitional arrangements leading\nto the emergence of a democratic, unified and non-racial\nSouth Africa.\nAs an African country, we believe that Africa has\ndemonstrated throughout history its unique ability to resolve\nAfrican disputes through African mediation. In this regard,\nI salute the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and Desertification\n(IGADD), the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and all other African subregional organizations,\nas well as various African States that have played leading\nroles in the peaceful settlement of several disputes in such\ncountries as Rwanda and Liberia,\nthus contributing to peace and stability in Africa. We hope\nthat peace will soon prevail in Angola, Mozambique and\nSomalia so that Africa can enjoy the stability that will enable\nit to meet the challenges of construction and development\nand move towards prosperity for the African people and\npeople of the whole world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with satisfaction that my\ndelegation and I would like to congratulate His Excellency\nAmbassador Samuel Insanally, on his election as President\nof the forty-eighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. I wish him success in discharging his duties.\nMy delegation is available and ready to cooperate with him\nin the task of ensuring a successful conclusion to this\nsession\u2019s deliberations.\nTo His Excellency Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria we extend\nour congratulations on the wonderful work he did as\nPresident of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly.\nI should like to take this opportunity to address my\nspecial appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali, the Secretary-General of our Organization, for his\nunflinching dedication in the search for solutions to the\nmany problems that affect humankind. I wish to reiterate\nour gratitude and appreciation for his personal commitment\nand dedication to the cause of peace and stability in my\ncountry.\nTo the new Member States which have just joined this\ngreat United Nations family we express our congratulations\nand our readiness to work with them to fulfil the objectives\nenshrined in the Charter of the Organization.\nWhen I last addressed the Assembly, in 1990, I had the\nopportunity to say that my Government had begun direct\nnegotiations with RENAMO with a view to putting an end\nto the long war of destruction and destabilization.\nFor my Government the dialogue had as it main\nobjective - besides ending the war - to restore peace,\nnormalize life and promote understanding among all citizens\nof Mozambique. These conditions are essential if the\nprocess of national reconstruction is to gain root and prosper.\nIt is worth indicating here that, for reasons alien to the\nGovernment, the dialogue with RENAMO was complex and\ntoo long. We wish to express our appreciation and thanks\nto the international community for its unwavering support,\nwhich helped us to conclude the negotiations successfully\nand sign the General Peace Agreement in Rome on 4\nOctober 1992.\nFor Mozambique the signing of the General Peace\nAgreement represents an important step in the life of its\npeople. With it, hopes for the Mozambicans to rebuild their\ncountry in a peaceful and harmonious environment were\nrenewed. The fact that almost one year has elapsed without\nany major breach of the cease-fire is reason for joy.\nWe are witnessing the revival of economic and social\nactivity in the country. The refugees have begun to return.\nDisplaced people are resettling in their areas of origin or in\nother areas of their choice. The reconstruction of roads,\nbridges, schools and health centres is under way in spite of\nthe shortage of financial and material resources with which\nthe country is confronted.\nThe flow of people and goods is increasing as the roads\nare reopening to traffic. We are witnessing a normal\nmovement of people all over the country, except in\nRENAMO-occupied areas. There is a growing interest on\nthe part of foreigners in seeking investment opportunities in\nMozambique.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe challenges ahead of us are enormous. The war of\ndestabilization that ravaged the country for more than 16\nyears has caused economic and social damage amounting to\nabout $20 billion. As a direct consequence of this war, 6\nmillion people were displaced or became refugees in\nneighbouring countries; more than 500,000 children became\norphans and an equal number were traumatized. In addition\nto this, 3000 primary schools and about 1000 health centres\nwere destroyed in rural areas. Together with this, power\nlines, sugar plants, tea factories - among others - bridges and\nmines were destroyed.\nMany agricultural and industrial activities of primary\nimportance were paralysed, thus reducing considerably our\ncapacity to export. Unemployment was aggravated. These\nare the problems we are endeavouring to solve as we\nproceed with the implementation of the General Peace\nAgreement. The demobilization of forces and their\neconomic and social reintegration require a tremendous\neffort on our part. As can be seen, these challenges cannot\nbe met successfully without the support of the Assembly.\nThe Government of Mozambique has approved a\nnational reconstruction plan the main objective of which is\nto reactivate the economic and social life of the population\nso that people may go from a situation in which they survive\non emergency aid to one of rehabilitation and sustained\ndevelopment. Thus, the aim of the plan is to put an end to\nthe structural poverty of the population by giving it the\nmeans it needs to relaunch productive activity and to become\nself-sufficient. We believe that in the medium term this plan\nwill contribute to a rapid expansion of essential services in\nrural areas as well as to that of overall economic and social\nactivity in the country in general.\nOn humanitarian assistance, it is worth noting that with\nthe support of the United Nations we drew up a consolidated\nprogramme for action in the repatriation process,\ndemobilization of military units, supply of emergency aid,\nre-establishment of essential services, and institutional\ncapacity-building in the country. Humanitarian assistance\nwill be required for some years to come until the whole\nprocess of resettlement of the population is completed.\nIn spite of these challenges the Government has\nproceeded with the implementation of the economic recovery\nprogramme, with the assistance of the World Bank, the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Economic\nCommunity (EEC) and other partners. After a decline in the\ngross domestic product last year we expect a slight growth\nof about 4 per cent this year thanks to peace and the good\nclimatic conditions we are enjoying in the country.\nWe are convinced that the success of present efforts\nand of the large national reconstruction plan will, to a great\nextent, depend on the creative spirit, determination and hard\nwork of all Mozambicans. On the other hand, the success\nof this same project will also depend on the generous\nsupport of the international community.\nWe appeal to our partners to provide timely assistance,\ninasmuch as the delays we are observing in delivering\nassistance already committed have, in many cases, been\npartly responsible for the weak performance of the economy,\nparticularly in the industrial sector.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to recognize and\nexpress our thanks to the United Nations, and to all those\ncountries that have contributed funds, resources and\npersonnel to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique\n(UNOMOZ). We equally thank them and the many non-\ngovernmental organizations that have been operating in the\ncountry for their assistance in successfully meeting these\nchallenges.\nWe have spoken about encouraging developments in\nMozambique. However, we regret to say that the other face\nof the situation in the country is a source of serious concern.\nAfter the international community succeeded in catching\nup with the initial delay in setting up the UNOMOZ\noperation, RENAMO found new pretexts to further protract\nand delay the implementation of the Peace Agreement. In\nits dilatory manoeuvres RENAMO is moving from\nprecondition to precondition, though many of the\npreconditions have nothing to do with the General Peace\nAgreement or are a blatant breach of it.\nFrom the very inception, RENAMO delayed sending\npersonnel to fill its positions in the commissions for the\nimplementation of the General Peace Agreement. At\npresent, RENAMO is stating reservations concerning\nSecurity Council resolution 863 (1993) on Mozambique, to\nwhich my Government fully subscribes. As members know,\nthat resolution calls, among other things, for urgent\nimplementation, without further preconditions, of the process\nof assembly and demobilization of forces and of beginning\nthe training of the new army.\nOn the consultations for the adoption of the draft\nelectoral law, RENAMO is raising difficulties that can\nhardly be understood, particularly with respect to the\ncomposition of the National Electoral Commission. The\norganization and holding of multiparty elections is a\nGovernment responsibility. The Government cannot excuse\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 7\nitself from that responsibility at a moment when the\nMozambicans and the international community as a whole\nare anxiously waiting to see the free and fair multiparty\nelections that are to be held not later than October 1994.\nWe cannot postpone the elections indefinitely. RENAMO\nmust be made to understand this. The Government will\ncontinue to engage in consultations, and will spare no effort\nto make sure that the elections are held at the proper time.\nThe overview we have just presented compels us to\nmake some observations on the situation in Angola and\nSouth Africa, given the affinities of the regional situation as\na whole. We are deeply concerned over the resumption of\nhostilities in Angola because they not only represent a\nserious threat to peace and to the future of the country but\nalso threaten to perpetuate tension and instability in the\nwhole region of southern Africa.\nWe continue to believe that compliance with the\nBicesse Accords, respect for the election results and the\nunconditional implementation of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions constitute a valid platform in the efforts\ntowards a lasting peace in Angola. We are hopeful that\ndialogue will prevail in the search for the best solutions to\nthe conflict in Angola.\nWithin that context, my Government fully subscribes to\nSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993). Strict observance of\nthe spirit and letter of that resolution by UNITA is a\nfundamental condition for an end to the protracted and\ndevastating war which is responsible for the great suffering\nof the Angolan people today. We also believe that\ncompliance with that resolution will certainly lead to\nhumanitarian assistance being channelled to the people in\ngreatest need. I would like to take this opportunity to\nreaffirm my Government\u2019s readiness to cooperate with the\nUnited Nations in the implementation of that resolution.\nWe have followed with great interest the talks within\nthe framework of the Multiparty Negotiating Forum in South\nAfrica. We would like to commend the decision taken by\nthat organ, specifically regarding the creation of the\nTransitional Executive Council soon to be established as a\ndecisive step in preparing for the first multiracial elections\nin the country\u2019s history.\nThe end of the apartheid system and the formation of\na democratically elected Government will greatly contribute\nto peace and stability in the region, thus enhancing the\nprospects for even more prosperous economic cooperation\nwithin the context of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC). The peoples of southern Africa have\nhigh hopes for that organization of regional economic\nintegration as a special forum for harmonizing their\neconomic and social development programmes. The region\npossesses enormous economic potential yet to be explored,\nand continues to call for investment in order to become a\nviable, more competitive economic partner in the\ninternational arena.\nOn the Middle East, we welcome the signing of the\nagreement between the Israeli Government and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization in Washington on 13 September\n1993. This agreement constitutes a historic and important\nlandmark on the road to the solution of the issues in the\nMiddle East conflict.\nThe question of East Timor, whose people shared with\nMozambique a common colonial history, remains\nunresolved. We encourage the ongoing dialogue between\nPortugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral, aimed at finding a solution that will safeguard the\nright of the Maub\u00e8re people to self-determination.\nWe are also convinced that, through dialogue, the other\nconflicts still prevailing in Africa and other continents will\ncome to satisfactory solutions.\nThe world economy continues to be characterized by\nstagnant growth with an increasing disparity in development\nlevels. Various factors on the international scene led to this\nstate of affairs. External debt constitutes one of the main\nobstacles to the economic growth of developing countries.\nThe external debt burden is aggravated by the deteriorating\nprices of basic export goods and by weak foreign investment\nin productive areas which could have a positive impact on\nthe balance of payments and on domestic savings. We\nbelieve, therefore, that the international community should\npay special attention to the external debt of the developing\ncountries and take necessary, adequate measures aimed at\nfinding a definitive solution to this crisis.\nMoreover, we have noted a decline in financial\nassistance to the developing countries; such assistance is\nbeing diverted to other countries, in Europe, at the very time\nwhen we are experiencing a reduction in the flow of official\ndevelopment assistance. This affects the economies of low-\nincome countries.\nNotwithstanding the enormous efforts undertaken in the\nstructural-adjustment process during the last decade, the\neconomic and social situation in Africa remains very serious.\nThe real economic growth rate in African countries remains\nfar behind the population growth rates. Per capita income\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nand other development factors continue to decrease, and\nremain among the lowest in the world.\nIf the alarming economic situation I have described is\nnot addressed by the international community, and reversed,\nthe peace dividends resulting from the end of the cold war\nand from the progress of the democratic process world wide\nwill not benefit all the peoples of the world.\nIt is in this context that we support the efforts to\nproduce a solid consensus on a development agenda to the\nbenefit during this session of the General Assembly.\nWe also believe that a speedy conclusion of the\nUruguay Round of negotiations would contribute to a\nsolution of the problems relating to international trade that\naffect the world economy.\nWith regard to environment, the Republic of\nMozambique has established a National Commission for\nEnvironment to look after issues in this area. The\nimplementation of \\\"Agenda 21\\\" in Mozambique has a legal\nbasis within the Republic\u2019s Constitution, which contains\nprovisions relating to the management of natural resources\nand environment in general. The National Commission for\nEnvironment is at present working on harmonizing measures\naimed at integrating environmental aspects into economic\nand social programmes, and it is also producing a National\nPlan for Environment Management, whose main objective is\nthe promotion of the country\u2019s sustained development. In\norder to fulfil international obligations in this regard,\nMozambique is making the necessary preparations to adhere\nto the main international Conventions and other agreements\non environment.\nA brief appreciation of the international situation shows\nthat the era of bipolarity has given way to the beginning of\nan era characterized by dialogue in international cooperation,\nparticularly in joint efforts to face the problems affecting\npeace, international security and economic and social\ndevelopment.\nSolving the problems we face today requires the\npromotion of cooperative relations, based on\ninterdependence, complementarity and mutual benefit\nbetween nations.\nIn various parts of the world significant steps have been\ntaken bearing testimony to the prevailing political will for,\nand commitment to, political, economic and social\ndemocratization. However, these efforts are faced with\nsocial problems deriving from the institutional and economic\nfragility of the States involved. It is therefore imperative\nthat the international community take cognizance of these\ndifficulties and adopt measures in support of those efforts.\nThe new challenges we are facing today lead us to\nbelieve even more in the United Nations as the most\nprivileged forum for harmonizing the global interests of all\npeoples of the world, with the aim of fostering an\ninternational environment in conformity with the noble\nprinciples and objectives enshrined in its Charter.\nIn conclusion, I should like to highlight the importance\nof peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance in the world,\nand especially in my own country. In this regard I appeal to\nMember States to redirect their efforts and resources in order\nto strengthen further the United Nations.\nTo this end, we should like to appeal to all Member\nStates to channel material and financial resources to the\nUnited Nations so that its role as the guardian of\ninternational peace and security may continue to be\nstrengthened.\n"

Guatemala wishes to extend\nto them its friendship, respect, solidarity and understanding.\nThe increase in its membership is further proof of the faith\nthe international community places in the United Nations as\na multilateral forum par excellence for seeking together the\nsolution to the problems that beset the world today.\nI would also like to extend my greetings to\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United\nNations, whose dynamic leadership has allowed us to\nprogress towards the common objective of strengthening our\nOrganization and adapting it to the new world situation. We\nhope that his efforts to ensure fulfilment of the Charter and\nof its purposes and principles will be successful. We need\na strengthened Organization to maintain international peace\nand security and to promote social progress and better\nstandards of life for human beings within the widest concept\nof freedom.\nWe believe that the continuous dialogue between the\nSecretariat and the Member States should be based on\nmutual respect, confidence and understanding, and should\ntake into account cultural, political, economic and social\nrealities. The Secretary-General\u2019s role as a facilitator of\npeace processes, as an adviser on human rights and as a\nmediator in international conflicts may be strengthened by\nthe contribution of distinguished statesmen and experts who\nshare with him their experience and prestige.\nThe events which have taken place in my country since\n25 May of this year have marked a fundamental change in\nthe political and institutional life of Guatemala.\nThe breaking-off and subsequent restoration of\nconstitutional order created a situation in which the people\nof Guatemala, as the country\u2019s only sovereigns, exercised\nlegitimate resistance in order to protect and defend their\nrights and guarantees enshrined in the political Constitution\nof the Republic.\nAs one of the principal consequences of these events,\nwith a view to consolidating the restoration of constitutional\norder so as to reinstall the Congress of the Republic, the\npolitical parties formally pledged in writing to purge the\nmembership of that body.\nSince this commitment has not yet been fulfilled,\nPresident Ramiro de Le\u00f3n Carpio, as Head of State and the\nrepresentative of national unity and the interests of the\npeople of Guatemala, in accordance with the Constitution,\nrequested the supreme electoral tribunal to hold a vote so\nthat the citizens could express their will with regard to the\npolitical decision of calling for the resignation of the sitting\nmembers of the Congress and the judges of the Supreme\nCourt. This vote, in conformity with the resolution of the\ntribunal, will be held on 28 November this year.\nThis process has no precedent in our political history.\nWe wish to stress that all the actions taken by the\nGovernment of the Republic fall strictly within the\nframework of the Constitution, and, though the people of\nGuatemala may have opted for a slower path, through\nlegality, to consolidate their democratic institutions, we are\nsure that this will be the best solution for the reconciliation\nof the Guatemalan family and the political stability of the\nState. Guatemala is charting its own course, and its political\nprocess cannot be compared with other realities.\nYesterday, President Ramirio de Le\u00f3n Carpio presented\nthe National Peace Plan and the Official Declaration on\nHuman Rights to the Guatemalan people, as he does today,\nthrough me, to the international community. President Le\u00f3n\nde Carpio\u2019s Plan seeks a firm peace, based on far-reaching\nreconciliation through dialogue, so that we Guatemalans can\nfind unity in the diversity of our cultural, ethnic, religious,\nsocial, political, economic and ecological values.\nIt seeks lasting peace, achieved by putting an end to\narmed internal confrontation and seeing to it that the roots\nof hatred, resentment and distrust that have divided us are\nextirpated through negotiation and never again by violence.\nIt seeks a peace with the power to transform, achieved\nby consensus and national compromise, which will lead to\nthe strengthening of the capacity of the Government and the\nsociety as a whole to respond promptly and effectively to\nsocial requirements, with particular attention to the sectors\nof the population most affected by the armed internal\nconfrontation.\nThe first component is reconciliation. The Plan\nconsiders it essential to establish and promote the\nfunctioning in Guatemala of the permanent forum for peace.\nThis forum will help to facilitate dialogue and ensure the\nparticipation of all Guatemalans in the solution of national\nproblems. This reconciliation process will be promoted at\nthe national, regional, departmental, municipal and\ncommunal levels. Thus, consensus and agreements will\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9\nexpress needs that are truly felt by the people and will at the\nsame time provide guidelines for joint action by the people\nand the Government to solve these problems. In this\ndecentralization strategy, we shall make use of all\nmechanisms for making the community\u2019s voice heard,\nincluding urban and rural development councils.\nIn those councils national problems will be discussed in\norder to arrive at conclusions that will lead to the perfecting\nof our democracy, the strengthening of a State based on the\nrule of law, the full exercise of individual freedoms, respect\nfor human rights, integrated, self-reliant and self-sustaining\ndevelopment with equality and justice and the solution to\nproblems deriving from our cultural diversity.\nWe must link this permanent forum to previous\nachievements of the peace process. To this end, account\nshould be taken, inter alia, of the contributions made to the\ngreat national dialogue and to the meetings that various\nsectors of the Guatemalan population had with the\nGuatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG).\nWhen that group integrates itself legally it will be able,\nthrough the national reconciliation commission, to present its\nideas and proposals for subjects to be dealt with in the\nforum.\nThe matter of social requirements calls for honest,\nefficient and immediate actions by the Government to\nstrengthen the protection and defence of human rights,\nactions that will reduce poverty indicators and promote\ndevelopment in the areas worst affected by violence and that\nwill succeed in perfecting our democratic system. At the\nsame time, the Government will promote and support\nresponsible action in these fields by all sectors of society.\nWe hope the valuable support of the international\ncommunity will be added to this effort of the people and the\nGovernment, which will contribute to a prompt and effective\nresponse to the needs and requirements of the population.\nWe cannot postpone the end of the armed confrontation,\nwhich requires the restoration of the negotiation process to\nbring about a definitive cease-fire; the return of the URNG\nto legality by means of amnesty; the defining of the\nconditions necessary for its integration into the country\u2019s\npolitical life; and, in consequence, its direct participation in\nthe permanent peace forum.\nWe shall also define the international verification\nmachinery which will make possible the concentration,\ndisarmament and demobilization of URNG personnel. To\nachieve this, there must be an end to acts of terrorism, acts\nof destruction against the infrastructure and actions that harm\nthe environment.\nThe process also requires, first, that there be a revision\nof the Oslo and Mexico City accords and, secondly, that a\ntimetable for negotiations be set.\nOn the question of human rights, the Government has\ndeclared that it will act firmly against violations of these\nrights, with no distinction as to social or economic status.\nThe necessary measures will be taken to protect and support\npersons and entities that are working in accordance with the\nlaw to promote and safeguard human rights. We therefore\ncall upon the United Nations, the Organization of American\nStates (OAS) and the States members of these organizations\nto increase their presence and technical contributions to\nactions that the State of Guatemala and its institutions\nundertake to strengthen, enable and perfect the machinery for\nprotecting and defending human rights.\nOn behalf of my Government, I request the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations to seek a meeting with the\nURNG to undertake a review of the Oslo and Mexico City\naccords and to set a timetable for negotiations. The\nGovernment of Guatemala is proposing this Peace Plan,\naware as it is of the imperative necessity for putting an end\nonce and for all to armed confrontation, which has cost my\ncountry so many human lives over the course of more than\n30 years. Only a sturdy, lasting peace with power to\ntransform can serve as a basis to strengthen democratic\ninstitutions, guarantee respect for human rights and promote\npolitical, economic and social development.\nFor all of the above reasons we most warmly welcome\nthe peace process that has been attained in the sister\nRepublic of El Salvador and the one recently initiated\nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization.\nGuatemala reaffirms its faith and conviction regarding\nthe guiding principles set out in the Charter of the United\nNations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\noutstanding among which are the principle of the peaceful\nsolution of disputes, the right to self-determination, the\nsovereign equality of States and, fundamentally, the respect\nfor human rights and the principle of democratic\nGovernment.\nIn keeping with the principle of universality prevailing\nin the current international context, our country considers\nthat cases like that of the Republic of China in Taiwan\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nshould be thoroughly studied and considered in the light of\nthe United Nations Charter. Guatemala renews its faith and\nhope in multilateralism, and particularly in the United\nNations. It wishes to stress its tradition of peace, dialogue\nand negotiation and the non-use of force in international\nrelations.\nThe security of nations is no longer an exclusively\ngeopolitical matter falling within the framework of bipolar\nconfrontation. It is a global problem within which we must\ntackle the problems that afflict today\u2019s world. The concept\nof security should include new elements that are fundamental\nfor the peoples of the world: democracy, development, the\npreservation of the environment, combating drug trafficking,\nfood security, population trends and so on.\nThe Secretariat should be in the service of Member\nStates and in that role should facilitate instruments that will\nmake it possible to maintain international peace and security\nand promote economic cooperation and social development,\nwhich will guarantee the full exercise of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms throughout the world.\nGuatemala believes that, within the process of\nrestructuring and reorganizing the United Nations that is\ncurrently under way, the efficiency of the system and the full\nand democratic participation of all its Members should be\nsecured. Democratization, as a fundamental element in the\ndevelopment of peoples, must coexist with development of\nthe international community and its multilateral system.\nWe support the initiative to expand the membership of\nthe Security Council from a regional perspective.\nOperations designed to contain or solve conflicts should\nbe matters for priority action by the United Nations as part\nof the Organization\u2019s efforts to forge a new world order.\nAmong the problems of development are to be found\nmany of the causes of regional, national and international\ntension. Development must be the central focus of the\nefforts of the Organization. We therefore support the\nholding of a World Summit for Social Development, and we\nhope that the Secretary-General will submit the proposed\nagenda for development, embracing economic affairs that\nhave traditionally been assigned to the Organization, as well\nas social, political, environmental and cultural matters, which\nwe are beginning to realize are fundamental elements in the\nwelfare of peoples.\nThe well-being of mankind depends in large measure\non the rational use of available natural resources. With\nregard to ecology, we need a global perspective, as the\nenvironment is the heritage of all mankind. If the benefits\nare enjoyed by all, the effort should be shared. The\ndeveloped world must work more closely and more\neffectively in financing the various programmes to preserve\nthe environment of the developing countries and must\nhonour the commitments given in Rio de Janeiro.\nNational and international security are threatened\nprimarily by differences between the levels of development\nof countries. Effective action must be taken against poverty,\nhunger, disease and illiteracy. These scourges are worsening\nwhere there are concentrations of refugees or displaced\npersons. Cooperation must not be delayed. For this reason,\nGuatemala hopes that the initiative of reactivating the North-\nSouth dialogue to strengthen international economic\ncooperation for development and to revitalize global\neconomic growth, as formulated by the Non-Aligned\nMovement and the Group of 77, will be agreed to and will\nlead to the creation of a better world.\nThe developing countries must refine the machinery for\npolitical and economic coordination to enable us to get this\ndialogue going seriously and constructively. It is therefore\nessential that international economic cooperation be\nstrengthened to revitalize global economic growth and to\nensure that the technological revolution that is under way\nwill be one more factor in the promotion of a just and\nequitable world order.\nWe must not overlook the fact that the problems of\nnational development are to be found also in the Central\nAmerican region. International cooperation is necessary for\nthe consolidation of peace and to encourage the development\nof the region. Meetings of Presidents of Central American\nStates continue to be held regularly. Due note has been\ntaken of regional political advances, and proposals for\nfurther improvement in this field have been put forward. A\nsummit meeting of Central American Presidents will be held\nin Guatemala at the end of this month for the purpose of\nadopting the Protocol to the General Treaty on Central\nAmerican Economic Integration, whose aim is to encourage\nsocial development - a priority when it comes to\nconsolidating peace in Central America.\nThe Central American effort at integration has been\nintensified. The Central American Integration System,\nwhich coordinates efforts at regional integration and is\ntherefore a fundamental instrument in the process of regional\ndevelopment, now has a Secretary-General.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11\nIt has been proposed that a coordinated Central\nAmerican fund to fight poverty be set up. This proposal will\nbe studied at the next Summit of Central American\nPresidents.\nGuatemala supports economic openness so that its\neconomy may be integrated effectively into the sphere of\nworld trade. Along with the other Central American\ncountries, we have made progress in establishing an\nintegrated economic space, and we are negotiating with\ncountries and groups of countries with a view to concluding\nagreements on the liberalization of trade.\nThe Government that I represent has embarked upon a\nprocess of restructuring and consolidating its democratic\ninstitutions. Keeping faith with the Constitution of the\nRepublic, it has today, with the greatest good will and good\nfaith, presented its plan for peace. This is designed to save\nmany lives and to bring to our country the longed-for peace,\nwhich cannot be achieved without the wholehearted support\nof the international community.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first congratulate you,\nSir, on your election as President of the General Assembly\nfor this session.\nMr. Secretary-General, distinguished representatives and\nguests, it is a great honour for me to address you and to\nstand in this great Hall, which symbolizes so much of the\ntwentieth century - its darkest crises and its brightest\naspirations.\nI come before you as the first American President born\nafter the founding of the United Nations. Like most of the\npeople in the world today, I was not even alive during the\nconvulsive world war that convinced humankind of the need\nfor this Organization, nor during the San Francisco\nConference that led to its birth. Yet I have followed the\nwork of the United Nations throughout my life, with\nadmiration for its accomplishments, sadness for its failures\nand the conviction that, through common effort, our\ngeneration can take the bold steps needed to redeem the\nmission entrusted to the United Nations 48 years ago. I\npledge to you that my nation remains committed to helping\nmake the United Nations vision a reality.\nThe start of this session of the General Assembly offers\nus an opportunity to take stock of where we are as common\nshareholders in the progress of humankind and the\npreservation of our planet. It is clear that we live at a\nturning point in human history.\nImmense and promising changes seem to wash over us\nevery day. The cold war is over. The world is no longer\ndivided into two armed and angry camps. Dozens of new\ndemocracies have been born.\nIt is a moment of miracles. We see Nelson Mandela\nstand side by side with President de Klerk proclaiming a\ndate for South Africa\u2019s first non-racial elections.\nWe see Russia\u2019s first popularly elected President,\nBoris Yeltsin, leading his nation on its bold democratic\njourney.\nWe have seen decades of deadlock shattered in the\nMiddle East as the Prime Minister of Israel and the\nChairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization reached\npast enmity and suspicion to shake each other\u2019s hand and\nexhilarate the entire world with the hope of peace.\nWe have begun to see the doomsday weapons of\nnuclear annihilation dismantled and destroyed. Thirty-two\nyears ago President Kennedy warned this Assembly that\nhumanity lived under a nuclear sword of Damocles that hung\nby the slenderest of threads. Now the United States is\nworking with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others to take\nthat sword down, to lock it away in a secure vault, where we\nhope and pray it will remain for ever.\nIt is a new era in this Hall as well. The super-Power\nstandoff that for so long stymied the work of the United\nNations, almost from its first day, has now yielded to a new\npromise of practical cooperation.\nYet today we must all admit that there are two\npowerful tendencies working from opposite directions to\nchallenge the authority of nation States everywhere and to\nundermine the authority of nation States to work together.\nFrom beyond nations, economic and technological forces all\nover the globe are compelling the world towards integration.\nThese forces are fuelling a welcome explosion of\nentrepreneurship and political liberalization. But they also\nthreaten to destroy the insularity and independence of\nnational economies, quickening the pace of change and\nmaking many of our people feel more insecure. At the same\ntime, from within nations, the resurgent aspirations of ethnic\nand religious groups challenge Governments on terms that\ntraditional nation States cannot easily accommodate. These\ntwin forces lie at the heart of the challenges, not only to our\nnational Governments, but also to all our international\ninstitutions. They require all of us in this Hall to find new\nways to work together more effectively in pursuit of our\nnational interests and to think anew about whether our\ninstitutions of international cooperation are adequate to this\nmoment.\nThus, as we marvel at this era\u2019s promise of new peace,\nwe must also recognize that serious threats remain. Bloody\nethnic, religious and civil wars rage from Angola to the\nCaucasus to Kashmir. As weapons of mass destruction fall\ninto more hands, even small conflicts can threaten to take on\nmurderous proportions. Hunger and disease continue to take\na tragic toll, especially among the world\u2019s children. The\nmalignant neglect of our global environment threatens our\nchildren\u2019s health and their very security. The repression of\nconscience continues in too many nations. And terrorism,\nwhich has taken so many innocent lives, assumed a\nhorrifying immediacy for us here when militant fanatics\nbombed the World Trade Center and planned to attack even\nthis very Hall of peace.\nLet me assure the Assembly that whether they be the\nplotters of those crimes or the mass murderers who bombed\nPan Am flight 103, my Government is determined to see that\nsuch terrorists are brought to justice.\nAt this moment of panoramic change, of vast\nopportunities and troubling threats, we must all ask ourselves\nwhat we can and what we should do as a community of\nnations. We must once again dare to dream of what might\nbe, for our dreams may be within our reach.\nFor that to happen, we must all be willing honestly to\nconfront the challenges of the broader world. That has never\nbeen easy. When this Organization was founded 48 years\nago, the world\u2019s nations stood devastated by war or\nexhausted by its expense. There was little appetite for\ncooperative efforts among nations; most people simply\nwanted to get on with their lives. But a far-sighted\ngeneration of leaders from the United States and elsewhere\nrallied the world. Their efforts built the institutions of post-\n-war security and prosperity.\nWe are at a similar moment today. The momentum of\nthe cold war no longer propels us in our daily actions. And\nwith daunting economic and political pressures upon almost\nevery nation represented in this room, many of us are\nturning to focus greater attention and energy on domestic\nneeds and problems, and we must.\nBut putting each of our economic houses in order\ncannot mean that we shut our windows to the world. The\npursuit of self-renewal in many of the world\u2019s largest and\nmost powerful economies - in Europe, in Japan, in North\nAmerica - is absolutely crucial, because unless the great\nindustrial nations can recapture their robust economic\ngrowth, the global economy will languish. Yet the industrial\nnations also need growth elsewhere in order to lift their own.\nIndeed, prosperity in each of our nations and regions also\ndepends on active and responsible engagement in a host of\nshared concerns: for example, a thriving and democratic\nRussia not only makes the world safer, it also can help to\nexpand the world\u2019s economy; a strong GATT (General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement will create\nmillions of jobs world wide; peace in the Middle East,\nbuttressed as it should be by the repeal of outdated United\nNations resolutions, can help to unleash that region\u2019s great\neconomic potential and calm a perpetual source of tension in\nglobal affairs; and the growing economic power of China -\ncoupled with greater political openness - could bring\nenormous benefits to all of Asia and to the rest of the world.\nWe must help our publics to understand this distinction:\ndomestic renewal is an overdue tonic; but isolationism and\nprotectionism are still poison. We must inspire our peoples\nto look beyond their immediate fears towards a broader\nhorizon.\nLet me start by being clear about where the United\nStates stands. The United States occupies a unique position\nin world affairs today: we recognize that and we welcome\nit. Yet, with the cold war over, I know many people ask\nwhether the United States plans to retreat or remain active\nin the world; and if active, to what end? Many people are\nasking that in our own country as well.\nLet me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I\ncan. The United States intends to remain engaged and to\nlead. We cannot solve every problem, but we must and will\nserve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace.\nIn a new era of peril and opportunity, our overriding\npurpose must be to expand and strengthen the world\u2019s\ncommunity of market-based democracies. During the cold\nwar, we sought to contain a threat to the survival of free\ninstitutions; now we seek to enlarge the circle of nations that\nlive under those free institutions.\nFor our dream is of a day when the opinions and\nenergies of every person in the world will be given full\nexpression, in a world of thriving democracies that cooperate\nwith each other and live in peace.\nWith this statement, I do not mean to announce some\ncrusade to force our way of life and doing things on others\nor to replicate our institutions. But we now know clearly\nthat throughout the world, from Poland to Eritrea, from\nGuatemala to South Korea, there is an enormous yearning\namong people who wish to be the masters of their own\neconomic and political lives. Where it matters most and\nwhere we can make the greatest difference, we will therefore\npatiently and firmly align ourselves with that yearning.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 9\nToday, there are still those who claim that democracy\nis simply not applicable to many cultures and that its recent\nexpansion is an aberration, an accident in history that will\nsoon fade away. But I agree with President Roosevelt, who\nonce said: \\\"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent\nphase of human history. It is human history.\\\"\nWe will work to strengthen the free market democracies\nby revitalizing our economy at home, by opening world\ntrade through GATT, the North American Free Trade\nAgreement and other accords, and by updating our shared\ninstitutions, asking with you and answering the hard\nquestions about whether they are adequate to the present\nchallenges.\nWe will support the consolidation of market democracy\nwhere it is taking new root, as in the States of the former\nSoviet Union and all over Latin America, and we seek to\nfoster the practices of good government that distribute the\nbenefits of democracy and economic growth fairly to all\npeople.\nWe will work to reduce the threat from regimes that are\nhostile to democracy and to support liberalization of\nnon-democratic States when they are willing to live in peace\nwith the rest of us. As a country that has over 150 racial,\nethnic and religious groups within our borders, our policy is\nand must be rooted in a profound respect for all the world\u2019s\nreligions and cultures. But we must oppose everywhere\nextremism that produces terrorism and hate.\nAnd we must pursue our humanitarian goals of\nreducing suffering, fostering sustainable development and\nimproving health and living conditions, particularly for our\nworld\u2019s children.\nOn efforts from export controls to trade agreements to\npeace-keeping, we will often work in partnership with others\nand through multilateral institutions such as the United\nNations. It is in our national interest to do so. But we must\nnot hesitate to act unilaterally when there is a threat to our\ncore interests or to those of our allies.\nThe United States believes that an expanding\ncommunity of market democracies not only serves our own\nsecurity interests, it also advances the goals enshrined in this\nbody\u2019s Charter and its Universal Declaration of Human\nRights.\nFor broadly based prosperity is clearly the strongest\nform of preventive diplomacy, and the habits of democracy\nare the habits of peace. Democracy is rooted in\ncompromise, not conquest. It rewards tolerance, not hatred.\nDemocracies rarely wage war on one another. They make\nmore reliable partners in trade, in diplomacy, and in the\nstewardship of our global environment. And democracies,\nwith the rule of law and respect for political, religious and\ncultural minorities, are more responsive to their own people\nand to the protection of human rights.\nBut as we work towards this vision, we must confront\nthe storm clouds that may overwhelm our work and darken\nthe march towards freedom.\nIf we do not stem the proliferation of the world\u2019s\ndeadliest weapons, no democracy can feel secure.\nIf we do not strengthen the capacity to resolve conflicts\namong and within nations, those conflicts will smother the\nbirth of free institutions, threaten the development of entire\nregions and continue to take innocent lives.\nIf we do not nurture our people and our planet through\nsustainable development, we will deepen conflict and waste\nthe very wonders that make our efforts worth doing.\nLet me talk more about what I believe we must do in\neach of these three categories: non-proliferation, conflict\nresolution and sustainable development.\nOne of our most urgent priorities must be attacking the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - whether\nnuclear, chemical or biological - and the ballistic missiles\nthat can rain them down on populations hundreds of miles\naway.\nWe know this is not an idle problem. All of us are still\nhaunted by the pictures of Kurdish women and children cut\ndown by poison gas. We saw SCUD missiles drop during\nthe Gulf War that would have been far graver in their\nconsequences if they had carried nuclear weapons. And we\nknow that many nations still believe it is in their interests to\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction or to sell them or the\nnecessary technologies to others for financial gain.\nMore than a score of nations likely possess such\nweapons and their number threatens to grow. These\nweapons destabilize entire regions. They could turn a local\nconflict into a global human and environmental catastrophe.\nWe simply have got to find ways to control these weapons\nand to reduce the number of States that possess them by\nsupporting and strengthening the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency and by taking other necessary measures.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nI have made non-proliferation one of our nation\u2019s\nhighest priorities. We intend to weave it more deeply into\nthe fabric of all of our relationships with the world\u2019s nations\nand institutions. We seek to build a world of increasing\npressure for non-proliferation but increasingly open trade and\ntechnology for those States that live by accepted\ninternational rules.\nToday, let me describe several new policies that our\nGovernment will pursue to stem proliferation. We will\npursue new steps to control the materials for nuclear\nweapons. Growing global stockpiles of plutonium and\nhighly enriched uranium are raising the danger of nuclear\nterrorism for all nations. We will press for an international\nagreement that would ban production of these materials for\nweapons for ever.\nAs we reduce our nuclear stockpiles, the United States\nhas also begun negotiations towards a comprehensive ban on\nnuclear testing. This summer I declared that to facilitate\nthose negotiations, our nation would suspend our testing if\nall other nuclear States would do the same. Today, in the\nface of disturbing signs, I renew my call on the nuclear\nStates to abide by that moratorium as we negotiate to stop\nnuclear testing for all time.\nI am also proposing new efforts to fight the\nproliferation of biological and chemical weapons. Today,\nonly a handful of nations has ratified the chemical weapons\nConvention. I call on all nations - including my own - to\nratify this accord quickly so that it may enter into force by\n13 January 1995. We will also seek to strengthen the\nbiological weapons Convention by making every nation\u2019s\nbiological activities and facilities open to more international\nscrutiny.\nI am proposing as well new steps to thwart the\nproliferation of ballistic missiles. Recently, working with\nRussia, Argentina, Hungary and South Africa, we have made\nsignificant progress toward that goal. Now we will seek to\nstrengthen the principles of the Missile Technology Control\nRegime by transforming it from an agreement on technology\ntransfer among just 23 nations into a set of rules that can\ncommand universal adherence.\nWe will also reform our own system of export controls\nin the United States to reflect the realities of the post-cold-\nwar world, where we seek to enlist the support of our former\nadversaries in the battle against proliferation. At the same\ntime as we stop deadly technologies from falling into the\nwrong hands, we will work with our partners to remove\noutdated controls that unfairly burden legitimate commerce\nand unduly restrain growth and opportunity all over the\nworld.\nAs we work to keep the world\u2019s most destructive\nweapons out of conflicts, we must also strengthen the\ninternational community\u2019s ability to address those conflicts\nthemselves. For as we all now know so painfully, the end\nof the cold war did not bring us to the millennium of peace.\nIndeed, it simply removed the lid from many cauldrons of\nethnic, religious and territorial animosity.\nThe philosopher Isaiah Berlin has said that a wounded\nnationalism is like a bent twig, forced down so severely that\nwhen released, it lashes back with fury. The world today is\nthick with both bent and recoiling twigs of wounded\ncommunal identities. This surge of bitter conflicts has\nplaced high demands on the United Nations peace-keeping\nforces. Frequently, the Blue Helmets have worked wonders.\nIn Namibia, El Salvador, the Golan Heights and elsewhere,\nUnited Nations peace-keepers have helped to stop the\nfighting, restore civil authority and enable free elections. In\nBosnia, United Nations peace-keepers, against the danger\nand frustration of that continuing tragedy, have maintained\na valiant humanitarian effort. And if the parties to that\nconflict take the hard steps needed to make a real peace, the\ninternational community - including the United States - must\nbe ready to help in its effective implementation.\nIn Somalia, the United States and the United Nations\nhave worked together to achieve a stunning humanitarian\nrescue, saving literally hundreds of thousands of lives and\nrestoring conditions of security to almost the entire country.\nUnited Nations peace-keepers from over two dozen nations\nremain in Somalia today - and some, including brave\nAmericans, have lost their lives - to ensure that we complete\nour mission and that anarchy and starvation do not return\njust as quickly as they were abolished.\nMany still criticize United Nations peace-keeping, but\nthose who do should talk to the people of Cambodia, where\nthe United Nations operations helped turn the killing fields\ninto fertile soil for reconciliation. Last May\u2019s elections in\nCambodia marked a proud accomplishment for that war--\nweary nation and for the United Nations. And I am pleased\nto announce that the United States has recognized\nCambodia\u2019s new Government.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping holds the promise to\nresolve many of this era\u2019s conflicts. But the reason we have\nsupported such missions is not, as some critics in the United\nStates have charged, to subcontract American foreign policy,\nbut to strengthen our security, to protect our interests, and to\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\nshare among nations the costs and effort of pursuing peace.\nPeace-keeping cannot be a substitute for our own national\ndefence efforts, but it can strongly supplement them.\nToday there is wide recognition that the United Nations\npeace-keeping ability has not kept pace with its rising\nresponsibilities and challenges. Just six years ago, about\n10,000 United Nations peace-keepers were stationed around\nthe world. Today the United Nations has some 80,000\ndeployed in 17 operations on four continents. Yet until\nrecently, if a peace-keeping commander called in from\nacross the globe when it was night-time here in New York,\nthere was no one in the peace-keeping office even to answer\nthe call. When lives are on the line, we cannot let the reach\nof the United Nations exceed its grasp.\nAs the Secretary-General and others have argued, if\nUnited Nations peace-keeping is to be a sound security\ninvestment for our nation and for other United Nations\nMembers, it must adapt to new times. Together, we must\nprepare United Nations peace-keeping for the twenty-first\ncentury. We need to begin by bringing the rigours of\nmilitary and political analysis to every United Nations peace\nmission. In recent weeks in the Security Council, our nation\nhas begun asking harder questions about proposals for new\npeace-keeping missions. Is there a real threat to\ninternational peace? Does the proposed mission have clear\nobjectives? Can an end point be identified for those who\nwill be asked to participate? How much will the mission\ncost? From now on the United Nations should address these\nand other questions for every proposed mission before we\nvote and before the mission begins. The United Nations\nsimply cannot become engaged in every one of the world\u2019s\nconflicts. If the American people are to say \\\"Yes\\\" to United\nNations peace-keeping, the United Nations must know when\nto say \\\"No\\\".\nThe United Nations also must have the technical means\nto run a modern, world-class peace-keeping operation. We\nsupport the creation of a genuine United Nations peace-\nkeeping headquarters with a planning staff; with access to\ntimely intelligence; with a logistics unit that can be deployed\non a moment\u2019s notice; and with a modern operations centre\nwith global communications.\nUnited Nations operations must not only be adequately\nfunded but also fairly funded. Within the next few weeks,\nthe United States will be current on our peace-keeping bills.\nI have worked hard with the Congress to get this done. I\nbelieve the United States should lead the way in being\ntimely in its payments, and I will work to ensure that we\ncontinue to pay our peace-keeping bills in full. But I am\nalso committed to working with the United Nations to reduce\nour nation\u2019s assessment for these missions. The assessment\nsystem has not been changed since 1973, and everyone in\nour country knows that our percentage of the world\u2019s\neconomic pie is not as great as it was then. Therefore, I\nbelieve our rate should be reduced to reflect the rise of other\nnations that can now bear more of the financial burden.\nThat will make it easier for me as President to make sure\nmy country pays in a timely and full fashion.\nChanges in the United Nations peace-keeping operations\nmust be part of an even broader programme of United\nNations reform. I say that, again, not to criticize the United\nNations but to help improve it. As our Ambassador,\nMadeleine Albright, has suggested, the United States has\nalways played a twin role in regard to the United Nations:\n\\\"First friend and first critic.\\\"\nToday, corporations around the world are finding ways\nto move from the industrial age into the information age -\nimproving service, reducing bureaucracy and cutting costs.\nHere in the United States, Vice President Al Gore and I have\nlaunched an effort literally to reinvent how our Government\noperates. We see this going on in other Governments\naround the world. Now the time has come to reinvent the\nway the United Nations operates as well.\nI applaud the initial steps the Secretary-General has\ntaken to reduce and reform the United Nations bureaucracy.\nNow we must all do even more to root out waste. Before\nthis General Assembly is over, let us establish a strong\nmandate for an office of inspector general, so that it can\nattain a reputation for toughness, for integrity, for\neffectiveness. Let us build new confidence among our\npeople that the United Nations is changing with the needs of\nour times.\nUltimately, the key for reforming the United Nations,\nas for reforming our own government, is to remember why\nwe are here and whom we serve. It is well to recall that the\nfirst words of the United Nations Charter are not, \\\"We the\nGovernments\\\", but \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\nThat means, in every country, the teachers, the workers, the\nfarmers, the professionals, the fathers, the mothers, the\nchildren, from the most remote village in the world to the\nlargest metropolis - they are why we gather in this great\nHall; it is their futures that are at risk when we act or fail to\nact; and it is they who ultimately pay our bills.\nAs we dream new dreams in this age when miracles\nseem possible, let us focus on the lives of those people, and\nespecially on the children who will inherit this world. Let\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nus work with a new urgency, and imagine what kind of\nworld we could create for them over the coming generation.\nLet us work with new energy to protect the world\u2019s\npeople from torture and repression. As Secretary of State\nChristopher stressed at the recent Vienna Conference, human\nrights are not something conditional, bounded by culture but,\nrather, something universal, granted by God. This General\nAssembly should create, at long last, a high commissioner\nfor human rights. I hope it will do this soon, and with\nvigour and energy and conviction.\nLet us also work far more ambitiously to fulfil our\nobligations as custodians of this planet, not only to improve\nthe quality of life for our citizens and the quality of our air,\nwater and the earth itself, but also because the roots of\nconflict are so often entangled with the roots of\nenvironmental neglect and the calamities of famine and\ndisease.\nDuring the course of our campaign in the United States\nlast year, Vice President Gore and I promised the American\npeople major changes in our nation\u2019s policy towards the\nglobal environment. Those were promises to keep, and\ntoday the United States is doing so. Today we are working\nwith other nations to build on the promising work of the\nUnited Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.\nWe are working to make sure that all nations meet their\ncommitments under the global climate Convention. We are\nseeking to complete negotiations on an accord to prevent the\nworld\u2019s deserts from further expanding. And we seek to\nstrengthen the World Health Organization\u2019s efforts to combat\nthe plague of AIDS, which is not only killing millions, but\nalso exhausting the resources of the nations that can least\nafford it.\nAnd let us make a new commitment to the world\u2019s\nchildren. It is tragic enough that one and a half million\nchildren have died as a result of wars over the past decade.\nBut it is far more unforgivable that during that same period\n40 million children have died from diseases completely\npreventable with simple vaccines or medicines. Every day\n- this day, as we meet here - over 30,000 of the world\u2019s\nchildren will die of malnutrition and disease. As the\nDirector of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF),\nJim Grant, has reminded me, \\\"each of [those children] had\na name and a nationality, a family, a personality and a\npotential\\\".\nWe are compelled to do better by the world\u2019s children.\nJust as our own nation has launched new reforms to ensure\nthat every child has adequate health care, we must do more\nto get basic vaccines and other treatments for curable\ndiseases to children all over the world. It\u2019s the best\ninvestment we\u2019ll ever make. We can find new ways to\nensure that every child grows up with clean, drinkable water\n- that most precious commodity of life itself. And the\nUnited Nations can work even harder to ensure that each\nchild has at least a full primary education - and I mean that\nopportunity for girls as well as boys.\nTo ensure a healthier and more abundant world, we\nsimply must slow the world\u2019s explosive growth in\npopulation. We cannot afford to see the human race double\nby the middle of the next century. Our nation has at last\nrenewed its commitment to work with the United Nations to\nexpand the availability of the world\u2019s family planning\neducation and services. We must ensure that there is a place\nat the table for every one of the world\u2019s children. We can\ndo this.\nAt the birth of this Organization, 48 years ago - another\ntime of both victory and danger - a generation of gifted\nleaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the\nworld\u2019s efforts on behalf of security and prosperity. One\nAmerican leader during that period said this: \\\"It is time we\nsteered by the stars rather than by the light of each passing\nship.\\\" His generation picked peace, human dignity and\nfreedom. Those are good stars. They should remain the\nhighest in our firmament.\nNow history has granted to us a moment of even\ngreater opportunity, when old dangers are ebbing and old\nwalls are crumbling. Future generations will judge us, every\none of us, above all by what we make of this magic\nmoment. Let us resolve that we will dream larger, that we\nwill work harder, so that they can conclude that we did not\nmerely turn walls to rubble, but instead laid the foundations\nfor great things to come.\nLet us ensure that the tide of freedom and democracy\nis not pushed back by the fierce winds of ethnic hatred. Let\nus ensure that the world\u2019s most dangerous weapons are\nsafely reduced and denied to dangerous hands. Let us\nensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier,\nsafer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today. I\nbelieve - I know - that together we can extend this moment\nof miracles into an age of great works and new wonders."

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to begin my statement by\ncongratulating Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session\n- the \\\"session of peace\\\". This choice reflects the confidence\nof Member States in his political ability and diplomatic skill\nand their regard for his country. He will have our full\ncooperation and support. We are confident that, with his\nexperience and wisdom, he will lead us to success in our\nwork.\nI should like also to express to Mr. Insanally\u2019s\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, our deep appreciation and\ngratitude for the excellent manner in which he conducted the\nwork of the General Assembly during its forty-seventh\nsession.\nIt also gives me great pleasure to welcome, in the name\nof the State of Qatar, all the States that recently joined this\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 17\ninternational Organization, which, session after session, has\nreaffirmed its universal character. We look forward to the\ncontribution of these States in an Organization that\nrepresents all nations of the world, without exception.\nOn this occasion, I should like to convey to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, my Government\u2019s deep appreciation for his\ncommitment and dedication to the principles of the United\nNations, for the political ability and diplomatic skill that he\nhas demonstrated, since he assumed this high position, in\ndealing with international problems and crises, and for his\nunremitting efforts, his discernment and his farsightedness in\nrevitalizing this world Organization so that it may face up to\nthe challenges posed by a changing world and achieve peace\non earth. This is reflected in part by his praiseworthy report\nentitled \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), which contains\nimportant proposals in the areas of preventive diplomacy,\npeacemaking and peace-keeping.\nThe new phase the world has embarked on after the end\nof the cold war and the emergence of new complexities in\ninternational relations, side by side with the deterioration of\nthe economic situation, especially in developing countries,\nnow face the United Nations with new burdens and\nresponsibilities, which necessitate the restructuring and\nrevitalization of the Organization in order for it to be able to\nmeet successfully the demands of a changing world. As\nsuch restructuring and revitalization should include the\nactivities of the United Nations in the areas of security and\nsocial and economic development, the State of Qatar\nbelieves that it is necessary to consider an increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council in order to make the\nCouncil more representative of the international community,\nsince the number of Member States in the Organization has\nrisen, on the one hand, and the balance of power and\neconomic weight of some States have changed, on the other.\nSuch an increase should include both permanent and\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council, and there\nshould be adequate representation of each of the five\ncontinents. It is necessary, however, that the membership of\nthe Council should remain within the manageable limits that\nmay enable it to maintain its effectiveness in dealing with\nworld crises that are constantly increasing in gravity.\nSince the end of cold war and the disappearance of\nEast-West confrontation, major steps have been taken\ntowards arms limitation at the international level. Nuclear\narsenals have been reduced, nuclear tests have been frozen,\na Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction, has been opened for signature and\nQatar was among the first to sign it. In this respect,\nhowever, I should like to stress a very important point,\nnamely that arms limitation, particularly with respect to\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, should be\ngiven a high priority in the interests of the peace and\nstability of the States of the region so that the funds released\nthereby may be channelled to development and the\nachievement of economic and social progress. This,\nhowever, must apply to all the States of the region without\nexception. Consequently, it is my country\u2019s view that it is\nimportant for all the States of the Middle East, without\nexception, to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. Qatar supports all initiatives aimed at\nmaking the Middle East a region free from all nuclear and\nother weapons of mass destruction and their systems of\ndelivery, especially as we enter upon a new era of peace\nwhich, by its nature, contradicts the very idea of developing\nand stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.\nThe State of Qatar is very much concerned about the\ninternational economic situation, believing that a stable\ninternational economic situation is the cornerstone for the\nbuilding of a new world order that could be characterized by\nstability, security and prosperity. We are particularly\nconcerned about the economic situation of developing\ncountries, most of which are suffering from a heavy burden\nof indebtedness, the service of which exhausts a large\nportion of their limited resources which are hardly sufficient\nto meet the needs of their struggling peoples. We therefore\nbelieve that addressing the problem of indebtedness is the\nfirst essential step towards strengthening the economies of\nthose countries. We know that there are numerous studies\nand propositions on this issue, but what is needed more are\nthe political will and genuine desire on the part of rich\ncreditor States to solve once and for all the problem of\nindebtedness in favour of developing countries, particularly\nthe African least-developed countries. Needless to say,\ncontinuing civil wars in the countries of the third world and\nconflicts among them have taken a heavy toll in the case of\nthose countries and their economies. Among those countries\nare those of the Gulf region which have had their share of\nsuffering because of recent crises and events in the Middle\nEast.\nThe security and stability of the Gulf region are the\nforemost objectives that the State of Qatar seeks to achieve\nby its efforts and contacts. Security and stability, as we all\nknow, are important not only to the States of the region, but\nalso to the entire world because of the region\u2019s strategic\nimportance and its energy resources that the world needs.\nThe State of Qatar believes that this security and stability\ncannot be achieved other than by cooperation between the\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nStates of the region themselves on the basis of good\nneighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in internal\naffairs, respect for sovereignty and independence, respect for\nrecognized international borders and for the agreements\nconcluded among themselves, and the settlement of\ndifferences and of disputes by peaceful means, particularly\nthrough negotiation, mediation and international adjudication.\nFrom this perspective, the State of Qatar supports all\nefforts being made to solve the dispute over the three islands\nof Abu Mousa, Greater Tunb and Smaller Tunb between the\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\nthrough negotiation and by other peaceful means, in the hope\nthat these peaceful efforts will result in settling all\noutstanding issues between the two States. In this\nconnection, we welcome the recent statements by officials of\nboth countries in which they expressed their desire to resolve\nthe dispute by peaceful means through bilateral channels.\nBy the same token, the State of Qatar reiterates its full\nsupport for the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait and its\nterritorial integrity within its international boundaries as\ndemarcated by Security Council resolution 833 (1993) on the\nKuwait-Iraq boundaries. The State of Qatar also reaffirms\nits concern for the preservation of the territorial integrity of\nIraq and calls upon the United Nations and the international\ncommunity to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,\nespecially in basic civilian and humanitarian areas. This\nrequires full compliance by Iraq with all the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, first among which is\nresolution 687 (1991) in all its provisions.\nThe State of Qatar is following with great interest the\nsuccessive and positive developments in the march towards\npeace in the Middle East. These developments in our\nopinion turn a new page in the history of the region. We\nhave welcomed the agreement reached by the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel concerning self-\ngovernment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, as a first step\ntowards a just, complete and lasting solution to the\nPalestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis\nof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973),\nthe principle of land for peace, full Israeli withdrawal from\nall occupied Arab territories including the holy city of Al-\nQuds and the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon as well as\nthe occupied Jordanian territories, and the implementation of\nthe legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding the right of self-determination. This will lay the\nfoundation for security and stability in the Middle East. In\nthis respect, Qatar reiterates its continued support for the\npeace efforts undertaken according to and on the basis of the\nprinciples agreed upon. It looks forward to seeing the\nongoing negotiations make fundamental and parallel progress\non all tracks. Short of this, no real peace, in our view, could\nbe achieved in the region.\nWe also follow with hope and admiration the efforts by\nour sister country, Lebanon, towards political stability,\nsecurity and reconstruction. The State of Qatar will spare no\neffort in supporting Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and sharing in the\nreconstruction of that country in response to the call of\nbrotherhood. In this context, Qatar calls for full and\nunconditional implementation of Security Council resolution\n425 (1978).\nThe State of Qatar, which condemns terrorism in any\nshape or form, values greatly the question of human rights.\nThis stems from Qatar\u2019s belief in the dignity of man and its\nadherence to the eternal principles of Islamic Sharia, which\nuphold the right of the individual to a decent life of freedom,\njustice, peace, brotherhood and the equality of all men.\nGiven this belief, Qatar views human rights as a high moral\nvalue that should not be used as a means of or a pretext for\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States, and an\nissue that should not be addressed by varying standards that\ndiffer from the case of one State to the other. In view of the\nuniversal character of human rights, their basic principles\nshould include the right to self-determination and the\ninherent link between human rights and the right to\ndevelopment. In view of the fact that each society has its\nown customs, traditions, culture and principles which it\ncherishes and adheres to in line with its creed and outlook,\nconsideration should be given to the historical and cultural\nframeworks of the Arab and Islamic world as well as to\nthose of other cultures and civilizations. Here I should like\nto point out with justified pride that Islam, 14 centuries ago,\nupheld the right of the individual to live in peace, freedom\nand dignity. This is the true picture of human rights in\nIslam.\nThe international community, as represented by the\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, has condemned\nthe Serbian aggression in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the unprecedented practice of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" of which the Bosnian Muslim people was the\nvictim. But what use condemnation? Condemnation has\nhad no effect whatsoever, as it has not been backed by\naction: the successive resolutions adopted by the Security\nCouncil have remained ineffective; aggression did not stop;\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" continued, the safe areas have not been\nsafe and even relief assistance did not reach the people in\nthe besieged cities and areas. Yet, the Security Council has\nnot taken the necessary steps to enforce compliance with its\nresolutions as it has done in other cases. Even the arms\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 19\nembargo the Council imposed on the former Yugoslavia was\nnot lifted in the case of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina regardless of the fact that lifting it would\nenable the Bosnians to exercise their legitimate right of\nself-defence; nor were the offers of some Islamic States to\nsend forces to take part in protecting the safe areas accepted.\nNow, if this painful situation does not change and if the\nnecessary measures to enforce these resolutions are not\ntaken, history will record our disgraceful failure to uphold\nthe principles of the Charter and to force aggressors to\nrespect the norms of international legality. Besides, we must\nnot forget that it is important not to allow such grave\nviolations to continue to be committed with impunity. These\nviolations are crimes against humanity and, therefore, the\nState of Qatar fully supports the resolution relating to the\nestablishment of the International Tribunal to prosecute war\ncrimes in the former Yugoslavia.\nThe State of Qatar follows with great interest the\ndevelopments in the Russian Federation. We hope that that\nFederation will overcome its crises so that it may continue\nto perform its important role in resolving global crises in its\ncapacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, a\nco-sponsor of the peace negotiations in the Middle East and\na participant that has taken significant steps in the area of\nlimiting nuclear armaments.\nQatar supports the United Nations operation in our\nsister country, Somalia, and welcomes the determination of\nthe world Organization to continue this operation, which\naims at restoring peace and security in that country and at\nthe reconstruction of its State institutions in spite of all the\ndifficulties. We call upon the Somali leaderships to continue\nthe process of national reconciliation, to support the United\nNations efforts, to play their role in the process of political\nreconstruction and to refrain from doing anything that would\nobstruct that process.\nThe State of Qatar follows with interest the historic\npositive developments taking place in the Republic of South\nAfrica, and welcomes the progress that has been made\ntowards the final dismantling of the hideous system of\napartheid and the establishment of a democratic system for\nthe first time in the history of that country. While\nwelcoming these important developments in the political\narena in this Republic, Qatar supports the call by Mr. Nelson\nMandela, president of the African National Congress, for\nlifting the economic sanctions imposed on his country and\nfrom which its people have been suffering for years. This,\nin our opinion, would promote the democratic process and\nconsolidate economic development in that country.\nStability of the situation in South-East Asia was among\nthe positive results we have witnessed in the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts. This was achieved by resolving the\nconflict in Cambodia, drafting the new constitution and\nrestoring the monarchy. This peace was achieved after long\nyears of persistent struggle under the leadership of Norodom\nSihanouk for establishing peace and security in the country\nand restoring its territorial integrity and its sovereignty over\nits whole territory. In this connection, we commend the\ncontinuous efforts made by the United Nations and its\nSecretary-General, efforts that paved the way for elections\nand led to success of the peace process in Cambodia.\nThe last decade has witnessed increasing interest in\nenvironmental issues at both the official and popular levels.\nIndeed, the environment has become a high priority on the\nagendas of States and an integral part of their national\ninterests and security. This is a positive and necessary\ndevelopment. It is, however, most important in this respect\nto identify precisely the sources of pollution and the\nrelationship between the environment and economic\ndevelopment. The imposition of an energy tax at the present\ntime would limit the possibilities of development in the State\nof Qatar and other oil-exporting States. It would affect\nadversely their ability to meet their obligations and limit\ntheir ability to finance the exploration and production\noperations that would enable them as producers to satisfy the\nincreasing demand on oil. In an independent world, such\nnegative effects will not be limited to the oil-exporting\ncountries but will extend to other countries and to other\neconomic sectors all over the world. It is obvious that the\nidea of an energy tax on exporting countries is unfair both\nin its proposed rates on the sources of environmental\npollution and in comparison with other sources of pollution,\nsuch as coal. The negative environmental effects of the use\nof coal far exceed those of the use of oil. Notwithstanding\nsuch facts, however, we find that the tax rates have been\nproposed in the reverse ratio to the effects of the pollutants.\nOn the other hand, the proposed tax does not take into\nconsideration the amount of pollution caused by every\nindividual State. A single major industrial country may very\nwell pollute the environment to a far greater extent than any\nnumber of oil-producing countries put together. Regardless\nof this, however, the tax targets the latter in a manner that\nsuggests objectives other than the preservation of the\nenvironment.\nIt is no exaggeration to state that the world we all live\nin faces numerous challenges. The economic, social and\npolitical problems which face many countries in today\u2019s\nworld have become so enormous and so complex that they\nmay well seem intractable. However, if we let ourselves be\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nguided by the spirit of the Charter and the principles of our\nworld Organization, and if we stand as one behind the\nUnited Nations, we are bound to find proper solutions to\nthose problems, which have become a common denominator\nto all the States of the world. There is no other way but to\nwork harder in the context of world solidarity and\ninternational cooperation towards the building of a world\nwherein the lights of peace, security, stability and well-being\nwould shine brightly.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with\nimmense pride that I congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Trinidad and Tobago, on your\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Your election to this\nimportant position is a tribute to the active and constructive\nrole played by Guyana in international affairs over the years.\nIt is also a tribute to your own personal integrity and\ndiplomatic acumen. As a fellow representative of a member\nState of the Caribbean Community, I am confident that you\nwill bring to the deliberations ahead the necessary measure\nof impartiality and astuteness that will be indispensable in\nreconciling the differing views on the many complex issues\nbefore us.\nMy delegation joins in welcoming the six newest\nMembers admitted into this family of nations in 1993:\nAndorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak\nRepublic and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\nThese new Members, all of which are relatively small, can\ndraw some inspiration from the election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly of a representative from Guyana, the\nsmallest developing country in terms of population, ever to\nassume that position. For indeed, small States must continue\nto be afforded every opportunity to be full and active\ncontributors to the collective search for peace, security and\neconomic and social advancement for all.\nAll States, particularly the more vulnerable among us,\ncan derive much hope and encouragement from the\ndevelopments of September 1993, which set the course for\na new relationship between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and improved prospects for peace in\nthe Middle East. The historic exchange of letters of\nrecognition between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and\nChairman Yasser Arafat, and the subsequent signing of the\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement, which extends limited interim\nself-government to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and in\nJericho in the West Bank, constitute a momentous\ndevelopment in the turbulent and violent history of the\nregion.\nWho among us could have anticipated that, in the midst\nof current growing tensions and conflicts worldwide, such\nsworn enemies in the perennial theatre of conflict in the\nMiddle East would have conceded so much in the pursuit of\na better future? In today\u2019s troubled times, these bold\npartners in peace have renewed the faith of many the world\nover in the capacity of diplomacy, political will and\nenlightened self-interest to overcome decades of hatred,\nmistrust and fear. We all recognize the tremendous\ndifficulties and challenges ahead. Trinidad and Tobago\nwishes these leaders well and urges active United Nations\ninvolvement in assisting all parties concerned in a smooth\ntransition from a state of belligerence to one of cooperation\nand peaceful co-existence. Given the centrality of the\nPalestinian question to the conflict in the Middle East, all\nparties need to work indefatigably to translate this initial\nsuccess into a comprehensive and durable peace for the\nregion.\nA similar concerted response on the part of the United\nNations and the international community will be imperative\nin assisting the people of South Africa in their transition to\na united, democratic, non-racial South Africa. After more than 45 years of anguished attention to the despair, suffering\nand injustice in that country, the provision of token measures\nof assistance would be unacceptable.\nIf the world is to give any credence to the United\nNations new thrust towards post-conflict peace-building, a\ntangible commitment to the success of the transition in South\nAfrica needs to be made. We therefore join the call for an\nenhanced United Nations presence in South Africa, a\npresence that is urgently needed prior to the elections of\nApril 1994. Trinidad and Tobago is taking the necessary\nsteps to implement the decision taken on 8 October by the\nAssembly to lift economic sanctions against South Africa\n(resolution 48/1). It is our hope that the international\ncommunity will respond positively and generously to this\nhistoric decision; and that it will quickly lead to the\nprovision of ample financial and technical assistance, as well\nas to appropriate investments, that will allow a new\nnon-racial Government to begin redressing the grave\ninequalities in all aspects of life in South Africa. We also\nhope that, in time, the advancement of greater economic and\nsocial equity in South Africa will mitigate, and eventually\nresolve, other problems that are the legacy of apartheid,\nincluding the rampant and widespread violence which\nthreatens the process of transformation in the country.\nOver the years the Government and people of Trinidad\nand Tobago have faithfully monitored the progress of the\nSouth African people on their arduous journey to this critical\npoint in their history. We have adhered assiduously to the\nvarious sanctions and other restrictive measures adopted\nagainst South Africa by the United Nations. Within our\nlimited means we have also extended a helping hand to the\nvictims of apartheid. Trinidad and Tobago has shared in the\nanguish of South Africans in their long struggle against the\nracist system of apartheid. We will also rejoice with them\nin their victory as we anxiously await the dawn of a free,\njust, non-racial and prosperous society in South Africa.\nHere at the United Nations let us seek to emulate the\ncourage and statesmanship recently demonstrated by the\nmajor political actors in the Middle East and South Africa.\nWe too must seize the opportunities for peace and seek to\nemploy fully the machinery at our disposal in the active\npursuit of a better future. Amid the growing anxieties and\ninsecurities pervading many societies, member States have\na collective responsibility to the millions around the globe\nwho continue to repose much faith and hope in this\nOrganization and its ability to address successfully the\nmyriad political, economic, environmental and social\nproblems now confronting us all. Trinidad and Tobago\ntherefore joins in celebrating a reinvigorated United Nations,\nwhich is seeking to have a more meaningful impact on the\nlives of the world\u2019s peoples.\nTrinidad and Tobago applauds the heightened\ninvolvement of the United Nations in the effort to restore\ndemocracy to Haiti and to secure the safe return of President\nJean-Bertrand Aristide to the helm of a legitimate\nconstitutional government. The United Nations, with its\nactive involvement in the organization of the 1990 elections\nin Haiti, facilitated the free expression by the Haitian people\nof their unfulfilled dreams and yearnings for freedom and a\ndecent standard of life. It is therefore only fitting that this\nOrganization, with the consent of the legitimate government\nof Haiti, should provide maximum support to efforts to\nguarantee a peaceful return to democracy and national\nreconciliation in that country, without which those dreams\nwould not be realized.\nTrinidad and Tobago is concerned at the serious\ndeterioration in the situation in Haiti since the welcome\nsigning in July of this year of the Governors Island\nAgreement and the New York Pact. We deplore the flagrant\nviolations of human rights and the blood-letting, which must\nbe stopped. We express the hope that international efforts\nto establish a new police force in Haiti and to\nprofessionalize its armed forces will lead to greater\nguarantees of life and liberty in Haiti. My delegation takes\nthis opportunity to commend the Special Envoy for Haiti,\nMr. Dante Caputo, as well as the able staff of the\ninternational Civilian Mission in Haiti for their invaluable\ncontribution towards resolving the crisis.\nDevelopments in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in\nSomalia are among the more worrisome of those in which\nthe United Nations has been involved, particularly in view\nof the Organization\u2019s inability to stem the tide of violence\nand suffering. United Nations interventions in these areas\nare also increasingly being regarded as test cases for the new\nUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the horror and savagery of\nthe persistent attacks on innocent civilians, particularly on\nthe Muslim population, have elicited entirely inadequate\nresponses from the international community.\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the United Nations Protection\nForce and the various international and non-governmental\nhumanitarian organizations, thousands continue to starve, are\nexpelled from their homes and regions, or perish at the\nhands of perpetrators of genocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\".\nYet, despite threats of punishment on the part of the Security\nCouncil, these and other atrocities are committed with\nimpunity, while violent attempts to dismember the sovereign\nState of Bosnia and Herzegovina persist. The United\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3\nNations can ill afford to fail Bosnia and Herzegovina, for\nthat failure will have serious repercussions in the region and\nbeyond, as well as repercussions for the Organization.\nWe have also witnessed alarming developments in\nSomalia. In the early stages of United Nations involvement\nin the country it was faced with a unique combination of\nfactors, including massive starvation and famine, widespread\nviolence, the ready availability among the populace of\nweaponry of varying sophistication, and a total absence of\nany centralized authority. Today, with the assistance of the\nUnited Nations and other organizations, Somalis of good will\ncan be proud of the successes achieved in breaking the\nbackbone of the devastating famine and in making\nsignificant, though limited, strides towards the restoration of\ncivil government and political reconciliation.\nIt is impossible, however, to be oblivious to the major\nmilitary engagements in the Somali capital of Mogadishu,\nwhich have led to tragic loss of life and have seriously\nimperilled the United Nations operation in that limited area.\nTrinidad and Tobago deplores the vicious attacks on the\npeace-keeping forces of the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia (UNOSOM II), which could ultimately derail efforts\nto restore peace and security to the country and frustrate the\nattainment by the Somali people of their goals and\naspirations.\nWe also support the call for urgent steps to be taken to\nensure the safety and security of the tens of thousands of\nmen and women who are engaged in these difficult and\ndangerous United Nations peace-keeping operations around\nthe world.\nThe extent of human suffering and instability now being\nexperienced as a consequence of general economic\nstagnation is as disconcerting and disheartening as that\nvisited upon us by war and strife. Many communities are in\nthe midst of economic and social crisis. Poverty,\nunemployment and crime are increasingly threatening the\nvery fabric of societies and are clamouring for the concerted\nattention of the international community. The United\nNations must heed this call since, as stated by the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali:\n\\\"social peace is as important as strategic or political\npeace\\\". (A/47//277, para. 59)\nThis issue is of utmost importance to Trinidad and\nTobago, which has not been spared the ravaging effects of\na decline in economic activity. The price of the single\nproduct which represents the mainstay of our economy, and\nwhich accounts for more than 40 per cent of government\nrevenue and over 80 per cent of foreign exchange earnings,\nhas been in steady decline. This reality, and the structural\nadjustment policies which have had to be implemented in\nsupport of long-term development, have resulted in serious\ndislocations in the short term. The ranks of the unemployed\nhave grown to approximately 20 per cent and there is an\nincreasing need to provide safety nets for the more\nvulnerable in this society at a time when government\nrevenue continues to fall.\nFurther, Trinidad and Tobago\u2019s very capacity to provide\nsufficient social services to those not in a position to make\nthe burdensome sacrifices required of the general population\nhas also been severely hampered by onerous debt-servicing\npayments. These challenges which we are experiencing in\nTrinidad and Tobago are widely shared by other developing\ncountries.\nThe same spirit of cooperation and activism which now\ncharacterizes the United Nations approach to political and\nsecurity questions must also impel the international\ncommunity to address economic and social questions with an\nequal sense of urgency. The United Nations agenda for\ndevelopment, which the Secretary-General has been\nmandated to prepare, must be given priority attention in the\nyear ahead. In this context, and with the aim of forging a\nnew partnership in the quest for solutions to global economic\nproblems, it may be opportune to consider the convening of\na world economic summit.\nTrinidad and Tobago is of the view that the United\nNations agenda for development should not be restricted to\nproviding guidelines for future action by the United Nations\nin the economic and social sectors. It should also include\nrecommendations for strengthening the capacity of this\nOrganization to enhance international cooperation in these\nfields and to promote the advancement of developing\ncountries.\nAt its forty-seventh session the General Assembly\nreaffirmed that development is a shared responsibility. If\nour collective war on poverty, disease, unemployment and\nother challenges to development is to succeed, it must also\nbe undertaken on the basis of a true partnership, a\npartnership involving individuals, States, regional and\ninternational organizations and non-governmental entities, for\nwe must engender a sense of inclusion among all of\nsociety\u2019s economic and social actors, while giving due\nrecognition to their respective roles and responsibilities.\nHowever, Trinidad and Tobago also shares the\nperspective of the Secretary-General, as stated in his 1993\nreport on the work of the Organization, that\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n\\\"States and their sovereignty are increasingly\nrecognized as indispensable building-blocks of\ninternational order and problem-solving.\\\" (A/48/1, para.\n13)\nWhile all credible entities should be allowed to contribute to\ntheir greatest potential towards our shared objectives, States\nmust not be deprived of the proper tools of governance and\nthe opportunity to utilize them effectively on the basis of\nconsidered national strategies and priorities.\nThe concept of partnership must apply equally to the\narea of development finance and to trade. As regards the\nlatter, Trinidad and Tobago has steered the steady course of\ntrade liberalization but, like many other developing nations,\nhas encountered persistent restrictions in the markets of the\nindustrialized countries. It is hoped that the formation of\nmega-trading blocs will not compound these difficulties\nfurther.\nWe witnessed the application of the principle of global\npartnership in the convening of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development and the\nadoption of Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. To\ndate the first important steps have been taken towards the\nimplementation of the comprehensive programme of\nactivities for sustainable development contained in Agenda\n21. The 1994 Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island States presents the next\nimportant opportunity for the international community to\ndemonstrate the continued political will to fulfil the\ncommitments undertaken at the Earth Summit in 1992.\nFor small island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, this\nGlobal Conference, to be held in Barbados in April of next\nyear, is critical to our efforts to forge, with the assistance of\nthe international community, appropriate strategies for the\nimplementation of Agenda 21, as it pertains to our specific\nsituation. We strongly believe that small States should not\nbe penalized for their limited capacity to inflict major\ndamage on the global environment. Positive recognition\nshould instead be given to their greater propensity for\nattracting a disproportionate share of environmental damage.\nTrinidad and Tobago hopes that adequate concessional funds\nwill be provided for the sustainable-development activities of\nthe small island developing States, as an important\ncomplement to initiatives taken at the national and regional\nlevels.\nThe urgency that developing countries, such as my\nown, attach to the elaboration of the proposed agenda for\ndevelopment signals the importance we attach to achieving\na proper balance in the level of resources devoted to political\nand security questions and those allocated to economic and\nsocial programmes. The World Conference on Population\nand Development in 1994, the Fourth World Conference on\nWomen in 1995 and the preparations for these Conferences,\nwill also contribute significantly to a strengthened economic\nand social agenda within the United Nations.\nIn addition, it is our hope that substantive preparations\nfor the 1995 World Summit for Social Development will\nreinforce the importance of focusing on the ultimate\nobjective of our development policies and programmes: the\nwell-being and advancement of people.\nTrinidad and Tobago intends to follow closely the\nhigh-level plenary discussions to be held on international\ncooperation in the fight against drug abuse and illicit drug-\ntrafficking. Our country has fallen victim to the increased\ntransit of illegal drugs through its territory. As is often the\ncase, increased levels of illicit trafficking have led to\nwidespread drug abuse and an accompanying rise in other\ncrimes. We note that this problem continues to plague a\ngrowing number of nations and therefore urge that higher\npriority be given to the United Nations programmes designed\nto combat this menace.\nThe United Nations has not been provided with the\nfinancial resources needed to implement its legislative\nmandates. We have now exhausted some of the funds from\nwhich relief was frequently obtained in past years, resulting\nin a serious threat to the daily operations of the\nOrganization. However, while it will be readily agreed that\nany organization must be provided with the resources it\nneeds to carry out its functions, it must also be admitted that\nthere is a growing imbalance between the demands being\nmade upon the United Nations and the ability of a growing\nnumber of States to meet the cost of these demands. This\nis particularly the case with the peace-keeping budget, which\nin 1993 is expected to be almost three times the amount of\nthe regular budget.\nThe United Nations is now in a critical period of\nadjustment and reorientation. Trinidad and Tobago concurs\nwith the view that there must be improvements in the\nadministrative and operational performance of the United\nNations in all its activities. Transparency and accountability\nmust be the watchwords of the Organization.\nAs we approach our fiftieth anniversary, we the States\nMembers of the United Nations must remain steadfast in our\nsupport for the fundamental purposes and principles which\nhave promoted order and security in the world community.\nWe must also meet the challenges and grasp the\nopportunities presented by the altered global environment.\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5\nLet us forge ahead, confident in our ability to work together\nand to succeed in advancing the cause of peace and\ndevelopment.\n"

        "file_text": "Botswana and Guyana\nhave, since their attainment of independence, both in 1966,\nbeen the closest of friends. That is why we have welcomed\nthe election of Ambassador Insanally of Guyana to the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session with so much warmth\nand anticipation. I say \\\"anticipation\\\" because we are\nconfident that he has the requisite experience, expertise and\ndiplomatic finesse to make a good and productive President\nfor this most hopeful session of the Organization.\nOur gratitude goes to the outgoing President of the\nforty-seventh session, the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, who\ngave the best account of his skills in the service of the\nAssembly last year.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe new Members who have just joined the United\nNations are most welcome in our midst. We assure them of\nour fellowship and readiness to cooperate with them in the\nservice of peace here at the United Nations.\nWe also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the creative dynamism he has\ninjected into the work of the United Nations. We know his\nwork has not been easy. But under his able leadership the\nUnited Nations has indeed demonstrated its capacity to serve\nas a reliable instrument of impartial management of\ninternational conflicts. Increasingly, we are seeing the\nfulfilment of the ideas contained in what I think was the\nmost forward-looking report ever produced by a Secretary-\nGeneral of this Organization, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nMr. Ansari (India), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nWe commend the efforts the Secretary-General has\nundertaken so far to enhance the Organization\u2019s\neffectiveness. Botswana understands the concerns raised by\nthe Secretary-General when he addressed the Fifth\nCommittee in August. Many demands and problems foisted\non the United Nations have put a lot of strain on its coffers.\nResources made available by Member States are far from\nenough to meet these demands. Thus, the Organization is\nfacing a financial crisis of unprecedented magnitude. The\nbiggest problem, as explained by the Secretary-General, is\nthe failure of some Member States to fulfil their financial\nobligations by paying the assessed contribution for both the\nregular budget and peace-keeping missions. Member States\nmust heed the Secretary-General\u2019s call and fulfil their\nCharter obligations by paying their contributions in full and\non time.\nAt the same time, it would be remiss of me not to\nemphasize the need and importance of transparency and\naccountability in the use of United Nations funds. Of late,\nwe have heard of many irregularities in the administration of\nthis Organization\u2019s funds, in particular funds for peace-\nkeeping missions. A number of proposals have been put\nforward by the various Member States for a review of the\nrules and regulations governing United Nations finances.\nThe time has come to set up a respectable mechanism to\nundertake this urgent task.\nAlthough the cold war is no more and old ideological\nempires have unravelled, the euphoria of triumphalism has\nbeen short-lived. There is turmoil almost everywhere as\nage-old nationalisms that have for so long been suppressed\nexplode with a vengeance that knows no limit. True to\ncharacter, the twentieth century will not, so it seems, fade\naway peacefully.\nThe post-cold-war era and the celebrated onset of a new\nworld order have thus not brought peace to our world, but\nmore bloodshed, instability and insecurity in many places.\nConsequently, there has been a rapid expansion of United\nNations peace-keeping operations - far beyond the capacity\nof the Organization\u2019s resources to manage. There is neither\nthe manpower nor the financial wherewithal for the United\nNations to be everywhere in the magnitude of presence that\nis so often requested.\nThere is, nevertheless, every reason for us to be\nsatisfied with the valiant efforts which the Secretary-General\nand his staff have exerted to ensure that the many fires of\ncivil war that have become such dominant features of the\nso-called new world order do not engulf us all. The United\nNations has shown that, given the wherewithal, it can live up\nto what we expect of it in the realm of peacemaking and\npeace-keeping. Cambodia has just been saved from\nself-destruction. Imagine what Somalia could have become\nhad the United States and the United Nations not intervened\nto safeguard the delivery of the massive humanitarian\nassistance which the international community has poured into\nthe famished country. Even in the Balkans, where the most\nbrutal and senseless civil war imaginable is in progress,\nparticularly in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a\ncivil war that for a year and a half has been defying every\nsolution attempted - the United Nations has played a\nmitigating humanitarian role under the most difficult of\noperational circumstances.\nOn Somalia, Botswana stands firm in its support for the\nUnited Nations mission of mercy in that devastated country.\nWe condemn in the strongest terms the continued attack on\nUnited Nations peace-keeping forces even as we deeply\nregret the loss of innocent Somali lives. We cannot condone\nthe massive loss of civilian lives in Mogadishu, though at\nthe same time we need to be extremely circumspect in\napportioning blame to one side of the conflict or the other.\nAn international effort to save a people is in serious\njeopardy. An attack on United Nations peace-keeping forces\nmust never be taken lightly, for it is fraught with very\nserious implications. The horrendous spectacle of the corpse\nof a United Nations peace-keeper being dragged like a\ngarbage bag on the streets of Mogadishu deserves all the\nopprobrium civilized humanity can heap on such a callous\nact of inhumanity. The international community must not\nflinch in the face of the acts of those in Mogadishu who are\nbent on thwarting the process of reconstruction and\nrehabilitation in Somalia.\nIn many ways, the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) has been a success. Botswana is proud to have\nmade a contribution to UNOSOM, however modest.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 15\nThe terrible civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a\nmonumental outrage that must shame us all as human\nbeings. A world that is able to tolerate scenes of tiny\ninnocent children being torn to pieces or maimed by\nshrapnel and bullets - innocent and helpless victims of a war\nthat makes sense only to its perpetrators - is a world without\na conscience. The international community must devise\nmore creative ways and means of dealing effectively with\nthat savage conflict.\nTo turn to our own continent, in Mozambique there is\nan encouraging movement towards peace and tranquility.\nThe situation there has stabilized enough to give us more\nhope than ever before that the war-ravaged sister country\nwill soon enjoy the beginnings of economic recovery and\nnational reconciliation and healing. Humanitarian relief is\nnow able to reach the famine-stricken. The United Nations\npeace-keeping force, among which is our own contingent, is\nprogressively moving towards full deployment and the\naccomplishment of its mandate. It is hoped that the many\ncease-fire violations thus far recorded will not sabotage the\npeace process.\nThe survival of the State and nation of Angola is in\nvery serious jeopardy as the senseless civil war that has been\nraging there since the mid-1970s has worsened and assumed\nthe dimensions of an unstoppable conflagration. All the\nefforts of the Security Council to find a lasting solution to\nthe civil war have come to naught as a result of Mr.\nSavimbi\u2019s stubborn refusal to negotiate a peaceful end to the\nconflict. Unfortunately, in the face of this stubbornness on\nthe part of Mr. Savimbi, the world seems utterly incapable\nof doing anything more than calling continuously for\npeaceful negotiations - a call that is continuously scorned.\nThe international community must do more to save\nAngola. A terrible crime against humanity is being\nperpetrated against the Angolan people. We take note of the\nrecent announcement by UNITA that it is ready to accept the\nBicesse Accords and the results of the 1992 elections. The\nGovernment has in principle agreed to the resumption of\npeace talks. We hope that this time the peace talks, if they\ntake place, will produce the solution we have been\ndesperately waiting for.\nIn South Africa, the horizon of change is more\npromising than ever before. Negotiations for a new South\nAfrica have been torturously slow and painful, but they\nhave, in a stunning reversal of fortune, produced the first\ntangible evidence of the onset of real and meaningful\nchange. The legislative structures that are to underpin the\ntransition to the establishment of a democratic Government\nin the first half of next year are in place. Four bills -\nnamely, those regarding the Independent Election\nCommission, the Independent Media Commission, the\nIndependent Broadcasting Authority and the Transitional\nExecutive Council - have been adopted by the Negotiating\nCouncil and will soon be enacted into law, having been\npassed by the South African Parliament.\nOnce the transitional legislative package has been\ncompleted with the adoption of the interim constitution and\nthe constitutional principles and fundamental rights at present\nunder negotiation, the transition will officially begin with the\ninstallation of the Transitional Executive Council. To show\nthe great promise that the situation in South Africa holds\ntoday, I can do no better than quote Mr. Nelson Mandela\u2019s\nmomentous speech of 24 September to the United Nations\nSpecial Committee against Apartheid. He said,\n\\\"The countdown to democracy has begun. The\ndate for the demise of the white minority regime has\nbeen determined, agreed and set\\\".\nIn its statement of 29 September 1993 the Ad Hoc\nCommittee of the Organization of African Unity on Southern\nAfrica concurred that enough progress had been made in the\npeace process in South Africa to warrant the lifting of\neconomic sanctions. This was a momentous decision taken\nby Africa in the ardent belief and hope that we are truly\napproaching a historic watershed in the blood-stained history\nof southern Africa: the end at last of the long nightmare of\napartheid. However, as Mr. Mandela and the Secretary\nGeneral of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, Mr.\nBenny Alexander, have conceded, freedom is not yet there.\nWith all the horrific violence now ravaging the KwaZulu\ncountryside and the East Rand townships, in the back yard\nof the World Trade Centre in Johannesburg, where the\nnegotiations are taking place, the process does not lack\nenemies or detractors. There is also the unfortunate boycott\nof the negotiation process by some parties, whose\nimplications it is impossible to ascertain. Nevertheless, the\npeople of South Africa, more than ever before, will need\nand, indeed, deserve our determined companionship as they\nwalk the last and, possibly, the most difficult mile in their\njourney to the new South Africa.\nRegrettably, progress, if any, has been very slow in the\nimplementation of the United Nations plan on Western\nSahara. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to spare\nno effort to ensure that the referendum is held so that the\npeople of Western Sahara can at long last decide their future.\nBotswana is encouraged by the readiness of all parties\nto the Liberian conflict to honour their commitments to the\nYamoussoukro Accords and other subsequent peace plans.\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe are anxious to see the Accords implemented peacefully\nand in full. The Secretary- General, in his last report on the\nsubject (S/26422), notes that a successful implementation of\nthe Accords would require sufficient resources. We appeal\nto all Member States to be generous in their contributions to\nthe trust fund set up for this purpose.\nIt is with a sigh of relief that we welcome the adoption\nof Security Council resolution 872 (1993) on Rwanda. We\nappeal to all the parties to the conflict in Rwanda to\ncooperate fully with the United Nations Assistance Mission\nfor Rwanda (UNAMIR) in ensuring that that war-torn East\nAfrican sister country does not revert to the carnage that has\noften threatened its very existence.\nWe celebrate the triumph of the democratic process in\nthe south-eastern Asian nation of Cambodia. The shroud of\nmisery and death that for many years eclipsed Cambodia\nhas, hopefully, now been lifted, and lifted forever. We\ncongratulate the United Nations and the Cambodians on a\njob well done. 89.56 per cent of Cambodian voters,\nundaunted by violence and threats of violence, have spoken\nloud and clear that they want peace and reconciliation.\nIn the Middle East, the homeland of the Bible and its\nmiracles, we have recently witnessed a miraculous\nrapprochement between the Jewish people of Israel and the\nPalestinian people. The foundations of peace in the area\nhave been laid, and no effort should be spared to build on\nthem. No effort should be spared in making the peace\nprocess only just begun a just, comprehensive and lasting\none. Given the desperate conditions in the occupied\nterritories, we, the international community, have a duty to\nsupport and nurture the peace process by contributing\ngenerously to the economic reconstruction of the area to\nenable the Palestinians to taste the fruits of peace.\nWe cherish the hope that the sudden improvement of\nprospects for peace in the Middle East will have a catalytic\nand propelling effect on the quest for a workable formula for\nthe reunification of the island Republic of Cyprus. So long\nas the island remains divided, it will remain a source of\nconflict and instability in the area.\nSo it is with Korea. Botswana hopes the divided\npeninsula will soon realize that it has become fashionable in\nthis post-cold-war era for age-old problems suddenly to\nbecome amenable to solution. Change - peaceful change -\nthrough negotiation is the imperative of our time.\nIn Central America, after many years of conflict, El\nSalvador is finally at peace. We hope that the proven\ncapacity and efficacy of the United Nations in the field of\nelection-monitoring and supervision will again be put to\ngood use in El Salvador\u2019s March 1994 election.\nIn Haiti, we look forward to the imminent restoration\nof the presidency of Father Aristide. The success of the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States in\nshaping the agreement deserves our commendation.\nBotswana, a country whose respect for human rights is\nsecond to none, supports fully the creation of a post of\ncommissioner of human rights. We have no human rights\nabuses to hide, nor do we fear criticism - constructive\ncriticism, that is - should the international community find\nsome aspect of our domestic policy or policies to be\nincompatible with the enjoyment of human rights by our\ncitizens. This is not an invitation to interference in our\ninternal affairs. We have always maintained that no nation\nhas the right to violate the basic human rights of its citizens\nwhile using Article 2 (7) of the Charter as an argument\nagainst intervention by the international community.\nRecent reports have revealed that the United Nations is\nspending roughly three times as much on peace-keeping and\npeacemaking as on development assistance. Problems of\ndevelopment, as should be clear to everybody, constitute the\nunderlying cause of world conflicts, and for the United\nNations to be effective in the maintenance of international\npeace, more energy and resources have to be expended on\ndevelopment activities.\nOf particular concern are the downward trend in\nAfrica\u2019s commodity prices, the debt burden and the\nshrinking aid flow. In addition, many African countries,\nincluding my own, have had to cope with the serious effects\nof drought and famine. The civil strife which many African\ncountries have had to cope with have also had a crippling\neffect on economic activity through damage to infrastructure.\nIn order for an effective process of development to get\nunder way in Africa the international community needs to\nestablish a more open trading system giving access to, and\nadequate compensation for, commodities produced in Africa.\nFor the past several years the market share for African goods\nhas experienced a dramatic decline. Botswana appeals for\na speedy conclusion of the current Uruguay Round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations, which we believe will\nstrengthen Africa\u2019s trading capacity and allow unrestricted\naccess of our commodities to the world markets.\nThe debt burden continues to be a major obstacle to\nAfrican economic growth and development. Clearly,\nnecessary measures have not been taken to attend to this\ncompounding problem. The time has come for the donor\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 17\ncommunity and the multilateral financial institutions to heed\nAfrica\u2019s call to reduce or totally cancel the debt stock.\nWe live in exciting times, exciting in both positive and\nnegative ways. We have been fortunate to wake up from the\nlong nightmare of the cold war and bear witness to the birth\nof a new world, however imperfect. The birth of any new\nepoch has never been easy or free of pain. The membership\nof the Organization has multiplied with the rapid emergence\nof new nations, whose aspirations for self-determination had\nfor so long been frustrated.\nThe import of this most welcome development is, of\ncourse, not simply that we are close to universality but, also,\nthat the problems facing the Organization have multiplied.\nThankfully, our rejuvenated United Nations seems to have\nborne this increased load of responsibilities with a great deal\nof enthusiasm. Botswana renews its faith in this rejuvenated\nUnited Nations and in its time-tested Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "For the Haitian delegation, the assumption of the presidency\nof the General Assembly by, for the first time ever, a\nrepresentative of the Caribbean is a source of pride and\nsatisfaction. I should like to convey to you, Mr. President,\nthe warm congratulations of the President, the Government\nand the people of the Republic of Haiti on your unanimous\nelection and their best wishes for success in your\nendeavours. Your selection is undoubtedly a manifestation\nof the well-founded acknowledgement of your eminent\npersonal qualities and rich diplomatic experience, and also\nattests to the growing role of your country, the Republic of\nGuyana, in international relations.\nI wish also to congratulate your predecessor, Mr.\nStoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who successfully directed the\nAssembly\u2019s work at its forty-seventh session.\nThis is also an opportunity for me to express our\nprofound appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his remarkable efforts in the cause of\npeace and for the new dynamics that he has stamped on the\nOrganization.\nAs the century draws to a close, history is being made\nat a remarkable pace. Every day there are important events\nthat put international life on a new course because of the\nprofound impact they have on the destiny of peoples. It\nseems to us that, at the dawn of the third millennium, the\nworld is seeking new direction. Respect for the person, the\nneed for democracy and fundamental freedoms and the\nclimate of peace to which peoples throughout the world\naspire: these concepts are taking concrete form in major\nevents that attract our attention today. In the search for a\nnew dimension to give to peace, leaders in various parts of\nthe world have begun a dialogue that, in the past, was\nthought impossible.\nThis is the case in the Middle East, where, after\ndecades of hostility, Israelis and Palestinians have embarked\non the path to a historic rapprochement, which we hope will\nbe of benefit to the two peoples and the entire region.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9\nLikewise, recent developments in South Africa -\nnotably the establishment of the Transitional Executive\nCouncil and the announcement that free elections are to be\nheld on 27 April 1994 on the basis of universal suffrage -\nsignal the long-awaited building of a multi-racial, democratic\nand united society.\nFollowing two decades of civil war, Cambodia is at last\nexperiencing a period of peace. This has made possible the\nholding of democratic general elections and the\nestablishment of a legitimate Government.\nAfter 12 years of armed conflict, El Salvador, with the\nsigning of the Mexico Agreements, is moving towards the\nconsolidation of peace.\nWe must note that, in all continents, considerable\nprogress is being made in the search for peace, although the\nexistence of hotbeds of tension of all types - fuelled by,\namong other factors, racial, ethnic, tribal or clan\ndifferences - indicates that dialogue, which alone can ensure\nharmonious human coexistence, is not always achieved\nspontaneously.\nThe United Nations has played a decisive role in the\nmediation aimed at securing a negotiated settlement of these\ncrises. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s sustained efforts\nto contribute to the process of bringing peace to these\npeoples, whose pain, privation and distress resonate deeply\nin the hearts of the Haitian people. There is no doubt that\nthe concepts of preventive diplomacy, maintenance of peace,\nrestoration of peace and peace building that are developed in\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" are guiding\nprinciples for this Organization in its action to guarantee\ninternational peace and security.\nBut, in order to meet the diverse challenges confronting\nit and to respond to the expectations placed in it, the United\nNations must adapt to a new reality and must have adequate\nmeans to do so. In this context, the Haitian delegation\nsupports the process of reform and restructuring aimed at\nincreasing the Organization\u2019s effectiveness. We believe that\nUnited Nations activities in the field of economic and social\ndevelopment should be given at least as much attention as\nthat accorded to peace-keeping operations.\nUnquestionably, the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" provides the\nOrganization with a point of reference, which enables us to\napproach the problems of peace in a global environment that\nis in a state of change and compels us to reflect on the\nquestion of what constitutes the very foundations of peace.\nSome say that peace is indissociably related to democracy\nand development. We share this view. Without peace, there\ncan be no development, and, without development and\nrespect for human rights, one cannot expect social peace.\nMy Government, which was established as a result of\nthe Governors Island Agreements, believes that the\nfundamental principles proclaimed in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and in the Haitian Constitution\nshould be constantly in our minds, motivating us to provide\nall the better for the well-being of our people.\nFor two years the Haitian people has been waging an\nearnest and constant struggle for the restoration of\ndemocracy in Haiti and of the fundamental rights that were\nstolen from it in the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 30 September 1991.\nToday, thanks to the constant support of the international\ncommunity, we are on the eve of turning this painful page\nin the history of our country. In this respect, we should like\nto express warm thanks to the Special Envoy of the United\nNations Secretary-General and the Organization of American\nStates for his inestimable achievement. We hope that we\nshall be able to continue to cooperate with him towards\nsecuring a definitive settlement of the Haitian crisis.\nAs members know, the Governors Island Agreement\nwas signed on 3 July 1993. That instrument sets the\nmodalities for the restoration of constitutional order and\ndemocracy in Haiti.\nOn 30 August a Prime Minister, chosen in accordance\nwith our Constitution, took office, and a consensus\nGovernment was established. The economic measures that\nhad been adopted by the Security Council were suspended,\nand they will be lifted definitively at the end of the\ntransitional process. Technical assistance, to strengthen the\ninstitutions and to consolidate democracy, is taking shape\nthrough the United Nations Mission in Haiti, which is\nalready beginning to be deployed.\nWith a view to fostering national reconciliation,t h e\nPresident of the Republic has granted an amnesty in respect\nof political offences committed during the period of the coup\nd\u2019\u00e9tat.\nOther steps remain to be taken before October 30, when\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the\ndemocratically elected President, returns to Haiti to take up\nagain the mandate conferred upon him by the Haitian people.\nNone the less, recent events, characterized by an\nupsurge of violence, greatly discredit the political will of the\nother party to respect scrupulously all the terms of the\nGovernors Island Agreement and the New York Pact. Just\na few hours ago, armed groups demonstrated at Port-au-\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nPrince to oppose the arrival of the members of the technical\nmission of the United Nations. The national radio station\nwas under assault by armed individuals manifestly opposed\nto a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Such behaviour clearly\njeopardizes the success of the Governors Island Agreement.\nThe setting up of such institutionalized mechanisms of\nviolence and intimidation by factions opposing the\nestablishment of democracy and the growing number of\nhuman-rights violations worry us, because they reveal the\ndeliberate bad faith of institutions whose function it is\nprecisely to safeguard security and our citizens\u2019 exercise of\ntheir rights.\nAware that this situation cannot go on, we send out\nfrom this rostrum a sincere appeal to all those who wish in\ngood will to build a better life today and a better future for\nthe children of Haiti and to give to our country an\nopportunity to renew its path of progress. We also appeal to\nthe international community to maintain its pressure so that\nthe minority forces opposing the democratic aspirations of\nthe Haitian people will find themselves completely isolated\nand so that they will have no choice other than dialogue and\nreconciliation.\nThe return of constitutional order in Haiti is part of the\ngenuine international political plan for which we have\nfought, and it symbolizes at the same time an effort for a\ndemocratization process in Haiti and, at the world level, the\ntriumph of law, supported by the moral solidarity of the\ninternational community.\nThe free and honest elections of 16 December 1990,\nwhich brought President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power,\nrepresent the country\u2019s first democratic experience since its\nindependence, the first application of the Haitian\nConstitution of 1987 and, above all, the first step towards\nguaranteeing the rights of the citizen. Our experiences over\nthe past two years have convinced us that the protection of\ndemocracy and fundamental rights is a cause that transcends\nour national borders and takes on an international dimension.\nThe return of constitutional order in Haiti will be a\nvictory of the State and the rule of law over totalitarianism\nand imposture, an ongoing struggle that unites us all and\nmakes it possible for us to confront those who jeopardize\npeace.\nWe know that in the absence of democracy and,\ntherefore, in the absence of the institutions and structures of\nthe rule of law, the protection of human rights would be\nquixotic and ineffectual, especially in my country. This\ndemocracy requires real participation, pluralistic and\ntransparent. This democracy, in our view, cannot mean only\nthe holding of periodic elections; it means, rather, a\ncollective way of life in an adapted economy.\nThe invaluable support of the international community\nwill make possible the return of constitutional order in my\ncountry, and we shall apply all our national resources to the\nconstruction of a State where the rule of law genuinely\nprevails, a State that does not content itself merely with\nguaranteeing public freedoms, but that also seeks to promote\nequality and solidarity. This is the challenge we shall try to\nmeet, because we firmly believe that a State in which all its\nchildren cannot live because of dictatorship and barbarism is\nunacceptable at the dawning of the twenty-first century.\nThe political stakes the international community must\nface are compounded by economic, social and cultural\nchallenges. Poverty, ignorance and the scourge of disease\nare still negative factors threatening the very cohesion of\nStates and continuing to cause gross imbalances in the\ncountries of the South, especially the least developed among\nthem. An unbridled imitation of Western models has led\nsome countries to ignore almost completely the value of\ntheir heritage of creativity and wisdom and their enterprising\nspirit. The result is the absence of a cultural dimension of\ndevelopment and a lack of participation by an important\nsector of their societies: the most impoverished sector,\nwhich is unable to protest, or to protect its own interests, a\nsector made up especially of women, children and the\nmasses of disenfranchised poor.\nEfforts have been made at the national, regional and\ninternational levels. A certain amount of progress has been\nachieved. In spite of all that, the values proposed -\nentrepreneurship, growth, profit and so on - remain\ninaccessible to the great majority of people living in the\ncountries of the South. This poses a grave threat to one of\nthe very cornerstones of human rights: the right to\ndevelopment.\nDay by day the world is becoming increasingly\ninterdependent and, in a sense, increasingly integrated. We\nare confronting a profound transition that promises to be\ncomplex and hazardous. We must do our best so that this\nglobalization, this world economy, will not further widen the\ngap between North and South. The absence of an equitable\nsystem is being felt increasingly. The South remains in a\nposition of subordination and dependence which prevents it\nfrom managing this new world order well. Global initiatives\nare indeed necessary. As we approach the twenty-first\ncentury a profound reform of the international system,\nparticularly in the fields of trade, finance and technology,\nhas become vitally important. I do mean profound reform,\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11\na reform that will bring about a restructured dialogue\nbetween North and South; a reform that will lead to viable\nand sustainable economic growth for the countries of both\nNorth and South, a growth which will be measured not only\nby growth in gross national product but also by certain social\nand political achievements; the access by all without any\ndiscrimination to fundamental services such as food, health-\ncare, housing and appropriate education; and access to a\ndemocratic form of government and effective system of\njustice to protect all the people.\nLasting, bold and courageous solutions must be found\nif we truly want to lift the barriers that prevent the economic\ndevelopment of the group of countries to which we belong.\nThe questions of debt, delays in the flow of technology,\nof capital, and of direct investment to the countries of the\nSouth, the constant decline in the prices of commodities,\nworsening access to markets and deterioration in the terms\nof trade are all questions that need to be discussed seriously\nby the international community if we are to arrive at a better\nbalanced, new international economic order.\nThe Republic of Haiti, which over the past two years\nhas experienced a situation that the Security Council\ndescribed as unique and exceptional, is now at a crossroads.\nIn order to restore the process of democracy and the rule of\nlaw in the country the population of Haiti and its legitimate\nGovernment have made enormous sacrifices. These\nsacrifices, together with a long history of corruption, denial\nof rights, and plundering, have led to disaster at the\neconomic, social and environmental levels. Whole sectors\nof national production have been destructured and the\nenvironment has been dramatically affected. The social cost\nof a return to democracy is extremely high and has therefore\nin advance jeopardized all future endogenous development\nefforts.\nThat is why we ask for the unfailing support and\nbacking of the international community, which, we feel,\nshould in the short-, medium- and long-term involve\nsubstantial, increased and strengthened technical and\nfinancial cooperation.\nThe time has come to transform the vast upsurge of\nsolidarity which we have seen in the course of the past two\nyears, into a powerful, concerted effort at open, fruitful and\nsubstantially enhanced cooperation.\nThe Organization, better than anyone, is aware of the\nbreadth of the challenges today confronting the Government\nof Haiti. It would be futile to hope for a strengthening of\nthe rule of law, which remains our priority objective, if we\nare not able rapidly to alleviate the enormous distress facing\nthe overwhelming majority of the Haitian people.\nWe want to be assured that today as in the past the\nOrganization will continue to stand by us at this crucial\nstage, as a result of which socio-economic conditions should\nbe substantially improved in a Haiti that is reconciled with\nitself and in which rights and freedoms flourish.\nWhile we recognize that no price can be placed on\npeace we do believe that it requires dialogue and\nreconciliation, without which the process of transition cannot\nlead to lasting democracy.\nThe fashioning of a new world has been the shared\nresponsibility of us all since the founding of the\nOrganization in 1945. At the San Francisco Conference the\nHaitian delegation, imbued with the historic responsibility of\nbeing the first black republic in the world, had understood,\nabove and beyond the inspiration of the day which led to the\nestablishment of the United Nations, that the Organization\nrepresented an opportunity not only for our island nation but\nalso for all responsible countries that would join this\ncommunity of nations.\nWe want to take this opportunity to extend a warm\nwelcome to the new Member States and we hope that the ad\nhoc committee which is to study the question of Taiwan will\nfind a solution that is satisfactory to all the parties\nconcerned, in keeping with the fundamental principles of\ninternational law.\nLet us take the tremendous opportunity being given to\nus today to build the new world that generations of men and\nwomen are awaiting; let us take this opportunity to help each\nother by establishing a continuous dialogue between North\nand South in order to find urgent responses and solutions to\nthe problem of underdevelopment and poverty, that ailment\nof our century which has shaken mankind. May dialogue\nbecome our password.\n"

        "file_text": "Please allow me first of all to extend to\nAmbassador Insanally of Guyana on behalf of the\nMauritanian delegation its most sincere congratulations on\nhis unanimous election to the presidency of this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that his\nexperience and his comprehensive knowledge of the\nworkings of the Organization, together with his personal\nqualities, will be the best possible guarantee for the success\nof this session and the completion of its work with the\nresults we all hope for.\nIt is also a pleasure for me to congratulate his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Minister of Foreign Affairs\nof Bulgaria, on the exemplary manner in which he conducted\nthe work of the preceding session.\nIt is also a pleasure for me to reiterate to my brother,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our confidence and great respect\nfor the efforts he has constantly deployed since he assumed\nthe duties of Secretary-General of the United Nations, to\nconsolidate the universal reputation of the Organization and\nto strengthen its credibility and capacity to act.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to welcome\nthe States which have recently acceded to the membership\nof the Organization and to extend to them the\ncongratulations of the Mauritanian delegation. We are\nconvinced that their presence in our midst will consolidate\nthe Organization\u2019s effectiveness in the interest of all its\nmembers.\nThe past year has not witnessed any tangible\nimprovement in the international economic situation. A\ncombination of negative factors such as natural disasters and\nthe deterioration of commodity prices continues to widen the\ngap between developing countries and the industrialized\ncountries, hence the failure of efforts made by the former to\nemerge from the sphere of underdevelopment and poverty.\nThis situation has continued to deteriorate because of the\ncrisis provoked by the growing increase of the debt burden,\nwhich is a threat not only to the economic and social\ndevelopment of developing countries but also to their very\nsurvival. It is now an acknowledged fact that Africa is the\ncontinent which suffers most from the deteriorating\ninternational economic situation, in particular because of its\ntremendous debt burden. How could one really believe that\ncountries which have barely enough resources to meet their\nown daily needs and the needs of their people might be able\nto cope with such obligations? Is it not time for the\ninternational community, and the industrialized countries in\nparticular, to give thought to the gravity of such a situation\nand to consider the possibility of participating more actively\nin the quest for realistic and effective solutions to this very\ncomplex and important problem? In this context, I use the\nterms \\\"realistic\\\" and \\\"effective\\\" advisedly, because it is these\ntwo attributes which have been lacking in all the attempts\nmade in this field to date.\nAs for the economic and development situation in\ngeneral, for all the conventions, strategies and agreements\naimed at promoting development, that situation has remained\nstatic and in many countries it has actually deteriorated.\nTangible progress could have been achieved in terms of real\ndevelopment for these countries in general and for the\nAfrican countries in particular if the industrialized countries\nhad honoured the commitments they made in certain\ndocuments - commitments such as the allocation of 0.7 per\ncent of their national income to official development\nassistance and if those countries had implemented the\nprogramme adopted at the Paris 1990 Conference.\nIn this struggle for the development of Africa,\nMauritania remains convinced that the more the sources of\nexternal aid dry up, the greater the need will be for self-\nreliance and the mobilization by every country of its own\nresources. That is the reason why, despite the adverse\ninternational situation and the unfavourable climatic\nconditions, we have been able to meet our basic\ncommitments to our partners in development, whether they\nbe States or institutions.\nIn 1992, our country achieved a 2.5 per cent rate of\ngrowth. It financed from its own resources 20 per cent of\nits investment budget, which amounted to 17.5 billion\nouguiyas. Here I should like to express, in the most solemn\npossible way and in the name of the Government and people\nof Mauritania, our thanks and our gratitude to fraternal and\nfriendly States and organizations for the considerable\nassistance they gave us.\nIt is clear that there is an organic link between\ndevelopment, on the one hand, and democracy and respect\nfor human rights, on the other. Indeed, what value could be\nattached to prosperity and economic progress if we do not\nuphold human rights and safeguard freedoms? What\nobjective for any responsible Government could be more\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nnoble than having its people participate in an effective way\nin the management of their own affairs and the mastering of\ntheir own destiny? In contrast to the situation we have just\nseen which prevails in the economic sphere, the past year\nhas seen a tangible improvement and an increased interest in\nthe field of upholding and respecting human rights. That\nimprovement and that heightened interest were made evident\nin the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna, at which our country was represented by a large\nhigh-level delegation headed by our Prime Minister. That\nhigh-level representation reflected the great importance our\nGovernment attaches to the question of human rights and\ndemonstrated its unshakable faith in the need to formulate a\nuniversal concept of human rights applicable to all without\nany discrimination. There can be no doubt that the\nimplementation of the important results of this Conference\nwill strengthen the progress of peoples towards prosperity\nand stability.\nThe importance Mauritania attaches to the events on the\ninternational scene regarding human rights bespeaks the\ncommitment of our Government to bring our country out of\nthe emergency rule situation that used to prevail in\nMauritania as well as in many other countries. To that end,\nour Government set for itself, as a priority, the guaranteeing\nof fundamental civil rights and the effective involvement of\nits people in the management of their affairs and in the\neconomic and social development policies of the country. In\nthat respect, I am proud to be able to declare here that there\nis not a single political prisoner in our country.\nThe democratic process started with the organization of\nmunicipal elections, which were a sort of school for\ndemocracy within the context of which citizens exercised\ntheir freedom of expression, freedom of speech, the virtue of\ntolerance and freedom of choice. These stages resulted in\nthe adoption on 12 July 1991 of a constitution which\nguaranteed all fundamental freedoms set forth in the\nuniversal declarations and conventions on human rights. The\nconstitution guarantees a clear separation of the executive,\nlegislative and judicial powers. These various institutions\nwere set up and are currently operating in their respective\nspheres of competence within the context of political\npluralism and the freedom of speech envisaged in the\nconstitution - for the first time in the history of our country.\nSeventeen political parties have been set up, and more than\n100 newspapers and magazines have been authorized to be\npublished in complete freedom.\nGiven our awareness of the need to consolidate this\ngenuine democracy and to ensure respect for freedoms and\nrights of all social groups, a law guaranteeing trade union\npluralism that protects, in a clear-cut manner, all the rights\nof Mauritanian workers was enacted in order to protect the\nrights of citizens in the face of administrative red tape, and\nan independent ombudsman, with the rank of Minister has\nbeen appointed to investigate complaints relating to\nadministrative and social problems. To deal with\nadministrative problems and to complete the election of\ninstitutions as set forth in the constitution, the President of\nthe Republic issued a decree which brought forward the date\nof municipal elections. In the field of social affairs, the\nGovernment, which has always attached special importance\nto literacy and to the promotion of the status of women as\nwell as to women\u2019s involvement in national development\npolicies, created a department for each of these sectors.\nHis Excellency the President of the Republic has shown\non more than one occasion the interest he attaches to youth\nand children as an essential asset whose role is absolutely\nindispensable for the present and future of our nation.\nIn the health sector, the choice we have opted for,\nnamely health for all has been based on three essential\npoints: first, a continuation of the hygienic efforts and\npreventive care in their various aspects; secondly,\ndevelopment of specialized medical services; and thirdly,\nmaking available to citizens essential medicines at reasonable\nprices.\nThe satisfaction we feel at the progress achieved in the\nfield of consolidating democracy and respect for human\nrights in our country and for our people is equalled only by\nour feeling of concern at the violations to which those same\nrights are subjected in other countries and against the\ninterests of the peoples in other regions of the world. This\nsituation is a threat to peace and harmony in the entire\nworld.\nDoes it stand to reason that the lives, property and holy\nplace of religions of peoples could continue to be trampled\nand desecrated at the very heart of a continent such as\nEurope with its age-old traditions of democracy and respect\nfor human rights? The atrocities of torture, mass murders\nand ethnic liquidation are all crimes which the Serbs in\nparticular have been perpetrating daily in full view of and\nwith the full knowledge of the entire world, against the\nMuslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This naked defiance\nof the entire international community, requires that the\ncommunity as a whole should assume its full responsibilities\nand act accordingly. In view of this situation, we call once\nagain for pressure to be brought to bear by all legal means\non the Serbs and Croats so that they may comply with the\nwill of the international community.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 27\nMauritania has always set as a priority the question of\nPalestine. It reiterates its constant support for the fraternal\nPalestinian people under the leadership of its sole and\nlegitimate representative, the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO). It is in that spirit that Mauritania\nwelcomed the agreement concluded between the PLO and\nIsrael, because we believe it is an important step which will\nlead, we hope, to a comprehensive solution to the Middle\nEast problem that would enable the Palestinian people to\nregain all their legitimate rights, including the right to self-\ndetermination, and guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from\nall the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City of\nAl Quds. It should also make it possible for all resolutions\nadopted by the Security Council relating to this problem to\nbe implemented, and it should create conditions conducive\nto peaceful coexistence between all peoples of the region.\nMy country, which has the honour of presiding over the\npresent session of the League of Arab States, would like to\nreaffirm here that Arabs have never been warmongers. To\nthe contrary, they have always been a nation oriented\ntowards peace, and working for peace. Now today, the\nArabs, and the Palestinians in particular, have demonstrated\nthat for peace they are capable of going beyond hatred, the\npain, the wounds of the past and the many, many sufferings\nto which they were subjected during the Middle East\nconflict. Could they have made such sacrifices for peace if\nthat were not the foundation, the very foundation of their\ncivilization, and one of their primordial values? Could they\nhave done so if peace were not a way of life and an end in\nitself in their traditions? Does not \\\"peace\\\" in their language\nmean life? Those whose salutation means \\\"peace\\\" and\nwhose prayer ends with peace; those who, when they are\ntransgressed against, react by calling for peace; a people\nbearing such values surely deserves the support of the\nOrganization in bringing about a just and comprehensive\npeace after which they aspire. It is the duty of the\ninternational community as a whole to respond positively to\nthis just aspiration for the recovery of legitimate rights.\nIn this part of the world, the Middle East, the\nconsequences of the Gulf war are still there to see in every\ncountry of the region. Mauritania, which has always\naffirmed and continues to affirm its commitment to\ninternational legality and which expressed total rejection of\nany violation of the independence of the sister country,\nKuwait and the safety of its citizens, rejects any violation of\nthe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. We appeal to the\ninternational community to alleviate the suffering of the\nchildren and women of Iraq.\nBecause of the moderation, the sagacity and the\nobjectivity which have always characterized the postures of\nthe United Arab Emirates, and also because of the legitimate\nposition of this country with respect to Abu Musa, Greater\nTunb and Lesser Tunb Islands which belong to it, Mauritania\nsupports the position of the United Arab Emirates. We hope\nthat Iran, the sister Muslim country and neighbour, will\nrespond favourably to the legitimate claims of the State of\nthe United Arab Emirates.\nThe Middle East is not the only Arab region which\nsuffers from tension. In the Arab Maghreb, despite\nsustained efforts which have been made for almost five years\nnow, aimed at laying the foundations of a promising\nregrouping which would promise prosperity for the peoples\nof the region, as we have seen in the practical and important\nresults reached at the summit of Nouakchott held in\nNovember 1992, two problems continue to be of concern to\nour leaders and our people. The first problem is the\nquestion of Western Sahara. In that respect, the United\nNations continues to make efforts to smooth out the\ndifficulties, which have heretofore made it impossible to\nreach a solution. While expressing our hope that these\ndifficulties will soon be ironed out, we will continue our\nefforts together with the United Nations and the parties\ninvolved to reach a just and lasting solution. That solution\nwould, no doubt, be an important stage towards the building\nof an Arab Maghreb, and a factor of stability and\ndevelopment in the region.\nThe second problem is the blockade imposed on the\nfraternal people of Libya, which is detrimental to the other\nMaghreb peoples as well. In view of the willingness\nexpressed by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to cooperate with\nthe United Nations and the parties concerned, we should like\nto express our hope that the resolution on the blockade will\nsoon be revised, and that this question will be dealt with\nthrough dialogue and understanding.\nAs for the southern part of the African continent, we\nshould like to record our satisfaction at the new signs of the\ndisappearance of the last bastion of racial segregation, and\nthis is a good occasion to pay tribute to the wisdom and\nfarsightedness of President Nelson Mandela for the path he\nhas followed in dealing with this question. We express here\nour hope that the measures adopted will be fully\nimplemented so that a democratic non-racial regime could be\nset up so that it may guarantee the rights of all citizens of\nthis sister African country.\nIn Somalia, a brother people continues to suffer the ill\neffects of internal divisions, war and famine. If operation\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n\\\"Restore hope\\\", begun last December, resulted in a certain\namount of progress in humanitarian terms, unfortunately, its\npolitical outcome has not been satisfactory to all concerned.\nWe hope that the international community will step up its\nefforts to achieve the objective initially defined for that\noperation. We also appeal to our Somali brethren to\novercome their factional differences and quarrels so that the\nSomali nation may survive.\nTurning to the question of Angola, we hope that our\nAngolan people will listen to the voice of reason and\ncooperate with the United Nations Representative with a\nview to ending this fratricidal war, which serves the interests\nof none of the parties.\nWith regard to Liberia, we note with satisfaction the\npeace agreement that was signed on 25 July 1993, under the\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\nStates. We have every hope that the opposing sides will\nimplement that agreement and put an end to this destructive\nwar, which has been devastating the country for several\nyears.\nIn Rwanda, there are new prospects for peace and\nstability as a result of the signing, in Arusha, on\n4 August 1993, of a peace agreement between the parties to\nthe conflict. We can only applaud this positive step while\nexpressing the hope that it will mark the beginning of a new\nera for the people of Rwanda.\nIt is encouraging that Mozambique has returned to a\nstate of normalcy following the signing, on 4 October 1992,\nof an agreement that made possible the initiation of United\nNations operations there. At the political level, President\nJoaquim Chissano and the leader of RENAMO met on 23\nAugust 1993, thus confirming their determination to put an\nend to the instability that their country has been experiencing\nfor several decades.\nIn Asia, the Cambodian people has achieved a major\nvictory with the holding of the recent elections. All\nCambodians, under the leadership of His Majesty King\nNorodom Sihanouk, must now consolidate that achievement\nso that harmony may prevail and national reconstruction\nbegin. There is no doubt that the United Nations and the\ninternational community will stand by the Cambodians, as\nthey have done in the past.\nThe United Nations, which has an indispensable role to\nperform in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, deserves our full support and help. The\nOrganization\u2019s universal character, which is today given\nexpression in the membership of 184 independent States,\nrequires, more than ever, a revision of its structures and its\nmethods of operation - in particular, through enlargement of\nthe Security Council.\nIn that context, we should like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General for his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the\nstudy and implementation of certain aspects of which has\nalready begun. In this respect, I am very pleased to\nunderscore the fact that at its last meeting, which was held\nin Cairo, the Council of the League of Arab States\nrecommended the strengthening of cooperation and\ncoordination between the United Nations and the League.\nIn two years\u2019 time the United Nations will celebrate the\nfiftieth anniversary of its founding. My country has the\nhonour of being involved in the bureau of the Preparatory\nCommittee for that event, which, we feel, will be a real and\nimportant watershed in the life of the Organization, as well\nas an opportunity for its Members to assess the progress that\nthe international community has made towards achieving the\nnoble objectives that were set for the Organization when it\nwas established in 1945. Let us ensure that that assessment\nwill be positive. Let us do so by redoubling our efforts to\nestablish justice and peace and to promote the cause of man\n- the means and the end of all social- and economic-\ndevelopment operations. For its part, the Islamic Republic\nof Mauritania will continue to move forward in this\ndirection, in accordance with its unfailing determination to\nachieve development - development for man and by man.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all, Mr. President, to\nconvey to you my warmest congratulations. Your election\nto the presidency of this Assembly is a clear\nacknowledgement of your personal qualities and diplomatic\nskills and is a tribute to your country, the Republic of\nGuyana. We are pleased that you were nominated as a\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncandidate by the Group of Latin American and Caribbean\nStates, with which my country has particularly close and\ncooperative relations.\nI should also like to pay tribute to and greet warmly\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The United Nations needs his\nproven competence and political experience in order to face\nthe numerous challenges before us at the end of the century.\nYou may rest assured, Mr. Secretary-General, that in\ncarrying out your complex tasks you can count on the firm\ncooperation of the Spanish authorities.\nAllow me also to convey at this time to the\nGovernment and the people of India our deepest sympathy\nfor and solidarity with the victims of the earthquake that\nravaged that country yesterday.\nOver the last year the universality of the United Nations\nhas once again been enhanced by the admission of the Czech\nRepublic, Slovakia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra as new Members.\nI welcome them all, and most particularly Andorra, a\nneighbour of Spain with which we are linked by special ties\nof history, culture and deep friendship.\nA few days ago Belgium\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs,\nspeaking on behalf of the European Community and its\nmember States, set forth our common points of view in this\ngeneral debate. On behalf of the Spanish delegation, I shall\nmention some issues that I think deserve special attention.\nA year ago, when I addressed this Assembly for the\nfirst time, I referred, as did many other speakers, to the\nfundamental changes that had taken place in the world since\nthe middle of the last decade. It is the Spanish\nGovernment\u2019s firm conviction that those changes have led to\nthe advent of a new era. The United Nations has a great\nopportunity to play an effective, central role in harmonizing\nworld-wide the efforts of the international community in\norder to achieve the common purposes embodied in the Charter.\nThus, it seems that the time has come to strengthen our\nOrganization by providing it with the necessary human and\nmaterial resources to enable it to carry out its goals. We\nmust also think about the measures necessary for a possible\nrevision of the Charter.\nA review of the Security Council is an item on our\nagenda, and this needs to be approached in a constructive\nspirit and with the aim of increasing its representativeness\nand ensuring that its actions be not only fast but also\neffective. Such a review should be based on the criteria\nestablished in Article 23 of the Charter, that is to say, taking\ninto account the contribution of Member States to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to the\nother purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable\ngeographical distribution.\nWe believe that the time has come for a moderate\nincrease in the membership of the Council so as to reflect\nthe increase in the number of Members of the Organization\nsince 1963, when, for the first time, it was decided to\nexpand the Council\u2019s membership.\nWe also deem it appropriate to consider the creation of\nnew categories: one that would enable certain States to\nbecome permanent members without the right of veto, and\nanother that would allow more frequent non-permanent\nmembership in the Council to certain States with weight and\ninfluence in international relations that have the capacity and\npolitical will to contribute significantly to the fulfilment of\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. All this\nwould undoubtedly serve to put our Organization in a better\nposition to face the challenges of maintaining peace and\ninternational security.\nIn this context, it is also necessary to make reforms in\norder to deal with the changing nature of the tasks assigned\nto the peace operations established by the Security Council.\nThe traditional concept of peace-keeping operations,\nembracing monitoring of cease-fire agreements, interposition\nbetween adversarial forces and the establishment of\nconfidence-building measures - all by primarily military\nmeans - has been expanded, increasingly encompassing new,\nnon-military aspects. These new tasks range from\nhumanitarian assistance to nation-building, and include the\nmonitoring of elections and of the observance of human\nrights. Nearly 100,000 men and women from all over the\nworld are currently serving in the framework of these\nincreasingly complex and demanding operations.\nThe United Nations has made a commendable effort to\nadapt the structure and functioning of peace operations to the\nnew exigencies. We should pursue our efforts in this\ndirection, as we are convinced that it is always preferable to\nsolve a conflict under the aegis of the United Nations than\nthrough the unilateral action of a Power or group of Powers\noutside the framework of the Organization.\nHere I should like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to\nsome relevant questions regarding the proper functioning of\npeace operations and to offer some ideas and suggestions\naimed at enhancing their performance and effectiveness.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17\nWhen establishing a peace operation, the Security\nCouncil should pay the utmost attention to defining\naccurately its mandate. The Council should also receive\nperiodic information on the development of the operation.\nConsultation mechanisms should be established with those\nStates that have a special interest, because of their\ninvolvement in the operation or their troop contributions.\nSpecial attention should also be given to questions of\nsafety. Acts of violence against the Blue Helmets have\nincreased alarmingly because of the growing complexity and\nrisks of the operations. The issue of safety should be\nconsidered most seriously. In this regard we have examined\nwith the greatest interest the Secretary-General\u2019s report to\nthe Security Council and the recommendations of the Special\nCommittee on Peace-keeping Operations. We believe that\nthe use of force against United Nations personnel must be\nregarded as unacceptable interference in the exercise of the\nresponsibilities entrusted to the Security Council by the\nCharter. When such acts occur, the Council should take\nappropriate measures, the first of which should be to hold\nresponsible the perpetrators of the acts.\nThe Spanish Government considers it imperative that\nthe appropriate financial resources be made available to the\nUnited Nations in timely fashion to meet the cost of these\noperations. We all share the responsibility for ensuring a\nsound financial and administrative basis for peace operations.\nBefore a new operation is established, an estimate of its\nfinancial implications should be presented to the Council.\nA the same time, the task assigned to the Security\nCouncil in terms of peace-keeping and peace enforcement\nshould not lead us to forget the competence of the General\nAssembly on budgetary questions and in the field of\npreventive diplomacy, especially peace-building. With the\ncooperation of United Nations operational activities, the\nGeneral Assembly must play an important role in this overall\napproach to international security, as is referred to by the\nSecretary-General in his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nNeither should the Secretariat be overlooked. Its\nstructure and logistical capacity for managing peace\noperations need to be reviewed and expanded. We applaud\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts in this respect.\nAware of the crucial importance taken on by peace\noperations, Spain - which has participated and continues to\nparticipate through a large number of military and civilian\nobservers in various operations, particularly in Central\nAmerica and southern Africa - decided a year ago to send a\nmilitary contingent of about 1,000 soldiers to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina as part of the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR).\nWithin the framework of the increasingly necessary\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\norganizations, my country sent observers to help in\nmonitoring compliance with the sanctions imposed against\nSerbia and Montenegro and is maintaining naval units in the\nAdriatic. Spanish personnel also take part in the observer\nmissions of the European community and the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nThe people and the Government of Spain are proud of\nthe work being done by our forces and observers. I wish\nto take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who have\ngiven their blood and their lives while serving in these\npeaceful humanitarian missions of the Organization.\nSince the beginning of the terrible conflict in the former\nYugoslavia the Spanish people and Government have done\ntheir best to alleviate the suffering of the population and\nhave contributed, within the framework of the Security\nCouncil and the International Conference on the Former\nYugoslavia, to the development of a political process aimed\nat achieving a peaceful solution acceptable to all parties.\nWe have all been appalled by the cruelty of that war and\nfrustrated by the endless negotiations.\nIt is only fitting to acknowledge the splendid work\naccomplished, under extremely difficult circumstances, by\nthe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). We\nwould also express gratitude for the skill and dedication of\nthe co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.\nProvided they can rely on the parties\u2019 basic goodwill and\ncapacity for compromise, their efforts should lead to an\nagreement before this coming winter brings with it a\ndreadful human catastrophe. If the hoped for agreement is\nreached, the international community and the Organization\nwill then be faced with a new challenge, that of guaranteeing\nimplementation of the peace agreement through the\nestablishment of a peace-keeping operation under the\nauspices and authority of the United Nations. Spain would\nbe prepared to contribute to such a force.\nThis year the Security Council decided to establish an\nInternational Tribunal to bring to trial those charged with\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We\nbelieve that this crucial step will also encourage at this\nsession of the General Assembly the speedy completion of\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwork leading to the establishment of a permanent\ninternational criminal tribunal with universal jurisdiction.\nIn the past few months important developments have\ntaken place in various other parts of the world.\nMy Government is following with anxiety and hope\nthe recent events in Russia - with anxiety, because at one\ntime it appeared that the internal stability of that country\nand, therefore, of Europe and the rest of the world, was in\njeopardy, but also with hope that the Russian people\nthemselves will become the masters of their own destiny.\nWe are concerned about the worsening conflict in\nAbkhazia and the continued confrontation in Nagorny-\nKarabakh between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. We appeal\nto the wisdom and capacity for dialogue of all the parties\ninvolved and reiterate our support for the peace efforts of the\nUnited Nations and the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nIn Angola the process of restoring democratic normality\nand coexistence has been seriously hampered by UNITA\u2019s\nrefusal to accept the outcome of free and fair elections, thus\npreventing the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. This\nhas compelled the Security Council to impose sanctions on\nUNITA in the hope that its leadership will reconsider its\nattitude and begin to cooperate in good faith to put an end\nto a conflict of catastrophic human proportions.\nWe wish to recall that a number of the problems arising\nfrom the war between Iraq and Kuwait are still unresolved,\namong them the exchange of prisoners and the return of\nstolen assets by the invader. The fact that Iraq has not yet\nrecognized either the existence of Kuwait as a sovereign\nState, Member of the United Nations, the demarcation of the\nborder between the two countries, which was recently\nconfirmed by the Security Council, constitutes a serious\nobstacle to peace.\nThe persistence of those and other conflicts should not\nmake us forget the progress achieved in the solution of\nmany others.\nHere we would especially mention the success achieved\nin Cambodia through the United Nations Transitional\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC), with the holding last May\nof elections for a Constituent Assembly, elections that paved\nthe way to national unity and reconciliation.\nIn the Middle East, the serious obstacles that were\nthreatening to scuttle the peace process launched two years\nago in Madrid have been overcome. The mutual recognition\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO), along with the signing in Washington on 13\nSeptember of an Agreement on the establishment of an\nautonomous Palestinian regime in Jericho and Gaza, is a\ndevelopment of far-reaching significance. Spain welcomes\nthis fundamental step in the tortured history of the Middle\nEast and is prepared, together with other countries, to\nmaintain its political and economic support in order to\nensure that the Agreement between the Palestinians and\nIsraelis becomes effective. We are aware that the process is\nfraught with difficulties, but we believe that they can be\nsurmounted with the same courage and imagination already\ndisplayed in achieving the recent agreements, and with the\nsupport of the international community.\nIn Africa, new developments have taken place, although\nnot without some delay and difficulties. In Mozambique we\nhave witnessed the implementation of the General Peace\nAgreement, with the invaluable cooperation of the United\nNations Operation in Mozambique (UNOMOZ). In Somalia,\nthe Security Council has given the United Nations Operation\nin Somalia (UNOSOM II) one of the broadest mandates ever\nconferred upon a United Nations operation. It cannot be\ndenied that problems of internal adjustment have been\ncaused by the very novelty and magnitude of the tasks\nentrusted to UNOSOM II, and they will have to taken into\naccount in future peace-keeping operations. Nevertheless,\nthe Operation\u2019s contribution has been vital in reducing the\nconsequences of a catastrophe caused by natural disasters\nand armed rivalries that have claimed hundreds of thousands\nof victims.\nTurning to the question of Western Sahara, I wish to\nexpress Spain\u2019s full support for the efforts being made by\nthe Secretary-General and his Special Representative to find\na solution to the outstanding problems that will make\npossible the holding of a free and fair referendum on self-\ndetermination. That referendum will pave the way for the\nclimate of understanding and cooperation that is necessary\nto deal with the challenges in the region. My country\nresolutely supports the process of integration in the North of\nAfrica and the development of stronger links between\nEurope and the Maghreb.\nWe also welcome the progress made in the transitional\nprocess in South Africa, although we regret the fact that\nviolence still holds sway in certain areas. The progress\nmade in the drafting of a Constitution and the prompt\nestablishment of the Transitional Executive Council are the\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19\nbest possible foundations for the holding of general elections\nin 1994 to prepare the way for a truly representative\nParliament and a democratic South Africa that will be able\nto find its true place in the Organization and in the\ninternational community.\nIn Latin America, a number of recent events deserve\nspecial consideration.\nI should mention first the process of consolidation of\ndemocracy through the free election of civilian Presidents\nand Parliaments in nearly the whole of the continent. That\nfact, enhanced by a number of forums such as the Rio\nGroup, the Central American Summits or the Ibero-\nAmerican Summits, has reversed attempts to violate the\nlegitimacy of the democratic process.\nLatin America continues to place special emphasis on\nthe use of negotiation, mediation and conciliation in solving\nits conflicts, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VI\nof the Charter.\nRespect for international law and democracy are the\nprinciples that have guided and will continue to guide the\nactivities of the international community aimed at restoring\ndemocratic legality in Haiti. Those principles have also\ninspired the decisive agreements with regard to the peace\nprocess in El Salvador, where we hope the recommendations\nof the Ad Hoc Commission and the Commission on the\nTruth will be implemented. Finally, those same principles\nwill be the basis for reconciliation and development in\nNicaragua and Guatemala.\nOnce again this year I have to mention a matter that, as\nthe Assembly knows, is of fundamental importance to Spain,\nnamely, the decolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to reiterate\nmy Government\u2019s firm decision to continue the process of\nnegotiation with the United Kingdom in a constructive spirit\nand on the basis of the Brussels Declaration of 27 November\n1984. Those negotiations should duly take into account the\nlegitimate interests of the population, but be based on the\ndoctrine established by the General Assembly that the\ndecolonization of Gibraltar is not a case of self-\ndetermination but of the restoration of the territorial integrity\nof Spain. The Spanish Government firmly hopes that those\nnegotiations will finally eliminate this anachronism.\nIn the field of disarmament new challenges have\nemerged, such as the need to put an end to the proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction. Now, more than ever, we\nneed to redouble our efforts to move beyond a period of\nconfrontation that belongs to the past.\nThere is a pressing need to strengthen the multilateral\nnegotiating forums to enable them to face the new\nchallenges efficiently. In this respect, my country considers\nthat priority should be given to enlarging the Conference on\nDisarmament, on the basis of a consensus that will enable\ncountries like Spain, which have been participating actively\nin its work for a long time, to become members.\nThere is a clear link between international peace and\nsecurity on the one hand and economic and social\ndevelopment on the other. In this new era, when the United\nNations is renewing its efforts to maintain international\npeace and security, we must note the persistence of deep\ndisparities and serious economic and social problems\nbesetting all countries, in particular the developing countries.\nTo confront these challenges, the reform of the United\nNations should extend to the Organization\u2019s economic and\nsocial machinery. The reforms, which have already begun,\nshould be aimed at achieving more effective functioning and\nat using available resources more rationally to meet the\nneeds of developing countries.\nIn that context, let me mention the convening of the\nfirst session of the Commission on Sustainable Development.\nWe hope its work will maintain and even intensify the great\nmomentum generated by the Rio Summit on environment\nand development and lead to the speedy implementation of\nthe commitments made there in Agenda 21.\nBut it is not enough to repair and fine-tune the\nmachinery we intend to use to deal with the challenges of\ndevelopment. We need clear guidelines by which to steer it\nunerringly towards the wide range of current needs, in\nparticular those of the developing countries. Hence, we look\nforward with great interest to the Secretary-General\u2019s\n\\\"Agenda for Development\\\"; in conjunction with \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\", this will supplement the guidelines for action by\nthe international community with respect to the indivisible\nequation of world peace and economic and social\ndevelopment.\nIn that context, I want to recall that the third\nIbero-American Summit, held at Salvador de Bah\u00eda, Brazil,\nlast July, considered \\\"An agenda for development\\\", with the\nemphasis on social development. The conclusions adopted\nby the Heads of State or Government of the 21 participating\ncountries were submitted to the Secretary-General as a\ncontribution to the preparation of his own \\\"Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\".\n\nThe final document of that Summit stressed the\ngrowing interrelationship among the concepts of\ndevelopment, democracy and human rights. It drew\nattention to the priority that should be given to the fight\nagainst poverty both on the governmental level and when\nallocating resources and creating machinery for international\ncooperation. Our starting-point should be to promote\nintegrated economic and social development, bearing in mind\nthe three priorities the Secretary-General set out at the last\nsession of the Economic and Social Council: redistribution,\nintegration and protection.\nThe structure of and developments in the world\npopulation give rise to grave uncertainties about their\nconsequences and about the aspirations of developing\ncountries to attain sustainable development. These and other\nimportant issues such as large-scale migration, improving the\nmachinery for cooperation, and managing resources for that\npurpose will be discussed at the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development to be held next year at Cairo.\nWe hope that Conference will mark a significant step\ntowards the solution of these questions by addressing\ntogether the issues of population, economic growth and\nsustainable development.\nThe Spanish Government considers that there is also an\nurgent need to integrate women into the development\nprocess, eliminate discrimination against women and ensure\ntheir full participation in the economic, social, cultural, civic\nand political spheres. We trust that this commitment will be\nrenewed and buttressed by the international community at\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in\nBeijing in 1995.\nThe World Summit for Social Development, the\nconvening of which my country strongly supported from the\noutset, is to be held at Copenhagen in 1995. It will give a\npolitical impetus to improving the living conditions of the\nmost disadvantaged sectors of our populations. It will help\npromote their social integration and the creation of a concept\nof social development taking into account the relationship\nbetween peace and well-being, while aiming to reduce\npoverty and increase employment.\nYear after year from this rostrum we emphasize our\nfirm intention to build a better world in which the protection\nand promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nwill become real and effective. Unfortunately, year after\nyear we are forced to observe that, despite all our efforts, the\npractices that endanger human life, freedom and security\npersist. It is therefore no longer enough to state our\nreadiness to step up our efforts; we must now move, in\nsolidarity, to action.\nIn that respect, the outcome of the Vienna Conference\non human rights gives us an excellent opportunity to work\nsteadfastly towards our common goal. We now have a set\nof universal rules, universally accepted; we must now insist\non their obligatory application. There can be no democracy\nwithout respect for human rights, and without democracy\nthere cannot be the harmonious, balanced and lasting\ndevelopment to which we all aspire.\nFor that reason, it is of high importance that we\nproceed expeditiously to implement the Vienna\ncommitments, in particular the programme of action. In the\nview of the Spanish Government there are two key issues\nthe resolution of which could lead to unprecedented progress\nin this area. First, we must agree on the establishment of\nthe office of a high commissioner for human rights; and\nsecondly, we must provide the United Nations Centre for\nHuman Rights with the resources it needs to carry out its\nmandate fully.\nIn my statement today I have tried to address the most\npressing challenges facing the Organization, challenges\ninherent in the increasingly free but increasingly uncertain\nworld in which we live. I have also advanced proposals for\nthe reform of the Organization aimed at adapting it to the\nnew circumstances.\nIt is difficult but necessary that we focus both on the\nnew problems and on the reform of the Organization. Our\nability to do this will determine whether the United Nations\ncan increasingly serve as the proper forum for resolving\nworld problems.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, let\nme start by congratulating you on your election to this high\noffice. I am sure that under your leadership this year\u2019s\nGeneral Assembly will be particularly successful and\neffective.\nToday is the first time that a representative of the\nCzech Republic has had the honour to address the United\nNations General Assembly as part of the general debate.\nThe Czech Republic is indeed a new State. Still, the\ndivision of Czechoslovakia is nothing to be happy about. It\nis always better for equal communities to unite than to\nseparate. However, once we determined that the continued\nexistence of Czechoslovakia could not be assured by quiet\nand peaceful means, we strove to separate peacefully. While\nin other parts of the world similar separations are frequently\naccompanied by terror and violence, in our country not a\nsingle window pane was broken. This experience makes us\nbelieve that good will and common sense can lead to\npeaceful settlements, even of problems traditionally\naccompanied by violence.\nThe Czech Republic is currently undergoing profound\npolitical and economic changes. On the political side, we\nare constructing a democratic regime in what used to be the\ncommunist world. The Government has proven to be a\nstable one. Meanwhile, we emphasize human rights, and our\nrobust press freedom as well as our human-rights record\nhave been recognized even by very finicky non-partisan\ninternational organizations.\nOn the economic side, the Czech Republic has also\nchalked up certain successes. Privatization of property that\nwas formerly State-owned is continuing apace. Prices are\nbeing freed so that they can find their natural, market-driven\nlevel. Meanwhile, we have managed to maintain tight\nmonetary policies, keep inflation and unemployment at rather\nmodest levels, and hold to a balanced budget. We live\nwithin our means.\nIn this context, let me emphasize one thing. We are\nmanaging the process of economic transformation with our\nown efforts and our own resources. We do not ask for\ndirect financial assistance. We do not seek to siphon off\nscarce development resources from countries whose situation\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 13\nis much worse than ours. We tell our friends from\ndeveloped countries, \\\"We seek trade not aid from you.\nOpen your markets to us, not your pocketbooks.\\\" Actually,\nopen markets would benefit all of us, whether our economies\nare developed or developing, settled or in transition. This is\nwhy we are convinced that the successful conclusion of the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade would finally benefit us all.\nIn addition to the transition of our domestic political\nsystem and the transformation of our economic system, we\nhave also modified our foreign policy. One of our foreign\npolicy priorities concerns Slovakia. Over the last months,\nthe Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have been\nlearning how to live together as two independent countries,\nrather than as two regions of the same country. We have\nconcluded a series of agreements and treaties, and have\nbecome used to having an international border between us -\na border, I stress, which is peaceful.\nWe are assuming our natural place in Europe. My\ncountry has recently been accepted as a member of the\nCouncil of Europe, which my President is about to address\nin a day or two. Just two days ago in Luxembourg I signed\na Europe Agreement with the European Economic\nCommunity. Also unmistakable is the transatlantic\ndimension of our diplomacy, as exemplified by our activities\nwithin the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE) and the North Atlantic Council for\nCooperation (NACC), and by our interest in joining the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nOur relations with the developing world have also been\nchanging. On the one hand, there is a long history of\nfriendly relations with many countries which we are now\ntrying to put on a new and more balanced footing. On the\nother hand, we are seeking cooperation with a number of\nimportant countries which until recently had been ignored for\npolitical reasons. Thousands of physicians and technicians\nfrom the developing world who have been trained in our\nuniversities act today as so many goodwill ambassadors for\nus. I am sure that in a short time we will be able to provide\nappropriate economic assistance to needy regions of the\nworld, preferably through multilateral channels.\nOur foreign policy is that of a small country and\nreflects that country\u2019s position in Europe and in the world.\nIt is, however, an independent foreign policy which is not\nbeholden to anyone and which does not blindly copy the\nforeign policy of any other country.\nThe end of the cold war era is connected with the fall\nof European communism, and its consequences have not yet\nbeen fully grasped. While the danger of a world nuclear\ncatastrophe has significantly abated, conflicts provoked by\npolitical, ethnic, religious, social and economic disputes have\nflared up. Meanwhile, rays of hope have appeared in\nregions where we perhaps did not expect them. I have in\nmind the prospects for a peaceful settlement in the Middle\nEast, the shaping of a democratic process in the Republic of\nSouth Africa and last, but not least, the success of the\nUnited Nations in Cambodia.\nIn recent days we have been following with great\nconcern developments in the Russian Federation. We had\nhoped that Russia\u2019s problems would be settled peacefully,\nbut the anti-reformist opposition initiated violence. Free and\ndemocratic elections are the only solution to the situation.\nElections will determine whether those who waved the\nRussian flag in Moscow or those who waved the communist\nred flag should guide Russia\u2019s future.\nPost-cold-war conflicts have shaken many of the values,\nprinciples and certainties with which we have been living.\nNowhere have these values been questioned as radically and\nas viciously as in the countries of the former Yugoslavia\nduring the several wars that have taken place there in recent\nyears. Wars in the former Yugoslavia, the Caucasus and\nelsewhere have made us aware of the need to ask old\nquestions anew, to re-examine concepts that have been basic\nto international politics since the Second World War.\nThese questions concern, for example,\nself-determination; the role of internal borders as new States\nemerge; non-interference in internal affairs; international\nrecognition of new States and its timing; and probably\nothers. We will need to scrutinize them far more daringly\nand rigorously and with far greater imagination. Here, I\nthink, is where some of the greatest challenges for the\nUnited Nations will arise in the immediate future. This is\ntreacherous ground, but it might offer one possible vehicle\nin the search for guidance in the times ahead.\nToday, however, the fighting in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina seems to be resulting in a division of that\ncountry along ethnic lines. We find the enforced\ncoincidence of statehood with ethnicity odious. We cherish\nthe principle of a civic society in which citizens enjoy equal\nrights regardless of their ethnic background, mother tongue\nor religious creed. By contrast, we feel that ethnic, not to\nmention religious, purity is a concept from another age,\nirrelevant in the modern world. We regard as inadmissible\nany violent changes of frontiers as well as \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\naccompanied by massive and flagrant violations of human\nrights.\nOne need not stress how important for my country -\nparticularly when it was not free - was adherence to human\nrights, including their codification by the United Nations.\nIndividual, universally valid human rights and their\nobservance are inseparably linked to democracy and\nprosperity. This year\u2019s World Conference on Human Rights\nheld in Vienna was an important turning-point. In our\nopinion, a more effective use of the means spent on the\nprotection of human rights, the concentration of activities\ninto one body, and the establishment of the office of a high\ncommissioner for human rights would be steps in the right\ndirection.\nThe Czech Republic is proud of its share in the work\nof the United Nations. Let me mention some of our\ncontributions. Currently we have military observers in\nMozambique and in the former Yugoslavia. Two more\nteams are to be deployed in Georgia and in Liberia. Others\nhave helped keep the peace in Angola and in Somalia. We\nhave an infantry battalion stationed in Croatia under the\ncommand of the United Nations Protection Force. Our\ncivilian observers monitored Haiti\u2019s elections. Our military\nparticipated in the liberation of Kuwait. Our specialists are\nworking for the United Nations Special Commission. A\nlarge group of security personnel is about to join the United\nNations guard contingent in Iraq. Our officers also served\nfor 40 years on the armistice line in Korea as members of\nthe Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.T h i s\ndemonstrates our tradition of service to the international\ncommunity, a tradition of shouldering our fair share of the\ninternational burden.\nAlong different lines, we have participated for 30 years\nin the work of the United Nations decolonization Committee.\nAnd as I look around this Hall, I realize that there is not a\nsingle country among the 130 or so which have been\nadmitted after the founding of the United Nations that we\nwould not have helped assume its seat here.\nAs members of the Assembly know, the Czech\nRepublic is running in elections for one of the non--\npermanent seats on the Security Council. We are running on\nour record - our record of service and the record of our\nexperience. On this basis I ask members for their support in\nthe forthcoming elections.\nAs many have already mentioned in the general debate,\nthe world is different than it was 50 years ago.\nConsequently, the United Nations and its Security Council\nhave reached a turning-point. Still, it is the considered\nopinion of my Government that, on the whole, the Security\nCouncil now serves us well. In the past few years, it has\nceased to be a mere side-show in world politics. Indeed, it\nhas frequently come to occupy centre stage. As a result, the\nCouncil and the United Nations as a whole are striving to\nmeet the rising expectations the world is pinning on them.\nWhatever changes we suggest, we must proceed\nresponsibly in efforts to reform the Council, in the spirit of\nmutual understanding and consensus. The Security Council\nmust adapt to the new political, economic, social and\nsecurity realities of the world. Some countries have become\nimportant members of the international community. An\nexpansion of the Security Council must above all respect\nprinciples of effectiveness and responsibility for\nimplementing its own decisions. A just geographical\nrepresentation is equally important.\nHowever, some changes should be made today. There\nis a certain sense of frustration among non-members of the\nSecurity Council, which is steadily increasing the number of\nits informal meetings behind closed doors. We need greater\ntransparency. We need more communication. We need a\nbetter balance between the Council and the General\nAssembly.\nIn this respect, distributing the monthly agenda of the\nSecurity Council to Members is a welcome first step.\nInviting the chairmen of regional groups for briefings is also\nhelpful. I am sure that the Council will find further\nmeasures along these lines that could be implemented\nimmediately. If the Czech Republic is elected, my\nPermanent Mission will try to identify other such measures.\nThe credibility of the United Nations hangs on, inter\nalia, the performance of some 80,000 military and civilian\nmembers of United Nations forces in 17 peace-keeping\noperations all over the world. Crisis management now\nincludes not only the classical separation of adversaries but\nalso the protection of humanitarian convoys, the monitoring\nof elections and the observance of human rights. Peace-\nkeepers are sent more often to countries where there are no\nfunctioning Governments and where agreements are worth\nonly the paper they are written on. Thus, Blue Helmets are\nincreasingly becoming the targets of uncontrolled armed\ngroups. Even as we hold this general debate, members of\npeace-keeping forces are dying in clashes with warlords.\nThe Czech Republic welcomes the intensifying\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\". The resolution adopted at the forty-seventh session\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 15\nof the General Assembly is a first step, however small, in\nthe right direction. However, much more intensive\ncooperation not only among Member States but also between\nMember States and the United Nations Secretariat is needed\nin order to create an effective mechanism of functioning\npeace-keeping. The work of our Organization must\ncorrespond to the changing character of peace-keeping. One\ninteresting idea is the proposal to create a working group\nunder the auspices of the Security Council that would review\nthese issues and prepare proposals and recommendations.\nThe considerable number of regional and domestic\nconflicts is a part of the global security picture. Cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional institutions is\nanother useful instrument for solving them. The Conference\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is one\norganization that plays an important role in the Euro-Asian\narea. The first formal step towards cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the CSCE was resolution 47/10, adopted\nat the last session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nNot by accident, the cooperation and coordination of these\ntwo organizations was formalized during Czechoslovakia\u2019s\npresidency of the CSCE. The limited resources of both\norganizations force us to try to coordinate and complement\ntheir operations and missions.\nGuided by our own vital interests, we have been\nstriving to develop closer cooperation and interaction with\norganizations capable of giving effective security guarantees.\nThis, however, does not mean we want passively to let\nothers look after our security. On the contrary, we wish to\nbe active participants in this two-way process. This effort\ninvolves, for example, the following: first, our constructive\ncontribution, as a country with an advanced nuclear industry,\ntowards the strengthening of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its extension\nbeyond 1995; secondly, the adoption of obligations to reduce\nthe risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\ntheir means of delivery, particularly through joining the\nMissile Technology Control Regime and the so-called\nAustralia Group; and thirdly, the early ratification and\nthorough implementation of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and\nUse of Chemical Weapons.\nA financial crisis is threatening our Organization. The\nfinancial discipline of Member States is but one prerequisite\nfor improving the situation. Equally important is the need\nto make more effective use of available resources and to\nstrengthen the control of Member States in using them. We\nneed to make better use of existing control mechanisms. We\nfavour the creation of a strong, meaningful post of an\ninspector general.\nThe United Nations system also pays great attention to\nthe problems of social development, and a lot of good work\nhas been done since development programmes and\nspecialized agencies were established. The Czech Republic\nconsiders the problems of economic and social development\nto be one of the priorities for international policy-making, as\nthese issues directly influence other current burning issues,\nsuch as local and ethnic wars, drugs, poverty and\nundernourishment in some regions of the world.\nHowever, despite the numerous successes of specialized\nagencies, there is considerable space for further improvement\nof their performance and efficiency. We think there is room\nfor improvement in, inter alia, focusing more carefully on\nspecific targets; eliminating overlap in some activities;\nutilizing available resources more effectively; reducing\nbureaucracy and enhancing flexibility; and developing\ngreater cooperation among agencies.\nEnvironmental issues are also high on our agenda, as\nparts of our country are in the most environmentally\ndevastated areas of the world. The situation is not only\ntaking its toll on people\u2019s health but is also undermining the\neconomy of the country as a whole. Sustainable\ndevelopment is more than a new-fangled catchword for us:\nin our country, it means finding the right balance between\nenvironmental concerns and aspirations of development.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED) was an important step forward in\ntackling this problem in all its dimensions. All\nUNCED-related decisions adopted at the forty-seventh\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly are very\nimportant. The Czech Republic will take part in their\nimplementation, even if not all of them relate directly to its\nnational interests. We welcome the creation of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development. The mandate of\nthe Commission, its programme of work and the experience\nit has accumulated even during the short period of its\nexistence indicate its budding importance. The Czech\nRepublic, as a member of the Commission, is seriously\ninvolved in its work.\nCentral and Eastern parts of Europe border on a zone\nof instability. We have gained priceless experience in\nsolving problems resulting from the disintegration of the\ntotalitarian world, even as we perceive the world through the\neyes of a stable European democracy. This dual vision can\nhelp us identify risks and seek their solutions. We feel we\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nhave something to contribute, and we are prepared to\nshoulder our share of responsibility for world affairs. This\nis one of the reasons why the Czech Republic submitted its\ncandidacy as a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil. We believe we will be able effectively to use our\nexperience and our perception of the world, and we hope\nthat you will all support us.\n"

Bringing both to a successful\nconclusion will be hard, but we have good reasons for\noptimism. Canada applauds the courage and foresight of the\nparties involved, and pledges that it will continue to do its\npart in promoting further advances.\nBut, at the same time, we have also seen tragedies - in\nSomalia, Bosnia, Angola and elsewhere - which have, thus\nfar, defied our best efforts to bring peace.\nIt is against this background, of hope renewed and\nhopes dashed, that I wish to speak about the United Nations\ncentral vocation: the defence and promotion of peace and\nsecurity and the conditions in which they can thrive. It is a\nCanadian vocation as well.\nSince United Nations peace-keeping was invented in\n1956 by Lester Pearson, we have been there; sweating it out\nin the field, taking casualties, doing the tough work for\npeace, in partnership with a growing number of other\nMember States. Since 1956, Canada has fielded almost\n100,000 men and women in United Nations operations in\nevery corner of the world. That contribution has been a\ncostly one for us, not least in lives lost. None the less, it is\na contribution which has been a symbol of pride to most\nCanadians, a tangible expression of our national quest for a\nbetter world.\nCanadians speak from experience born of commitment.\nWe see the changes which must be made and the principles\nwhich must remain immutable. The world is hungry for\nmultilateral solutions to conflict and war. This is our time,\nthe United Nations moment. We are living through decisive\npolitical change. Cold war certainties have given way, but\nin their place we have unpredictability and instability - a\npolitical unease about our future, uncertainty about where\ncollective endeavours can take us. Most countries feel more\nsecure militarily, but our citizens, in their personal lives,\noften feel less secure about their well-being, for themselves\nand for generations to come.\nBut this broader perspective must not obscure the very\nreal military dangers which remain: excessive accumulations\nof conventional arms; the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction - chemical, biological and nuclear; and conflict\nand human misery created by the breakdown of civil and\npolitical society within States and across fragile and often\nnew borders.\nThe world has learned some hard lessons in recent\nyears. First, we have learned that our security is\ninterdependent. Within each specific area of concern -\nwhether military, economic, environment or health - no\nnation can stand alone. We are all affected, positively and\nnegatively, by developments beyond our borders. And our\nown actions, within our own countries, inevitably resonate\nthroughout the wider community of nations.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSecondly, we have learned that our security is\nindivisible. We cannot escape the connections linking\nissues; between, for example, economic growth,\nenvironmental safety and population flows. Deterioration in\nany one area can destabilize the whole. We must think\nabout security more broadly, in terms which address\nfundamental sources of insecurity: questions of economic\ndevelopment and prosperity; environmental integrity;\nfreedom from crime and physical threat; health; membership\nin communities which reflect our values, traditions and\naspirations.\nThirdly, we have learned that genuine security is not\nabout control and repression. It is about striking the right\nbalance of interests, within countries and across borders.\nFourthly, we have learned that we have to find more\ncooperative ways of addressing security issues, ways which\nmaximize the relative strengths of many existing institutions.\nWe foresee a network of collaborative arrangements - local,\nregional and global - forming the building-blocks of a new\nsystem of collective security, all hinged on the focal point of\nthe United Nations.\nThe Charter of the United Nations itself provides useful\nguidance, describing possible relationships between the\nUnited Nations and regional bodies in the pacific settlement\nof local disputes. Cooperation between the United Nations,\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European\nCommunity in Europe; between the United Nations, the\nCommonwealth and the Organization of African Unity in\nAfrica; and between the United Nations and the Organization\nof American States in Central America and Haiti has moved\nus considerably along the path anticipated by the drafters of\nthe Charter. Moreover, regional organizations are often the\nbest equipped to deal with local sources of instability and\npotential conflict, such as water disputes, demographic shifts\nor human rights concerns.\nFor decades, the cold war hemmed us in. That time is\nover. We have it within our grasp to fulfil the promise of\nour Charter, to build a global cooperative security system\ncentred on the United Nations. For it is the United Nations\nalone which can provide a universal forum for elaborating\nnew principles and negotiating new rules and standards.\nAnd it is the United Nations alone which, as a universal\nbody, can bring the full weight of the international\ncommunity to bear on specific critical issues.\nIn the last five years alone, the involvement of the\nUnited Nations in various multilateral military efforts has\ngrown exponentially. Five years ago there were seven such\noperations; today there are 16. Five years ago there were\n9,000 military personnel deployed with the United Nations;\ntoday there are nearly 80,000, more than Canada has in all\nof its regular armed forces. And as we look around the\nworld today, the prospect of even more operations has to be\nseen as inevitable.\nThe transformation in United Nations operations has not\nbeen simply quantitative of late. The fact is that the United\nNations is now engaged in a range of activities which goes\nwell beyond the traditional concepts of peace-keeping we\nhave been accustomed to in the past. Much of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s ground-breaking \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\"\nhas moved from prescription to reality, and rightly so. It is\nquite right to ask whether and under what conditions the\nUnited Nations should commit its resources to the resolution\nof international crises. It is equally right to ask whether the\nUnited Nations has the right tools to do what is asked of it.\n(spoke in French)\nThe rapid expansion of United Nations operations in the\npast several years has been both unprecedented and\ninstructive. In the process we have all learned certain\nlessons, some in a very wrenching fashion. We would all do\nwell to take stock of our recent experience and determine\nhow we can together improve our capacity to act more\neffectively.\nHaving been an active participant in virtually every\nUnited Nations military operation, Canada has made its own\ndiagnosis and come to its own conclusions as to some\nremedies that should be pursued.\n(spoke in English)\nTo begin with, we must improve our collective capacity\nto judge, to determine accurately and dispassionately the\nnature of impending threats and the facts of specific cases.\nWe must also improve our capacity to act, to respond firmly\nand effectively to events before they deteriorate into crises.\nThere are steps we can take now to improve our\ncollective capacity in the field of preventive diplomacy.\nRecent initiatives to strengthen our early-warning system\nshould be implemented. To do that, the Secretary-General\nshould be given the resources necessary for independent\npolitical analysis, analysis that he could draw on before\narmed conflict is unleashed and when non-military\nintervention can still be effective. Not only must warnings\nbe timely; they must also have an impact on decisions. The\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7\nSecretary-General must make full use of the provisions of\nArticle 99 of the Charter to bring to the attention of the\nSecurity Council situations which may threaten peace. This\nwould itself provide a powerful stimulus to global attention\nand necessary preventive action.\nThe United Nations ability to conduct preventive\ndiplomacy through the good offices of the Secretary-General\nmust be strengthened. The Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to\naddress dozens of conflicts and potential conflicts require\ntangible support. The preventive deployment of peace-\nkeepers to forestall conflict, as we have recently done in the\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, can prove very\nuseful and in the long run avoid a much larger commitment\nof scarce resources.\nExperience with the assignment of United Nations\nmilitary forces around the world has, in our view,\ndemonstrated a number of shortcomings. It is incumbent on\nus all to move quickly to respond to them by changing the\nway that business is conducted. First, major operations can\nno longer be run on an ad hoc basis. The management,\nplanning and operational capacity of the United Nations has\nto be reinforced. A permanent strategic headquarters staff\ncapable of controlling two or more large-scale,\nmultidimensional operations has to be put in place. To be\neffective, this headquarters would need a comprehensive\ninformation processing and planning capacity.\nSecondly, the United Nations ability to bring mat\u00e9riel\nand personnel speedily to a theatre of operations and to\nensure coordination between sources of equipment and\npersonnel has to be strengthened. Too often in the past, the\nSecretary-General has had to delay United\nNations-sanctioned operations for want of adequate personnel\nor mat\u00e9riel.\nThe ability to deploy United Nations troops rapidly to\nemerging flashpoints has to be upgraded substantially. At a\nminimum, Member States should enter into formal\ncommitments with the Secretary-General to provide troops\non a stand-by basis and tied to readiness standards, as\nCanada has done in the past year.\nThirdly, United Nations Members have to build and\ndevelop the large cadre of peace-keepers necessary for the\nUnited Nations missions of the future. Peace-keeping\ndemands cultural sensitivity, the ability to mediate and a host\nof other skills. Training will be required, particularly of a\ncorps of senior officers who will have to exercise leadership\nin complex, difficult and dangerous situations. Training\nholds the key to successfully integrating different national\ncontingents into one operation.\nFourthly, we need to ensure that field operations meet\nhigh performance standards. Work on the development of\na common code of conduct and operating procedures for all\npersonnel serving under the United Nations flag should be\nbrought to an early conclusion.\nFifthly, we must also come to grips with the\nincreasingly serious dangers facing our peace-keepers. We\nand others are working to clarify and codify principles and\nmeasures for the protection of United Nations personnel,\nparticularly those involved in peace-keeping operations.\nCanada will be proposing specific provisions for such a\nconvention to be discussed during the coming General\nAssembly session.\nIn the last several years, a range of innovative proposals\nhas been put forward with a view to enhancing the capacity\nof the United Nations to mount effective multilateral military\noperations. Many of these suggestions have been the subject\nof extensive debate in Canada, as they have in many other\ncountries. We have, in fact, been proponents of some of\nthese suggestions. We fully recognize, of course, that ours\nis but one perspective. Actually realizing these necessitates\na much broader level of support by United Nations Member\nStates.\nAccordingly, in the best interests of future United\nNations efforts, it is time that a panel of civilian and military\nexperts with experience in United Nations operations be\ncharged with assessing these and other proposals which\ncould further enhance the operational capacity of the United\nNations. Such a report should be finalized and submitted to\nthe Secretary-General next summer. It should include clear\nrecommendations on both the merits of the proposals and, as\nimportantly, how they could be implemented and financed.\nThe report would in turn would provide us with the basis for\ncoming to collective decisions on whether or not to proceed\nwith any of these. Only in this way can we more\ndefinitively determine not only the potential need but the\nrequisite support for these proposals.\nThe agenda for such a review would include: the\nestablishment of a permanent United Nations staff college\nfor the training of military officers; the creation of more\ntraining facilities for United Nations troops; the development\nof a network of United Nations material supply depots\nstockpiled with equipment for rapid dispatch to new United\nNations operations; the question whether United Nations\nMember States would provide at nominal, if any, cost\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nequipment and mat\u00e9riel which would be made available to\nUnited Nations contingents not having such resources in\ntheir own military establishments; and the creation of a\npermanent rapid deployment force under United Nations\ncommand, based possibly on a new United Nations volunteer\nforce.\nThere may well be other issues that should be on that\nagenda. The key, however, is to have that assessment made.\nMy own Government is committed to reviewing these and\nother related questions in the context of a reappraisal of our\nown military capacity, including our participation in United\nNations operations.\nSecurity is more than simply a matter of being able to\ndeploy adequate numbers of troops on a timely basis.\nModern United Nations missions are drawing on expertise\nfar beyond that of traditional military peace-keepers. There\nis a demand for civilian police, for election workers, for\nhuman rights monitors, for engineers, administrators and\nother specialists to rebuild infrastructure. It is not enough to\nstop hostilities; the United Nations is now expected to build\nthe peace as well.\nWe are moving from a tradition of interposing peace-\nkeepers between hostile forces to new forms of engagement.\nRebuilding societies to stand on their own will be a complex\nand lengthy process. Diplomatic peacemaking, military and\ncivilian peace-keeping and peace-building pose new sorts of\nchallenges. It has become obvious, in our view, that a more\nintegrated and coordinated approach by the United Nations\nis now mandatory if we are to cope successfully with many\nof the crises which draw United Nations military forces. We\nhave had a measure of success in this regard in Cambodia,\nbut far less in other situations, such as Somalia. United\nNations military operations cannot in and of themselves\naddress or resolve the root causes of conflict. That is\nsomething that can be achieved only through a much more\nbroadly based effort, be it political, economic or social. In\neffect, we need a capacity to rebuild, over time, countries or\nsocieties which have suffered structural collapse.\nAn effective system of cooperative security, led by a\nreinvigorated United Nations, will cost money; but then,\ngenuine security always carries a price which is worth\npaying. Resources are limited, and we must all share the\nburden. This means paying United Nations bills in full and\non time. That is what Canada does, and we expect others to\ndo the same. It is difficult to overstate the damage that\nnon-payment and the build-up of arrears does to the United\nNations system, and to our collective capacity for effective\naction.\nBurden-sharing means taking part in the activities of the\nUnited Nations, from contributing troops for peace-keeping\nmissions to providing observers for election monitoring.\nToday, Canada is providing just under 4 per cent of all\nUnited Nations forces. Little less than one year ago,\nCanadian troops accounted for 10 per cent of all United\nNations forces. Those are rather remarkable figures when\nwe consider that Canada accounts for less than one half of\n1 per cent of the world\u2019s population, and that our military\nestablishment represents less than 1 per cent of global\nmilitary expenditures. This is not to suggest that we are\nseeking a diminished role, one more commensurate with our\nrelative status in the world. It is, instead, to question\nwhether others are doing their fair share.\nBurden-sharing also means sharing political\nresponsibility for shaping and taking decisions, and for\nensuring that decisions and commitments are fulfilled. That\nis why we welcome the Security Council\u2019s increasing\nattention to drafting clear mandates, sharply defining\nobjectives and setting deadlines. Clear and realistic\nmandates are necessary if the United Nations is to remain\nboth credible and effective.\nIn Canada as in a number of other countries,\ngovernments are facing difficult fiscal circumstances and\npublics that are demanding more effective, efficient and\neconomical service from government. The need for\nrationalization of government, for streamlining, and for an\nend to overlap, duplication and waste is one that my own\nGovernment has addressed in the last several months. Our\nefforts in that respect will continue. We have a\nresponsibility to our own taxpayers to ensure that the same\nstandards and objectives are applied to the international\ninstitutions of which we are members.\nInstitutions of the United Nations cannot remain\nimmune to the challenges, financial as well as political, of\nthe late twentieth century. They too must help shoulder the\nburden by becoming leaner, more efficient, better focused,\nmore responsible and more responsive. They must adapt,\njust as Member States are doing, to new technologies, to\ncontinuing fiscal restraint, to the challenge to do better with\nless. The structures here are not sacrosanct. No position,\nexpenditure or institution should be free of the scrutiny\nunder which we in Canada, and others elsewhere, have\nplaced our own State structures.\nWe applaud the reforms initiated by the Secretary-\nGeneral and we pledge our support for further action. We\nurge him to press on, and we urge all Member States to\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9\nsupport his efforts. Our security, the security of generations\nto come, is in the balance.\nWe have a great deal to do. All of our efforts to\nreform the peacemaking and peace-keeping function of the\nUnited Nations will be in vain if we are not able to come to\nterms collectively with what must be regarded as the most\ndangerous current threat to international security: the\nubiquitous spread of weapons of mass destruction. In too\nmany areas of the world, the prospect of conflict involving\nnuclear weapons risks destabilizing already tense situations,\nand could lead to human disasters of unimaginable\nproportions. We must muster the collective resolve to put\nteeth into the Non-Proliferation Treaty, disciplining harshly\nthose who violate its provisions and giving confidence to\nthose who abide by its undertakings. We wholeheartedly\nwelcome the priority attached to this issue by President\nClinton, and the practical measures he proposed.\nOur own priorities are clear: further progress in nuclear\narms reduction; indefinite extension and universal adherence\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty; negotiation of a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty; early progress to bring the\nchemical weapons Convention into force; and strengthening\nof the United Nations Conventional Arms Register. These\ndirect investments in peace and security must be\naccompanied by collective action on the root causes of\ninsecurity.\nWe must develop and consolidate democratic\ninstitutions and the rule of law. Modern history teaches us\nthat democracies are the least likely States to wage war, the\nbest guarantors of peace. The impartial rule of law\ndomestically is the surest way of keeping democracies\ndemocratic; internationally, it is the best way to resolve\ndisputes before they become crises.\nWe must protect and promote human rights. Security\nbegins at the level of the individual, and there can be neither\npeace nor security while people, singly or collectively,\nminorities or majorities, are unable to uphold their dignity\nand exercise their inherent rights. The General Assembly\nmust build on the progress achieved at the Vienna\nConference earlier this year and agree to establish by the end\nof this year the post of United Nations high commissioner\nfor Human Rights.\nWe must attack the poverty, deprivation and economic\nunderdevelopment which so often lie at the heart of\ninstability and insecurity. The Secretary-General should\ndraw up an agenda for development. It should incorporate\na bold rethinking of how the United Nations can best play its\nimportant role in the economic and social spheres, while\navoiding the duplication of activities best carried forward\nelsewhere. The Agenda could help redefine the role of the\nUnited Nations in promoting sustainable development in\nclose cooperation with other international economic and\nfinancial institutions. We owe no less to the children of the\nworld as we celebrate the third anniversary of the Summit\nfor Children.\n(spoke in French)\nTo be lasting, economic growth has to respect the\nenvironment. Hence, we have to follow through on our\ncollective commitments at last year\u2019s Rio Summit to protect\nthe environment. The social and economic costs of not\ndoing so are simply unacceptable, a fact that is all too real\nfor the thousands of Canadians dependent on the Atlantic\nfishery.\n(spoke in English)\nThe brutal collapse of the fishery in the North-West Atlantic\nand elsewhere is compelling evidence of the need to address\nthat crisis urgently. The United Nations must urgently adopt\na legally binding international regime to conserve and\nmanage high-seas fish stocks.\nIt is clear, however, that no amount of development\nassistance can match the economic growth that could be\nachieved through a freer flow of goods, services, capital and\nideas among our Member States. Indeed, the single most\nimportant step we can take collectively towards improving\nthe prosperity of developing and developed economies alike\nwould be to reach, without any further delay, a substantial\noutcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations. These discussions have reached a pivotal\nstage; we must not lose this precious opportunity. My\nGovernment remains committed to doing its part to reach\nthat goal and to pursuing other opportunities for trade\nliberalization, such as through the North American Free\nTrade Agreement. We are convinced that the Agreement\nwill make the North American economies both more\ncompetitive and more open and will provide a much needed\nstimulus to global trade and investment.\nOur peace and security are not there for the taking. We\nmust work for them, and work hard - in our own countries,\nin our regions, and globally. We must renew and revitalize\nexisting structures and, where necessary, build anew. We\nhave a historic opportunity to make good on the language of\nthe United Nations Charter, on the thwarted promise of those\nearly days, to build in our own time a cooperative system of\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\npeace and security which respects difference but holds fast\nto universal principles of human dignity and freedom. Let\nus move forward, together, now.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\npeople and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands, I warmly congratulate Ambassador Samuel Insanally\non his election as President of what promises to be a historic\nsession of the General Assembly. I would also like to\nexpress my country\u2019s profound appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Foreign Minister of\nBulgaria, for his superior guidance during a time of\nunprecedented change.\nWe are gathered here at a crucial juncture in human\nhistory when numerous changes are becoming apparent.\nFew of us ever imagined that we would witness in our\nlifetimes the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, a handshake\nbetween the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization, the peaceful separation of Eritrea from\nEthiopia after decades of war, or the transition to a\nGovernment in South Africa that is truly representative of its\npeople. In the current international climate we can be\noptimistic about the peaceful resolution of the difficult\nproblems of our time. However, at the same time our world\nwitnesses these triumphs of the human spirit, it also faces\ngrave new problems, such as the tragedies that are unfolding\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.\nThe new order will require fundamental changes in the\nattitudes and thinking of nations and all mankind. Gone are\nthe clearly defined divisions of super-Power conflict. In\ntheir place are a myriad of problems, suppressed during the\ncold war, that are now resurfacing. The confrontation\nbetween East and West has given way to more intricate\nproblems, without readily apparent solutions. There are no\neasy answers for bringing restraint to the extremes of ethnic\nand religious nationalism, or promoting human rights and\nsustainable development. Yet the past few months have\nshown the real progress that can be made on even the most\nintractable problems. Rather than wringing our hands, we\nmust draw upon the diversity of views represented in this\ngrand Hall and upon the examples of those who dedicated\ntheir lives to the struggle to bring peace to the world.\nThe world\u2019s billions are increasingly looking to the\nUnited Nations for solutions. However, as currently\nstructured and financed, the United Nations by itself cannot\naccommodate the breadth and gravity of the many problems\nit faces. It is our view that the Organization must be\ncarefully re-evaluated to ensure its effectiveness in a\nsituation of new realities. We support the creation of an\nOffice of Inspector General and will continue to study the\nvarious proposals for expansion of the Security Council\nmembership.\nAs proud Members of this body, we cheer our\nOrganization\u2019s successes and are troubled by its few\nsetbacks. The Marshallese people mourn the loss of\nmembers of United Nations peace-keeping missions, which\nare bravely endeavouring to maintain peace and provide\nassistance to those in danger.\nAllow me, for a moment, to address the special\nsituation of the island nations. The physical limitations of\nislands and their lack of natural resources, which larger\n\nnations might regard as insurmountable barriers, we, by\nnecessity, view as challenges to overcome. Throughout\nhistory, islanders have displayed a remarkable degree of\ninnovation and adaptation, which has allowed us to survive\nnumerous natural and man-made disasters. Our people and\nway of life were not deterred by the horrors of modern\nweaponry from which the Marshallese people suffered\nduring the nuclear testing. Despite the end of the super-\nPower arms race, the world must still confront the grave\ndangers of nuclear testing, nuclear proliferation, and the\nproduction, transit and disposal of nuclear material. The\nMarshall Islands will forever have a special interest in the\ndismantling of nuclear weapons because many Marshallese\npeople are still prevented from returning to their ancestors\u2019\nhomeland.\nAs survivors of that legacy, we very much welcomed\nthe nuclear-testing moratorium. We are greatly distressed\nthat this moratorium has now been broken by one of the\nnuclear Powers, and we would appeal to the others not to\nfollow this path. I should like to lend my Government\u2019s\nvoice to the voices of others that have called for negotiations\non a lasting and effective comprehensive nuclear-test-ban\ntreaty that will enjoy universal adherence. It is the wish of\nthe people of the Marshall Islands that no one else should\nhave to endure the same hardships and physical harm that\nwe did. We pray for a world free from nuclear testing and\nintend to participate actively in the steps leading to such a\ntreaty.\nWe were proud to be one of the first signatories of the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction earlier this year in Paris. We will do\nour part to contribute to the goal of the abolition of that\nimmoral class of weapons and commend the many officials\nwho worked on the Convention for their tireless efforts.\nPerhaps the most effective way to avoid the grave\nconsequences of nuclear weapons is to address the problem\nat its source by prohibiting the production of weapons-grade\nplutonium. We therefore look forward to working on a\ntreaty to this effect, and we commend the United States and\nothers for taking the lead in this regard.\nThe islands of the Pacific are especially vulnerable to\nthe dangers posed by transport of nuclear material. We hope\nthat such shipments will cease. If they are to continue, the\nStates responsible must take every precaution to ensure that\nthe safety of States along the sea lanes and the high seas is\nensured.\nAll of humanity is shocked by the brutality of\nnationalist and ethnic conflicts raging throughout the world\ntoday. The possibility of introducing nuclear weapons in\nthese disputes threatens global peace and security and raises\nthe spectre of death and suffering on a magnitude never\nbefore witnessed. My Government will continue to support\nall efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThe efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) in the area of nuclear safeguards merit special\npraise. I am very pleased to report that last week the\nMarshall Islands was accepted as a member of the IAEA,\nand we look forward to contributing to the work of the\nAgency. We are confident that the Agency\u2019s vast expertise\nin the area of protection from radiation can shed light on the\nmatter and at the same time come up with remedial\ntreatment for the many Marshallese victims afflicted by\nnumerous cancerous diseases resulting from nuclear testing.\nMy Government warmly applauds the increased\nattention by the world community to human rights and\ndemocratic institutions. Although it fell short of some of our\nexpectations, this year\u2019s World Conference on Human Rights\nwas an important milestone in the efforts to protect the\nrights of individuals and vulnerable sectors of society.\nPerhaps more important, the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action clearly demonstrated that respect for\nbasic human rights and fundamental freedoms can exist in a\ncontext of cultural diversity.\nAs important as the Vienna Declaration is, it is\nmeaningless without the means to enforce its provisions.\nWe will therefore continue strongly to support efforts aimed\nat creating a post of United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights and a Special Rapporteur for Women\u2019s\nRights, and we will continue to study proposals for an\ninternational court with jurisdiction to consider cases of\nhuman-rights violations.\nTomorrow\u2019s leaders are today\u2019s children. With this in\nmind, we must ensure that our children are well prepared to\naccept the mantle that will be passed on to them. For\ndecades, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has\nadvanced this objective with determination, and we are\nespecially appreciative of its assistance to the Marshallese\nchildren. We are proud to have recently ratified the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, and we encourage\nothers to do the same so that the world may attain\nUNICEF\u2019s goal of universal adherence by the year 2000.\nThe Marshall Islands are endowed with natural beauty\nand a rich cultural heritage. The development potential of\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 3\nour islands resides in the preservation of their fragile\nenvironment. Because our land area is so limited, we treat\nit with the greatest respect and conserve it as best we can.\nGiven the small land area of our atolls, we face\nconstraints to agricultural and industrial development. As\nthe pressure from a growing population increases in my\ncountry, additional demands are made on our resources.\nRegrettably, we have become increasingly dependent on\nimports to meet basic human needs.\nThe long distances from markets of many islands result\nin especially high transport costs. In our case, we are almost\n2,000 miles from the nearest major market for our goods.\nConsequently, transport costs raise the cost of goods to\nlevels that are often not competitive. Even with competitive\nproducts, restrictive trade barriers further limit our access to\nmarkets. We are hopeful that the negotiations of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will produce a\ntrade agreement that is equitable and fair to all nations.\nThe Marshall Islands welcomes with gratitude the\nrecently approved country programme of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). It would be especially\nwelcome if this plan of action could assist my country\nsignificantly along the road to sustainable development. The\nspirit of cooperation that was exhibited at the first round-\ntable meeting in 1991 is evident in this programme. It is\nhoped that this will be the first step in a long and fruitful\npartnership and that the UNDP will become more responsive\nto the special needs of the Marshall Islands. Like many of\nthe island States in the region, the Marshall Islands is not a\ntraditional recipient of overseas development aid, and we\nhave few bilateral partners. Given its regional expertise, we\nare pleased that UNDP is becoming a major focal point for\nour development assistance. UNDP understands the\ncomplexities of the Pacific region and the development\nchallenge for the island States. We hope that the UNDP\nbudget for the region will not be cut back any further. The\nPacific is a vast area, and the logistical challenges faced by\nthe field office in Suva, Fiji, are daunting.\nSustainable development is a primary objective of\nGovernment planning. We are increasingly aware of the\nlimits that constrain our development potential. We want to\nprosper on the resources that we have, but we do not want\nto repeat mistakes that others have made on their road to\ndevelopment. I commend our neighbour, Papua New\nGuinea, for the important work it has initiated to integrate\nsustainable development into the framework of international\nrelations.\nThe Marshall Islands is a small nation, and we\nincreasingly feel the strain caused by our expenditures on the\nUnited Nations. We are, of course, very grateful and proud\nto be a part of this body, but we are becoming worried at the\nscale of new contributions, particularly for peace-keeping\noperations. The burden of membership is not shared equally\nby every citizen of the world, and we would like to see this\ninequity in contributions addressed in some way. If one\nlooks at the cost of United Nations membership on a per\ncapita basis, one sees that the island States are among the\nvery top contributors.\nThe vulnerability of small islands to natural disasters\nand to fluctuations in the world economy make it difficult to\nquantify the well-being of our people. Calculations of per -\ncapita gross domestic product and other traditional economic\nindices do not accurately represent the standard of living in\nthe islands. Perhaps other criteria could be devised to reflect\nthe complexities of our situation.\nThe Marshall Islands was one of the first countries to\nratify the Conventions adopted at the Rio Conference on the\nenvironment. Developments subsequent to the Rio summit\nhave been closely observed by the Marshall Islands\nGovernment. It is our sincere hope that the process initiated\nat Rio de Janeiro will succeed, so that our islands can be\nsaved from possible destruction by global climate change.\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States will increase world-wide\nunderstanding of the vulnerability of our islands. The\nGovernment of Barbados is to be thanked for generously\noffering to host that Conference next year. We are,\nhowever, a little disturbed by the response by some donor\ncountries to the Conference. It must be reiterated that the\nConference has its mandate from Rio and from the forty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly, and that it should\nbe considered as a test case for sustainable development. It\nwill be an attempt to address issues that are specific to small\nisland States in their quest for sustainable development. The\nwill of the global community to live up to the promises\nmade in Rio will face its first test, and the implications of\nthe outcome of the Conference will be significant to all.\nThroughout history the sea has united my people and\nhas been vital to our lives. It provides our nourishment; it\nis a source of income; and our culture and traditions have in\nlarge part been shaped by the ocean. The majority of our\npopulation derives its livelihood from ocean-based activities,\nand our territorial waters abound with fish that can feed\npeople around the world. Clearly, our fate is tied to the\nocean. Today, however, our way of life is threatened by a\nrise in the level of the very ocean that has given us life for\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthousands of years. We are greatly appreciative of the\nefforts and attention given to the problem by the world\ncommunity, most notably in the Framework Convention on\nClimate Change, signed at the Rio Earth Summit, which my\nGovernment is proud to have ratified.\nHowever, for a low-lying atoll like the Marshall Islands\nthe Framework Convention may have come too late. We are\neager that funds from all sectors of the United Nations\nsystem, especially the Global Environment Facility, be made\navailable for the purpose of adaptation to a rise in the sea\nlevel. We also realize fully that changes required of\nresidents of industrialized countries will entail considerable\nsacrifice, at least initially. However, countless studies have\nshown that steps to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions would\ngreatly benefit those countries in the future.\nThe threat to the Marshall Islands is imminent. Our\nway of life is threatened. My country is threatened with a\nloss of identity and culture. We are powerless in the hands\nof others and my country may cease to exist as a result.\nI would like everyone in this Hall to visit our corner of\nthe world before it disappears. I hope that 30 years from\ntoday our islands will not have been swamped by the sea\nand that we will be able to invite you again, rather than\nreferring you to a page in a history book. For many, the\nMarshall Islands may be little more than specks on the map.\nThe peoples of the Pacific hold a very different view of the\nworld: that the world would be greatly diminished by the\nloss of even one of the diverse cultures that have been\ncrafted by mankind.\nLet us strive during the coming months to work in\ntandem and to endeavour to fulfil the grand aspirations and\nlofty goals that this Organization represents. As we do this,\nallow me to offer a Marshallese proverb to guide our work:\n\\\"Jouj eo mour eo, lej eo mij eo\\\" - \\\"Alone we cannot survive,\nbut together we are strong\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure, at the outset, to extend to you the\ncongratulations of the delegation of Morocco on your\nelection to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, and to express to you our best wishes for\nsuccess in the discharge of your important duties. I would\nlike to assure you of our full cooperation in ensuring the\nsuccess of our deliberations.\nTo the outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, I should\nlike to express our appreciation for the wise manner in\nwhich he conducted the work of our deliberations during the\npast session. To our Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, we would like to pay a special tribute for his\ntireless efforts to uphold the principles of the United Nations\nCharter, and to promote international peace and security in\nthe world\u2019s current difficult circumstances.\nI should also like to welcome to our midst the many\nnew Members who have joined our Organization in recent\nmonths.\nAs we approach the end of fifth decade since the\nestablishment of our Organization, it is proper to evaluate its\nsuccesses in attaining the goals set by the Conference of San\nFrancisco in 1945, with a view to maintaining world peace\nand security and ensuring development, prosperity and social\njustice in a world free from the scourges of war, bigotry and\nracism.\nOur Organization was built on the ruins of a World\nWar. It was therefore natural that the effects of that war\u2019s\naftermath left their imprint not only on the United Nations\nCharter but also on the rules that govern its work as well as\non its structure.\nThe rivalry between the two blocs contributed to the\nweakening of the effectiveness of the Organization in\naddressing international issues. However, to do justice to\nour Organization, one cannot but speak of its historic\nachievements in liberating people from the yoke of\ncolonialism and foreign domination, its opening of its forums\nto dialogue between all nations, promoting cooperation\nbetween nations and peoples and its working for the\nsettlement of conflicts by peaceful means.\nThe end of the cold war, the collapse of what used to\nbe called the Eastern Bloc and the sudden disintegration of\nthe Soviet Union, were important and unexpected events of\nhistoric proportions. They transformed the world situation\nand altered its parameters. The result was a radical change\nin international relations, a profound shift in the balance of\npower and the emergence of underlying ethnic and national\nextremist trends which were suppressed under the former\nrule. Those have brought civil wars, unspeakable tragedies,\nsuffering and destruction to many countries.\nWhile it has been difficult under such circumstances to\nfind quick solutions to the old problems of the world as\nsome would have hoped, new issues have arisen that have\nmonopolized the attention of the international community,\ndemonstrating the inadequacy of the means available to the\nUnited Nations and the United Nations inability to keep pace\nwith the changes on the international scene.\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe often-sought intervention by the United Nations in\nareas as diverse as the peaceful settlement of conflicts and\nthe organization and supervision of elections has resulted in\nan increase in its volume of work and has justified the call\nfor the strengthening of the Organization and support for its\nwork. Consolidating the role of our Organization is of great\nimportance and enjoys the steady support of my country.\nPositive, vital and commendable as it may be, the role\nof the Organization remains, nevertheless, of limited impact\nand effectiveness because the Organization\u2019s Charter and\nstructure have not evolved sufficiently and because it lacks\nthe financial resources that would enable it to meet the\nrequirements of its international mandates in all their various\naspects.\nThose transformations have given rise to new concepts,\nnotions and priorities, such as preventive diplomacy,\npost-conflict peace-building, and brought to the fore such\nissues as those of human rights and of intervention on\nhumanitarian grounds in the course of the ongoing global\ndebate on what is termed \\\"the new world order\\\" that is in\nthe making.\nMoreover, the Summit meeting of the Security Council,\nheld in January 1992 in New York, was a testimony to a\ncommon ambition to develop and regulate international\naction in such a way as to make it capable of meeting the\nrequirements of the new situation in the world. As a current\nmember of the Security Council, Morocco - represented by\nHis Majesty King Hassan II - took part in that historic\nmeeting and did not fail to express the sensitivities and\nconcerns of the Muslim, Arab and African world, and\ncontribute fully in the formulation of the final declaration.\nIt is also in this context that the Secretary-General\npresented his thoughts and recommendations about\npeacemaking and peace-keeping in his report \\\"Agenda for\nPeace\\\", which was favorably received by Member States.\nWe believe that those thoughts, concepts and activities are\na positive endeavour on the whole, but they contain certain\naspects which might prove to be dangerous and even\ndamaging. It is therefore imperative that those thoughts and\nconcepts be clarified, with a view to defining their goals\nthrough an all-embracing dialogue between all States. This\nwould lead to a consensus genuinely reflecting the concerns\nof all members of the international community.\nIt is also necessary, now, to supplement those thoughts\nwith views and reflections on how to correct the economic\nsituation which does injustice to the rights of the developing\nworld, whose economic interests have not been included in\nthe international agenda.\nNowadays, human rights issues are the subject of\nheated debate. Morocco, which firmly believes in the\nuniversal character and the comprehensive nature of those\nrights, regards them as a basic pillar of governance, social\njustice and civil liberties in any State. However, my country\nis equally of the view that the concept of human rights\nshould be attuned to the values, cultures, traditions and the\ndiffering levels of development of countries, without any\nimposition of any particular concept of such rights. In other\nwords, the political dimension of human rights should not\nprevail over the social and economic one, which covers the\nbasic needs of man including food, clothing, health care and\nshelter.\nOur constant interest in and tireless efforts towards\nmaintaining international peace and security and the settling\nof conflicts by peaceful means will be futile so long as the\nsocioeconomic imbalance between the developed and\ndeveloping countries continues to increase daily. The\neconomic crises in the developing world have been greatly\naggravated: unemployment and economic stagnation have\nbeen compounded by persisting problems in international\ntrade, by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials.\nMorocco deplores the lack of genuine dialogue between the\nNorth and the South, which has created a situation in which\nsub-Saharan Africa claims less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s\nincome while the developed countries, with only 15 per cent\nof the world\u2019s population, control more than 80 per cent of\nworld income.\nThe discussions in international economic forums are\nalmost exclusively centered on topics of direct concern to\ndeveloped countries while the role of developing nations in\nthe management of the world economy continues to be\nalmost non-existent. In that respect, we regret that the\nrequest made by the current chairman of the Non-Aligned\nMovement to meet with the leaders of the G-7 last July in\nTokyo, to explain the consequences of the present\nmanagement of the world economy on the developing\ncountries, was turned down.\nMy country is convinced that unless the world economy\nis collectively managed in a manner that would take into\naccount the interests of all countries without exception, it\nwould be futile to look forward to an era in which global\npeace and security may prevail, and in which well-being and\nprosperity may be attained by all peoples of the world.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 21\nWhile we concede that the advanced countries too face\na difficult economic situation, we maintain that they still\nhave the potential and the ability to lend a helping hand to\nthe developing world.\nWe also maintain that the time has come for the\ndeveloped countries to demonstrate true solidarity with the\ndeveloping countries by giving them access to the economic\ndecision-making process, and by helping them to develop\ntheir economies and improve their social standards. To this\nend, the developed countries could liberalize the world\neconomy, open their markets to the products of the Third\nWorld, increase their investments in developing countries\nalleviate the debt-burden of those countries and enhance the\neffective transfer of technology to them.\nBy the same token, we believe it is necessary for world\neconomic relations to embark upon a new phase of genuine\npartnership and shared responsibility, within the context of\neconomic interdependence.\nSuch a new approach would prove much more\nbeneficial to the countries of the North since deterioration of\nthe economic and social situation in the South would\ninevitably have a negative impact on the security, stability\nand development of the North.\nWhile calling for a meaningful contribution by countries\nof the North to development, the countries of the South\nremain mindful of the need for self-dependence. Therefore\nmost countries of the South have made the necessary\nadjustments, strengthened the structures of their economies\nand enhanced cooperation among themselves, by using\navailable forums such as the Group of 77 and the Movement\nof Non-Aligned Countries.\nMorocco, which has always demonstrated its utmost\nreadiness to promote South/South cooperation, is still\ncommitted to participate actively in these efforts, in\nparticular with the African countries. Our keen interest in\nAfrica stems naturally from solid bonds of common history,\ngoals and destiny which link us to that continent whose\nconcerns and ambitions we fully share.\nThe lack of stability that characterizes the international\neconomic situation led the African continent to a very\nalarming crisis which has been exacerbated by the falling\nprices of raw materials, a deterioration in the terms of trade,\nthe heavy foreign debt-burden and drought.\nDespite the adoption by the forty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly of a new agenda for the development of\nAfrica and the new reform programme adopted by the\nmajority of African countries in conformity with the\nrecommendations of the international financial institutions,\nthe situation in our continent remains critical and calls for an\nexceptional effort to overcome this crisis.\nIn this context, Morocco spares no effort to assist many\nAfrican countries, for example, by writing off loans,\nextending valuable assistance in the areas of health care and\neducation, and allocating more than 90 per cent of its\ninternational cooperation budget to the assistance of African\ncountries.\nMoreover, Morocco has endeavoured, in consultation\nwith other African countries bordering the Atlantic Ocean,\nto set up, in collaboration with the United Nations and the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n(FAO), a legal framework and relevant structures to create\nmultilateral cooperation in the field of fisheries in order to\nsafeguard the vital interests and national resources of these\ncountries.\nThe present is a crucial period of transition in the\nhistory of international relations, which, while it is marked\nby new and promising prospects of international cooperation,\nis fraught with the danger of the many hotbeds of tension\nwhich proliferate around the world and which give cause for\nconcern.\nThe Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the grip\nof a devastating war that irks the world conscience. This\nhas been the result of the Serbian aggression against the\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Bosnian Serbs especially have not hesitated to\nperpetrate the crimes of genocide, ethnic cleansing, rape, and\nthe destruction of houses of worship and historical and\ncultural monuments in furtherance of their shameful designs,\nin violation of the principles and norms of international law.\nIt is regrettable that the many settlement plans and the\nendless meetings have resulted in nothing other than\nrewarding the Serbian aggressor and increasing pressure on\nthe Muslim majority of that country. Having been unjustly\ndeprived of the legitimate right to self-defence, the Bosnian\nGovernment had to make successive unilateral concessions.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco cannot but strongly condemn\nthe Serbian aggression aimed at the dismemberment of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Member State of the\nOrganization. It profoundly deplores the inertia of the\ninternational community and the inability of the United\nNations to ensure proper compliance with and\nimplementation of the principles enshrined in the Charter\nand in international law, those principles which have been\nrepeatedly recalled in resolutions, often adopted under\nChapter VII, by the Security Council.\nSomalia has recently experienced a cruel and\ndestructive civil war which led to a dreadful famine that\ndecimated tens of thousands of its people. A multilateral\nhumanitarian rescue operation was launched with the aim of\npromoting national reconciliation and restoring the rule of\nlaw and the good functioning of government institutions.\nMorocco was one of the first countries to show its\nactive solidarity with that sisterly African country in the\nframework of a multilateral humanitarian mission. My\ncountry sent an important military contingent to alleviate the\nsuffering of the Somali people. In this context, Morocco\nvolunteered to set up a complete military hospital in which\nmore than 100,000 patients have received treatment.\nUnfortunately, we have recently seen the situation in\nSomalia change as a result of deadly confrontations that\nhave claimed numerous lives. While deploring these tragic\ndevelopments and condemning these reprehensible acts, we\nremain convinced that the solution to the Somali crisis\nhinges on continued negotiation and dialogue between all the\nparties, with the assistance of the United Nations, in order to\nachieve a genuine national reconciliation that would ensure\npeace, security and prosperity for our brethren in Somalia.\nAngola remains in the grip of a destructive civil war\ndespite the peace agreement between the Government of\nAngola and the National Union for the Total Independence\nof Angola (UNITA), which agreement was supported by the\ninternational community and the United Nations\nOrganization. Inspired by its solidarity with the Angolan\npeople, and determined to promote peace and security in this\npart of Africa, the Kingdom of Morocco, on several\noccasions has assisted the two parties in resolving\noutstanding problems through dialogue and negotiation. As\na member of the Security Council, Morocco has voted in\nfavour of all resolutions on this issue in the hope that the\ntwo parties would implement the Abidjan protocol, prepared\nwith the help of the United States of America, the Russian\nFederation and Portugal, so that an end could be put to the\ncycle of war and destruction, and thus allow Angola to usher\nin an era of peace, security and stability.\nIn South Africa, the cycle of violence continues to\nclaim innocent victims. This must not slow down or side-\ntrack the democratic process or the current efforts aimed at\ntransforming South Africa into a democratic, united and non-\nracial State. It is a source of satisfaction that the process of\nconstitutional reform is proceeding despite the bloody acts\nof provocation perpetrated by extremists from various sides.\nMorocco, which has always encouraged dialogue\nbetween the parties concerned, wants to express its\nsatisfaction at the establishment of a transitional Executive\nCouncil. We are hopeful that the parties will continue the\ndialogue and the process of reconciliation.\nMoreover, Morocco supports the appeal of Mr. Nelson\nMandela, made before the Special Committee against\nApartheid on 24 September 1993, for the lifting of the\neconomic sanctions against South Africa. We are convinced\nthat such an action will result in alleviating the economic\nburdens borne by the people of South Africa and will thus\ncontribute to resolving their internal and external problems\nand give new momentum to the settlement process.\nTwo weeks ago, the Middle East entered a new era as\na result of the mutual recognition between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel, and the signing of an\nagreement allowing for a regime of self-rule, initially in the\nGaza Strip and Jericho.\nThose two historic events have had a great impact on\nthe situation in the Middle East, as this is the first time that\nthe Palestinian and the Israeli sides have officially and\npublicly expressed their willingness to coexist and to\nrecognize one another.\nDespite the strong impact of those two events, Morocco\nbelieves that the path to a genuine, comprehensive settlement\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict is still long and that patience and\nperseverance are required in order to circumvent the many\nobstacles and difficulties that beset the process.\nThis first decisive step should be strengthened and\nshould be accompanied by a good measure of progress in the\nother bilateral negotiations. A real solution in the Middle\nEast can be achieved only if the momentum for peace is\nallowed to run its full course and reach its goal with the\nconsent of all the peoples of the region.\nTo shoulder these responsibilities at this crucial and\nhistorical juncture, it is necessary to mobilize all efforts and\nto bring together all people of goodwill in order to achieve\na just and comprehensive settlement that would be\nacceptable to all parties. Such a settlement should restore to\nthe Palestinian people their rights, including their right to an\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 23\nindependent State on their soil with Jerusalem as its capital.\nIt should also ensure the withdrawal of Israel from the other\noccupied Arab territories in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, in\nconformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973) and 425 (1978).\nOnly then can the Middle East, afflicted by war,\nviolence and tragedies for more than half a century, enter\nupon an era of peace, security, disarmament, stability and\ncooperation between all the States of the region; this would\nbring about development, welfare and prosperity.\nIn the Maghreb subregion, the Kingdom of Morocco\nfirmly believes in the principles that formed the foundation\nof the Arab Maghreb Union; we adhere to the goals of the\nUnion. We are firmly convinced that the future of the\nregion and the prosperity of its peoples, linked as they are\nby history, language, religion and a common destiny, depend\non the achievement of that unity.\nThe Arab Maghreb Union has recently encountered\nsome difficulties and obstacles. This, in our view, is only\nnatural. However, we are determined to overcome such\ndifficulties and to go forward in order to fulfil the ambition\nof the Maghreb people to build an effective structure of\ncooperation and solidarity for themselves.\nIn the area of relations with the rest of the international\ncommunity, Morocco and the other members of the Arab\nMaghreb Union view with special importance their relations\nwith countries of the European Community on the one hand,\nand with its member States on an individual or\nMediterranean basis on the other. The results achieved\nwithin the framework of dialogue and cooperation among\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean are encouraging. We\nhope therefore that the current difficulties, which have\nprevented the resumption of that dialogue, will be overcome\nsoon in order to promote a balanced regional cooperation\nbetween the northern and southern flanks of the Western\nMediterranean.\nWith regard to the so-called question of the Western\nSahara, the Settlement Plan is being implemented, and the\nSecretary-General continues to bring all new developments\nto the attention of the Security Council. The Kingdom of\nMorocco, which has always cooperated with the Secretary-\nGeneral and striven to facilitate his mission, has given its\nconsent in principle to the compromise he proposed in the\ninterpretation and application of the criteria for voter\neligibility. We are confident that the Secretary-General will\nnot fail to inform the Security Council of Morocco\u2019s sincere\nand loyal cooperation and our constant readiness to\nimplement the provisions of resolution 809 (1993) in all its\naspects. It was in the same spirit of cooperation and\nreconciliation that Morocco agreed to the Laayoune meeting\nof last July where Sahrawis, in particular, from within the\nterritory and from the region of Tindouf, took part and\ninitiated a brotherly and positive dialogue.\nA close examination of conditions prevailing in the\nworld as we stand on the threshold of the next century\nwould clearly show that the strivings of humanity in the\nareas of world peace, justice and welfare fall short of the\nhopes it set out to realize and that the challenges in the way\nof meeting those goals are still difficult and numerous.\nWhat is most needed now is a new code of conduct for\ninternational relations, a code that would take into account\nthe concerns of all peoples and countries of the world,\nrestore balance to international dealings and bring the\nprinciples of justice and partnership to the management\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nof world affairs. We hold the view that the United Nations\nis the most suitable forum for discussions on this issue and\nfor attaining our common goals.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by\ncongratulating Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\nhigh office of the presidency of the General Assembly. He\ncan rest assured that the delegation of Finland will render\nhim its full support in his challenging task.\nOn behalf of my Government, I also wish to\ncongratulate and extend a warm welcome to the new\nMembers among us. Their participation in the work of the\nUnited Nations will further strengthen the Organization.\nJust a few years ago, in a promisingly changing\npolitical environment, high hopes were placed in the United\nNations. Some of these hopes were fulfilled, others were\nnot. Namibia\u2019s independence process is a fine example of\nnation-building in which the United Nations played a crucial\nrole. Eritrea is another. Let these be examples of wise and\npatient conciliation and conflict management. Yet another\nexample is South Africa, where today we see irrevocable\nchanges taking place, leading towards a non-racial and\ndemocratic society. I wish to express my Government\u2019s\nadmiration for the achievements of the parties in South\nAfrica in their work for peace, cooperation and mutual\nrespect. Finland has actively supported the shaping of a new\nSouth Africa and will continue to do so.\nWe have in recent days witnessed yet another example\nof brave and visionary leadership which can overcome\nseemingly insuperable obstacles and lead peoples from a\nstate of war and hatred towards reconciliation. I am\nreferring to the peace accord between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization. In this context I wish to\npay a tribute to the Government of Norway for its role in\nbringing the two parties together. The United Nations must\nnow stand ready to play its part in this important endeavour\nfor peace. Finland, together with the other Nordic countries,\nwas among the first to initiate an international support\nprogramme for this historic process.\nThe United Nations also has to its credit other\nachievements in recent years. Among the most important\nhave been the rebuttal of the aggression against Kuwait and\nthe restoration of democracy in Cambodia. However,\nnumerous other conflicts have proved very difficult to solve.\nWar is raging in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia,\nAngola, Abkhazia and Nagorny-Karabakh. Conflicts persist\nin Western Sahara and Cyprus. All these conflicts constitute\nformidable challenges to the international community and to\nthe United Nations.\nFrom that balance sheet of success and failure an\nimportant question emerges: how can our Organization be\nbest adapted, reformed and revitalized to face effectively not\nonly the challenges of today but also those of tomorrow?\nUndoubtedly the United Nations is today a more viable\ninstitution than ever before. Nevertheless the many unsolved\nconflicts illustrate that the United Nations still has serious\nshortcomings. These stem primarily from the nature of the\nproblems and challenges of the increasingly interdependent\nglobal society in which we live.\nIt is now our responsibility to launch a process of\nreform of the United Nations. It must cover all of the\nOrganization\u2019s agencies, programmes and funds, in both the\npolitical and the development fields. It must be undertaken\nin an integrated manner, with a view to better adapting our\ninstruments of cooperation to the needs of a profoundly\nchanging world.\nMany crises seem political in nature but have their\nroots in social injustices and a lack of economic\nopportunities. The fulfilment of social needs and the\npromotion of economic development are necessary elements\nof sustained political stability. Some significant\nimprovements have been made in this field, too, but their\nscope and importance are clearly dwarfed by the immensity\nof the challenges. Human development, human rights and\nthe environment are cases in point.\nThanks to the dynamic initiatives of our\nSecretary-General, a process of reform of the United Nations\nis under way. In addition, several Member States have\nintroduced important proposals for reforming and\nrestructuring our Organization. My own country, together\nwith other Nordic countries, has actively participated in this\nprocess, particularly as regards peace-keeping and reform of\nthe United Nations work in the economic and social sector\nand in the area of humanitarian assistance.\nWorld events have forced the United Nations and its\nMember States to re-examine closely the Organization\u2019s\ncapacity to maintain international peace and security. The\nCharter provisions as well as the structures and machinery\ncreated for this purpose reflect a world that was very\ndifferent from the one we live in today. That is, of course,\nthe reason for the great attention that has been accorded over\nthe past year or two to what traditionally has been called\npeace-keeping. The concept of peace-keeping is, as a result\nof increasingly complex operations, going through a period\nof evolution. Related activities such as preventive\ndiplomacy, peacemaking and peace-building are the new\ntools for maintaining international peace and security.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 27\nThe United Nations and its Member States must adjust\nto the rapid growth in and new approaches to peace- keeping\noperations. The President of the Security Council in his\nstatement of May this year outlined the operational principles\nin accordance with which such operations should be\nconducted. My Government fully subscribes to these\nprinciples.\nThe great increase in requests for peace-keeping troops,\nmilitary observers and monitors makes it necessary, in my\nGovernment\u2019s view, for the United Nations to adopt stricter\nand clearer criteria and procedures before launching such\noperations. The United Nations must not overextend itself;\nit cannot be present everywhere.\nMandates for peace-keeping operations must be precise\nand clear. The necessary funding must be secured, and\nbefore launching any operations the Security Council must\nsee to it that the required contingents are available. Recent\nexperiences also prove that command structures must be\nclearly spelled out and subsequently fully adhered too. It is\nnot sufficient for the Security Council to agree on\nresolutions setting up new operations; all the conditions for\ntheir implementation must also be at hand.\nWe also face new challenges in disarmament and arms\ncontrol. The nuclear arms race has stopped, but nuclear\nproliferation still constitutes a serious potential threat to\ninternational security and stability. It is vital to ensure that\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty regime works efficiently. In\ngeneral, disarmament and arms regulation should be\nintegrated into the broader agenda of international peace and\nsecurity. This should be reflected both in the United Nations\ndisarmament machinery and in the Geneva Conference on\nDisarmament. The review of the composition of the\nConference on Disarmament would enhance this objective.\nWe regret that no agreement on this issue has been reached\nso far.\nThe Security Council is vested with the primary\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. In carrying out its duties, the Council acts on\nbehalf of the entire membership of the United Nations.\nTrust and confidence in the Council by all Member States is\ntherefore a crucial factor, affecting its ability to engage in\nconflict resolution. It is only natural that a review be\nundertaken of the composition of the Security Council in\norder to make the Council better reflect today\u2019s membership\nas well as the prevailing political realities.\nMy Government has an open mind on this question.\nWe are ready to accept a limited increase in the membership\nof the Council, provided that such a change will not affect\nnegatively the capacity of the Council to perform its tasks.\nMoreover, there would seem to be a need to review the\nCouncil\u2019s organization and methods of work. The aim\nshould be to increase transparency and to provide\nnon-members better opportunities to be heard when matters\nof immediate concern to them are considered by the Council.\nIt would seem desirable - especially in negotiating the\nmandates and the financing of peace-keeping operations - to\ninvolve to a greater extent non-members of the Council also,\nas provided for by the Charter. Such involvement would be\nparticularly called for in the case of those States that are\npotential contributors of troops and logistical support.\nWork on revitalizing the General Assembly and\nrationalizing its activities is also under way. Certain\nimprovements have already been introduced. However,\nfurther efforts have to be made to ensure a more meaningful\nand responsible role for the Assembly. To enhance the\nAssembly\u2019s standing and add weight to its resolutions it is,\nin our view, necessary to establish clear priorities. It is\nimportant to focus the work in the Assembly on these\npriorities and to reduce the number of items on its agenda.\nIndeed, time has come to consider even some radical\nmethods to enhance the effectiveness of the Assembly. One\nmight ask whether a full-fledged General Assembly session\nevery year is really necessary and productive. Alternatively,\na high-level political debate and meetings of the Main\nCommittees might be held every other year. Moreover, the\nPresident and the Bureau of a session of the General\nAssembly could perhaps be designated well before the end\nof the preceding session. That would permit the officers of\nthe General Assembly and the Secretariat better to prepare\nthe work of the General Assembly. These and other ideas\nmerit further consideration.\nThe economic and social sectors of the United Nations,\nincluding the Economic and Social Council itself, are other\nareas where reforms are being actively discussed. The\nNordic countries initiated a reform of the operational\nactivities for development. Although there is virtual\nagreement on a number of reform issues, there are still\ndetails to be settled concerning the governance and financing\nof the development agencies of the United Nations. I hope\nthat these much needed reforms can be agreed upon by the\nend of November so that the new structures can be put in\nplace as early as 1994.\nDuring the discussions on the ongoing reforms it has\nbecome obvious that the extraordinary extent and rapidity of\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\neconomic and social change, as well as the challenges of the\nglobal environment, necessitate reforms that are even much\nmore profound. We must now devote our efforts to a\nreorientation of the United Nations system in this new and\ndaunting environment. We should, in particular, clarify our\nthinking about the institutional and structural linkages\nbetween work on peace and security and work on sustainable\ndevelopment. Likewise, we should establish the true\npriorities in the economic and social sectors as well as in the\nUnited Nations system\u2019s relations with other international\norganizations. Such rethinking and reform cannot be carried\nout during one single session of the General Assembly. It\nwill take a sustained effort over several years, which, in turn,\npresupposes a consensus on the basic outlines of a reform\nprogramme.\nThe shaping of a consensus is our primary task. The\nagenda for development which the Secretary-General will\npresent will no doubt have a catalytic effect in this respect,\nas could the upcoming important conferences on population,\nsocial development and gender issues. The fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations will, in my view, provide\na suitable occasion for launching such an ambitious,\nfundamental and visionary reform programme.\nIn order for the United Nations to function effectively\nit must have a solid executive branch, a Secretariat that has\nat its disposal sufficient human and financial resources. The\nSecretary-General has taken several steps to streamline the\nSecretariat and make it a more efficient tool for\nimplementing the decisions of the Member States. But more\nneeds to be done in order to permit the Secretariat to take\ninitiatives and pursue its intellectual leadership role.\nAt a time when resources are scarce and so many new\ntasks have been entrusted to the United Nations, it is clear\nthat a pruning of activities and rationalization of working\nmethods must be done. The cutting of unnecessary and\nobsolete programmes must continue. It is the task of the\nMember States to give guidance to the Secretary-General,\nbut also to draw conclusions and take the necessary\ndecisions. The United Nations should apply the same policy\nof austerity as national Governments in the prevailing\neconomic circumstances.\nPerhaps the greatest concern for the United Nations\ntoday is the unwillingness of the great majority of Member\nStates to pay their assessed contributions. My delegation has\nsaid time and again, and I will repeat it now: Payment of\none\u2019s dues is not an option. It is an obligation falling on\nevery Member, big or small. Let it be our collective\nbirthday present to the United Nations at the fiftieth\nanniversary to see to it that by then there is full compliance\nwith the obligation concerning payment of contributions.\nMember States, in fulfilling their financial obligations\ntowards the United Nations, have the right to expect full\naccountability for the resources placed at the disposal of the\nOrganization. It is essential that the Organization exercise\nprudent economic management and constantly improve the\ninternal control system. We therefore believe that ideas such\nas the creation of the post of an independent inspector\ngeneral are well worth considering. The main objective\nmust now be to restore the confidence of the Member States\nand the general public in our Organization. The United\nNations cannot afford to have its public image and integrity\ntarnished by allegations of mismanagement.\nAs the United Nations approaches its fiftieth\nanniversary, humanity is faced with formidable challenges.\nMeeting them will not be easy. And yet, the United Nations\nnow has a better chance than ever to use its full potential\nand show leadership for the sake of a better future. \\\"We the\npeoples of the United Nations, ... united for a better world\\\"\nhas been chosen as the theme for the celebration of our\nfiftieth anniversary. Let us all together join in making this\na reality.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with pleasure that I convey to Your Excellency at the\noutset of my statement, our sincerest congratulations on your\nelection to the Presidency of the forty-eighth session of the\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. Your election\nreflects appreciation for you personally, as well as for the\npositive role played by your country in the international\narena. I wish you every success in the pursuit of your\nmission.\nOn this occasion, I also wish to congratulate your\npredecessor for his effective guidance of the affairs of the\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session.\nI also wish to acknowledge the sincere efforts\nconstantly exerted by the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to enhance the\nprospects for peace and reduce the elements of tension\nwhich prevail in many parts of the world.\nI am also pleased to welcome, on behalf of the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, all the States that have joined our\nOrganization to participate, along with all other Member\nStates, in realizing the noble objectives towards which we all\nstrive.\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place\namidst important developments in the international arena that\nrequire us to strive to conclude our work with successful\nresolutions on the problems and crises we face. These\nresolutions must be within the context of our efforts to\nbenefit from the opportunities provided by the emergence of\nwhat has come to be known as the new international order.\nWe have all contributed, through the United Nations to\nestablishing the new international order, the foundations of\nwhich are based on the principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter and inherent in international law. This new\norder respects the sovereignty and independence of States\nand guarantees the inviolability of their international borders.\nIt guarantees the territorial integrity of States and rejects\ninterference in their domestic affairs. It is based on equity\namong nations, small and large, rich and poor, and its goal\nis to replace war and destruction with cooperation between\nnations and peoples. The new international order strives for\nthe peaceful resolution of conflict and rejects the use of\nforce or coercion. It operates to preserve the dignity of man\nand to spread security, stability, prosperity and development\nto all corners of our world.\nThe emergence of this new order has been a source of\nhope and optimism for the international community,\nparticularly when serious and constructive international\ncooperation succeeded in confronting the Iraqi aggression\nagainst the State of Kuwait. Today, however, we are\nsaddened and pained by the inability of this order to confront\nthe aggression committed against the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, a State Member of our international\nOrganization. This crisis, if not resolved in a manner\ncompatible with the principles of the new world order, will\ncause this new order to lose its credibility and effectiveness.\nWe therefore call for enhancing the role of the United\nNations from one of mere crisis management and\nmaintenance of peace to one of active and effective\npeacemaking.\nA general overview of the current international situation\nreveals that there remain pockets of tension which threaten\nsecurity and stability in many regions of the world. With\nthe persistence of such challenges, the role of the United\nNations is becoming increasingly important, not only for the\nmaintenance of peace, but as an effective means for creating\nconditions conducive to peace and stability throughout the\nworld. Without a doubt, the creation of such conditions will\nbe made much easier if the opportunities for cooperation\nbetween nations are increased and support for the United\nNations is strengthened so that the Organization may\nfunction in a manner that would guarantee that no country\ncommits aggression against another or threatens its security,\nsovereignty or territorial integrity.\nThe honourable role played by the United Nations more\nthan three years ago when it stood firmly in the face of\nIraq\u2019s aggression against its neighbour Kuwait, and the\nresolutions it adopted led in the end to repelling aggression\nand restoring legality to Kuwait the peace-loving nation.\nThis positive role portrays our expectations of this\ninternational body in the present circumstances. We hope\nthat it will continue to be played and ask that it be enhanced\nby efforts to ensure the complete implementation of all\nSecurity Council resolutions regarding the Iraqi regime,\nwhich continues to flout international legality. Two years\nafter the liberation of Kuwait, the Baghdad regime continues\nto resort to threats and false allegations against Kuwait. It\ncontinues to delay efforts to implement United Nations\nresolutions and rejects all international obligations. We\npoint in particular to the Iraqi regime\u2019s objections to the\nrecommendations of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\nBoundary Demarcation Commission and its rejection of\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993), as well as its\ncontinued detention of Kuwaiti hostages and prisoners of\nwar. This regime has arrogated the right, on the basis of\nsovereignty, to starve and abuse its people and subject Iraq\nto dangers which threaten its unity and security. It falsely\nblames the international community for the dangers and\ntragedies to which Iraq and its people have become subject.\nThe surest way of facing up to the threats this regime poses\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 19\nto the region as a whole, and to the Iraqi people is to fully\nand completely implement Security Council resolutions.\nThe Declaration of Principles between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and the Israeli Government, signed\nin Washington, D.C. on 13 September 1993, has raised\nexpectations and hopes that a just and permanent settlement\ncan be found to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has persisted\nfor far too long. This development, though representing\nonly an agreement on autonomy in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories, beginning with Gaza and Jericho, nevertheless\nrepresents a step towards the establishment of a just,\ncomprehensive and permanent peace between the Arab\nStates and Israel. A solution to the Palestinian question will\nobviously contribute to a just and comprehensive settlement\nof the Arab-Israeli conflict as it is the core issue of that\nconflict.\nThe warm welcome with which the Palestinian-Israeli\nagreement was received within Palestinian, Arab and\ninternational circles genuinely and clearly reflects the desire\nof the Arabs to establish a permanent, just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. It also indicates\nthe seriousness with which the Arab side has pursued the\ncurrent peace process, which was launched in Madrid in\nOctober 1991 under the sponsorship of the United States of\nAmerica and the Russian Federation.\nAs we witness today the optimism generated by the\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement, we cannot but feel that it is\nincumbent upon the international community to lend support\nto the progress that has been achieved in this area by\nproviding the necessary economic and developmental\nassistance required to build the administrative structures\nneeded to make the agreement on self-rule succeed. At the\nsame time, it is also incumbent upon us to work diligently\nto exploit the momentum generated by this agreement in\nfurthering the cause of peace.\nThe consolidation of this step requires the achievement\nof tangible and positive results in the areas of negotiation\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis; at the forefront of those\nare the issue of Al-Quds, which is an integral part of the\noccupied Arab territories, the issue of the return of\nPalestinian refugees, and the settlements built by Israel in the\noccupied Arab territories contrary to international law and\nthe Geneva Conventions. At the same time, genuine\nprogress along all the other bilateral negotiating tracks is\nneeded.\nThe issue of the occupied Arab Syrian Golan Heights\nis clear: it is governed by the principle of respect for\ninternational borders. The maintenance of security is not\nfeasible, as the realities of contemporary history teach us,\nthrough the occupation of territory by force, but rather\nthrough the establishment of peace. Thus, peace on this\nfront will be achieved only by a complete Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the occupied Golan Heights.\nLikewise, the Lebanese-Israeli negotiating track is\ngoverned by United Nations Security Council resolution\n425 (1978), which clearly calls for the immediate,\nunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese\nterritory.\nI wish to express the appreciation of the Government of\nthe Custodian of the two holy mosques to President Clinton\nfor his prudent initiative in calling for, and hosting, an\ninternational donors\u2019 conference to solicit political and\nfinancial support for the Palestinians as they prepare to\nassume the responsibilities of self-rule in the occupied\nterritories. I also wish to take this opportunity to express\nour pleasure at the positive results achieved at that\nconference.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given, and continues\nto give, its full support in all possible forms to the Middle\nEast peace process since it began in Madrid. It has\nparticipated effectively in the multilateral talks, and\ngenuinely hopes that the process will lead to a just,\npermanent and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian\nquestion and the Arab conflict with Israel on the basis of\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973).\nDespite the financial burdens the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia bears in building an advanced economy in which the\nexpectations of its citizens for a better future are fulfilled,\nand despite its current international obligations at a time of\ndifficulty in the international economic system, the Kingdom\nof Saudi Arabia participated in the international donors\u2019\nconference that recently concluded its meetings in\nWashington.\nThe Custodian of the two holy mosques has bestowed\nupon me the honour of announcing the Kingdom\u2019s\ncommitment to providing substantial developmental\nassistance to improve the infrastructures in the West Bank\nand Gaza Strip in coordination and cooperation with the\nWorld Bank\u2019s special five-year programme for the occupied\nterritories. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will participate,\nthrough the Saudi development fund, to the tune of\n$100 million for the year 1994. We believe that this\nassistance will improve the living conditions of our\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nPalestinian brethren in the occupied Arab territories and\ncontribute positively to the peace process.\nThe Lebanese Government has made great strides in its\nefforts to implement the Taif Accords, and has taken the\nnecessary political and constitutional measures to achieve\nthis aim. We must continue our support for the efforts of\nthe legitimate Lebanese authorities and contribute to the\nprocess of reconstruction in Lebanon.\nIn this regard, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appeals to\nthe international community to help Lebanon by all available\nmeans in order to enable its Government to continue moving\nforward with the process of reconstruction and allow\nLebanon to regain its material and cultural position.\nIt is important to reiterate the need, if this goal is to be\nachieved, for an Israeli commitment to implement, fully and\nunconditionally, United Nations Security Council resolution\n425 (1978), which requires Israel to withdraw from Lebanese\nterritory to enable the Lebanese Government to extend its\nlegal authority over all Lebanon.\nWe should like to emphasize our desire for the Middle\nEast region to obtain its legitimate share of security, peace\nand stability so that it is able to direct all its energies\ntowards development and devote all its resources towards\nprosperity for its people.\nOne of the most important tasks facing us in this\nrespect is to strive towards the elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction in the Middle East. The Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia is a signatory to the Convention on the\nnon-proliferation of chemical weapons and the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We continue to\nbelieve that the goal of making the Middle East a region free\nof all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, whether\nnuclear, chemical or biological, will be realized only when\nall States in the region, including Israel, refrain from the\nproduction, stockpiling, or possession of any kind of weapon\nof mass destruction.\nThe situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina is being aggravated by the continuation of a\ngenocidal war waged by Serb forces, with the support of\nSerbia and Montenegro, against that young Republic. The\ncontinuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwhich has resulted in the death of thousands of innocent\ncivilians and the displacement of a large portion of its\ncitizens, would not have occurred were it not for the\napparent indifference of the international community. This\nattitude allowed the forces of aggression to benefit from\ntheir aggression, and to continue their abhorrent policy of\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" without fear of retribution.\nThis feeble stand on the part the international\ncommunity, particularly the European countries, was\nreflected in the inability to implement comprehensively the\nresolutions of the London Conference, upon which we had\nrested great hopes. It is also reflected in the failure of the\nVance-Owen plan and the collapse of the subsequent Geneva\ntalks on refugees.\nThe international community\u2019s dereliction of its\nresponsibilities vis-\u00e1-vis the Serb aggression has emboldened\nthe Croats to embark upon a similar course of making gains\nby means of force and coercion.\nAgainst such a backdrop, it was strange indeed that\nwhen Croatia was targeted by Serbian aggression, the\ninternational community, and especially the European\nnations, were quick to stand by Croatia and provide military\nassistance that contributed to the success of international\nefforts to achieve a peaceful settlement, whereas the\ninternational community\u2019s feeble stance in the case of\nBosnia and Herzegovina and its failure to implement the\ninternational resolutions calling for the imposition of\neconomic sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, have\ndeprived that young Republic of the means of exercising its\nlegitimate right to self-defence. Those resolutions and the\nsanctions they call for remained dead letter and were not\nseriously implemented until it was too late, after the Serbs\nhad rejected the Vance-Owen Plan, which the Bosnians and\nCroats had accepted. What really shocks and amazes us is\nthat this war of aggression is being waged on the European\nsoil whereas history teaches us that such wars on that soil\nhave never been limited wars but have always overspilled\nbeyond the borders. However, no one seems to be paying\nany attention to those object-lessons.\nWhile we hope that the history of Europe\u2019s wars will\nnot repeat itself, we hope that the solutions that are being\nproposed do not turn out to be the seeds of future conflicts\nand disputes. We hope that the international community will\ngive serious consideration to the demands of the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina so that it may be saved from any\nrepetition of the policies of aggression and \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\". The geographical demands of that young nation\nshould be satisfied by granting it access to the sea as well as\nproviding it with the means of legitimate self-defence, in\nconsonance with the principles of the United Nations\nCharter.\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 21\nThe principled stand by the people and Government of\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of the Republic of\nBosnia and Herzegovina emanates from their strong and total\nadherence to international legality and respect for\ninternational law and not from any religious fanaticism or\nethnic affinity. It is the same principled stand that was taken\nby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in support of Kuwait when\nit fell victim to the Iraqi regime\u2019s aggression.\nSomalia continues to be in the grip of instability and\npolitical chaos, with all the attendant acts of violence and\nbloodshed, despite all the efforts deployed to help that nation\nout of its plight. International efforts, during the Conference\nfor National Reconciliation held at Addis Ababa, focused on\nthe preservation of the Somali State and the maintenance of\nits independence and territorial integrity. Unfortunately, the\nrequired steps have not been taken for the serious\nimplementation of that Agreement. The role of the United\nNations has been limited to the distribution of humanitarian\nassistance to those in need at a time when the role it is\nexpected to play within the new world order is to contribute\nto peacemaking and to the stabilization of the Somali State.\nSuch measures should help to establish a Somali\nGovernment that can extend its authority throughout\nSomalia.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a number of\nattempts to contain the conflict in Somalia and has tried to\nbring about national reconciliation among the various\nfactions. It will continue to deploy efforts to stop the\nbloodshed and to provide humanitarian assistance and relief.\nWe support the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations in his\nreport to the Security Council, on the means of helping re-\nestablish Somalia\u2019s constitutional institutions and on the\nefforts needed to reach national reconciliation and to rebuild\nSomalia.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stood by the fraternal\npeople of Afghanistan throughout their jihad and celebrated\nwith them their victory over the forces of brutal occupation\nin the struggle for restoring their national identity. The\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia spared no effort in working for\nreconciliation when the infighting started between the\nvarious mujahidin factions. Those efforts were crowned\nwith the signing of the Mecca Agreement and the initiation\nof steps towards its implementation. A National\nGovernment that combined all factions of the Afghan\nmujahidin was established. We take this opportunity to urge\nour brethren in Afghanistan to comply with the terms of the\nagreement so that Afghanistan may begin to move towards\nreconstruction and development and regain its place and role\nin the international community.\nIt must be noted that that part of the world continues to\nsuffer as a result of the problem of Jammu and Kashmir,\nwhich continues to be an element of instability in the region.\nThe Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\nfollows with great concern the ongoing violence there. We\nare keen on finding a solution on the basis of United Nations\nresolutions to this long-standing problem that has\novershadowed the relations of the two neighbours, India and\nPakistan.\nAmong the other conflicts in Asia I would refer to the\ntragic developments resulting from the worsening conflict\nbetween two United Nations Member States, the Republic of\nAzerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia. That conflict has\nrecently resulted in the occupation by Armenia of parts of\nAzerbaijan. We consider that occupation to be a breach of\nthe principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and\nemphasize the importance of withdrawal by Armenia\u2019s\nforces from Azerbaijan\u2019s territory in order to transfer that\nissue to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a\npeaceful and just settlement that would ensure the legitimate\nrights of the people of Azerbaijan.\nOur joint and serious efforts towards consolidating the\nunderpinnings of the new world order aim at making it\npossible to address the issues of development and the\ncreation of an international economic environment in which\nfinancial resources would be diverted from arms races to\neconomic and social development. Those efforts are in\nkeeping with our ambitions and the aspirations of our\npeoples for a better world of peace, prosperity and security.\nSuch an enterprise requires the cooperation of the developed\nindustrial nations by opening their markets to the products\nof the developing nations, the elimination of protectionist\nmeasures, ensuring an early successful outcome to the\nUruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and finding an\nurgent, rapid solution to the debt problem. On the other\nhand, economic cooperation between the developing\ncountries themselves is a paramount issue and represents a\nfundamental tool for consolidating international economic\ngrowth.\nMy Government attaches great importance to issues\nrelating to the world economic system. The Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia represents a State open to the world,\ninteracting with all the trends and developments that affect\nit. Thus, we are keen on preserving the health and strength\nof the world economy, and we are concerned by the\ndisruptions and turmoil that affect its course and\ndevelopment. It is on that basis that the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia is participating positively in the ongoing discussions\non energy and environment. We have shouldered our\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nresponsibilities in this regard and have played an active role\nin international discussions to find a workable and balanced\nsolution to global warming based on proven scientific\nevidence. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that\nthe future of this world, its prosperity, and the well-being of\nits inhabitants, depend on a clear understanding of the\nenvironmental problems that face us all and on fully\nunderstanding the consequences of the policies adopted in\ndealing with those problems.\nThis requires delicate balancing of the burdens and\ncommitments of each and every State in addressing problems\nof the environment. Due consideration should be given also\nto the situation of every energy producing or consumer\ndeveloping country and the effects of environmental policies\non the economic growth of those countries. Such an\napproach will certainly contribute to the achievement of\ncomprehensive development and to the betterment of our\npeoples\u2019 standards of living so that they may all enjoy\nprosperity, peace, security and stability. The current\ninternational circumstances, resulting from the ending of the\ncold war, together with the progress achieved in arms control\nand reductions of conventional weapons afford us a rare\nopportunity for channelling the financial windfall towards\nsolving the problems of development and economic\nbackwardness.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront\nof Islamic States that have adhered to the Cairo Declaration\non Human Rights in Islam, issued by the Organization of the\nIslamic Conference on 5 August 1990. This Cairo\nDeclaration should be regarded as a tributary providing the\nproper foundation for positive and practical international\ncooperation and flowing into the main stream of universal\nsupport for human rights and freedoms.\nMost particularly, the Declaration expresses the will of\nover 1 billion people, which by any measure grants it a\nuniversal character. While the principles and objectives of\nhuman rights are universal in nature, their application must\ntake into consideration the diversity of societies and their\nhistorical, cultural, and religious backgrounds and legal\nsystems. We should not rush to the creation of mechanisms\nthat would only deepen differences and disregard the sort of\nsensitivities that became noticeable during the World\nConference on Human Rights that was held recently in\nVienna.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a developing society\nfirmly based on the rules that constitute the pillars of Islamic\ncivilization. It is a society that has firmly set itself to face\nup to the challenges of our times with determination and\nconfidence, and it is a society undergoing evolution and\nsignificant reform. Its reforms are guided by the Custodian\nof the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aiz, and\nembodied in the basic laws of governance, the Charter of the\nMajlis al-Shura - the consultative council - and the laws of\nthe provinces. These laws place upon the State the primary\nresponsibility for the protection of human rights in\naccordance with the Islamic Shariah and determine the\nrelationship between ruler and ruled on the basis of\nbrotherhood, consultation, loyalty and cooperation.\nI am pleased to inform this body that the members of\nthe Majlis al-Shura and those of the provincial councils have\nbeen named. These institutions are now making serious\npreparations to embark upon their appointed tasks and to\nserve their faith, their King, and their nation. This important\nstep in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s development paves\nthe way for participation by Saudi citizens in sharing the\nresponsibility for confidently building a promising and\nhopeful future.\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 23\nThe political and economic challenges we face which\nabound on this session\u2019s agenda, put a great burden of\nresponsibility on us all towards our peoples and nations.\nOur common future will depend on the way we face up to\nthose challenges. In the light of the current international\nsituation and of the emergence of a new international\noutlook which rejects fanaticism and ossification and\nconfirms a desire for openness and progress, we harbour\ngreat hopes that we shall be able to surmount those\nchallenges. In so doing, we must take into consideration the\nfact that the new international order will not be able to\nprovide us with the peace, justice and development we desire\nunless we give it the opportunity to do just that.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first of all, Sir, to associate myself with\nthe congratulations already extended to you on your election\nto the high office of President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session and to wish you every success in your\nendeavours.\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\nKazakhstan, I should like to convey deep sympathy to the\nGovernment and the people of the friendly country of India\nfor the heavy death toll and considerable material loss\ncaused by the devastating earthquake on 30 September.\nThe international realities that form the background of\nthe current session are a direct reflection of the development\nof extremely contradictory tendencies within the world\ncommunity. On the one hand, during the year gone by since\nthe beginning of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly we have witnessed a dynamic development of\ninternational relations along with increased United Nations\nactivity in the resolution of global economic, social and\nenvironmental issues and in the promotion of peace and\nsecurity. The achievement of agreement on the Middle East\nproblem should undoubtedly be counted as a breakthrough\nin multilateral diplomacy, but, on the other hand, we must\nstate with regret that no agreement has been reached so far\non the cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia, that\nthe tension in Somalia has increased and that hotbeds of\nconflicts still smoulder in a number of republics of the\nformer Soviet Union.\nWe have made a careful study of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report (A/48/1) on the work of the Organization\nand share its principal conclusion that in order to produce\nenduring results there must at all costs be a new level of\npolitical will and realism.\nThe President of the United States, Mr. Clinton, pointed\nout in his statement on 27 September that the United Nations\nsimply cannot be engaged in each and every one of the\nconflicts in the world. This goes without saying. But it is\nequally self-evident that the United Nations is today, and\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwill remain in the foreseeable future, a body to which\nhumanity - the world\u2019s nations and individuals - will link\ntheir aspirations for peace, development and human rights.\nIn these circumstances, in our opinion, a package of\nconcrete measures aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of\nthe United Nations is called for. We believe that, along with\na further definition of the functions of the United Nations\nmain organs, the elimination of duplication in their activities\nand the adequate financing of United Nations peace-keeping\noperations, it is high time to consider the question of\nexpanding the permanent membership of the Security\nCouncil. We are confident that this measure will enable the\nUnited Nations to respond more rapidly and objectively to\nthe new, dangerous challenges of the times and eruptions of\nviolence, regardless of where this might happen.\nThe harsh realities of the post-confrontation era have\nhighlighted the urgency of redirecting the efforts of the\nworld community towards eliminating the potential for\ndisputes within a State or between States to escalate into\nmilitary conflicts. Should we fail to resolve disputes at an\nearly stage, we will simply reap fruits similar to those reaped\nin the former Yugoslavia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Tajikistan.\nThis reaffirms once again the appropriateness of the idea of\npreventive diplomacy formulated by Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali in his report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". Only\nby taking a series of preventive measures based on global\nand regional cooperation between nations can peace be\nensured and maintained.\nThis is at the heart of the idea of creating a system of\ncollective security in Asia within the framework of the\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures\nin Asia (CICMA). As is known, this initiative was\nformulated comprehensively by Mr. Nazarbaev, President of\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, precisely one year ago, at the\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To promote\nthe realization of the initiative, Kazakhstan hosted two\nrounds of expert-level meetings within the framework of\npreparations for CICMA, which took place this year in\nAlmaty and yielded promising results. At present, 25 Asian\nStates are involved in the CICMA process. I take this\nopportunity to invite other States interested in strengthening\nconfidence-building measures in Asia to join our efforts. I\nbelieve that today we should actively broaden our efforts to\ndefine the problems related to this initiative. I have in mind\nparticularly the preparations for the conference of Foreign\nMinisters of Asian States which, in the view of experts,\ncould be convened in 1994.\nWe note with satisfaction that the idea of regional\ncooperation in Asia has been endorsed by the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and has found\na broad response within the United Nations, the Conference\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the League of\nArab States. This positive reaction to our initiative fills us\nwith confidence in its viability and its significance for the\ncause of peace in Asia.\nIndeed, the States of the Asian region have an equally\nstrong interest in the prevention and peaceful settlement of\nconflicts as well as in the prevention of the emergence of\nnew hotbeds of regional and global tension. As an example\nI would mention the formation of the Defence Coalition\nForces of the members of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS), which acted as a restraining factor\nin the Tajik conflict. Joint military units of Russia,\nKazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan managed to reduce\nconsiderably the scale of military confrontation, saved the\nlives of thousands of civilians and provided relief for\nhundreds of thousands of refugees. In this context, the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, along with the other\nCommonwealth States, is asking for support for our joint\nappeal to recognize the Defence Coalition Forces of the CIS\nas the United Nations peacemaking force in that region.\nAnother important aspect of close cooperation between\nAsian States is the coordination of their efforts on\nenvironmental issues. The severe environmental problems\nof Kazakhstan are well known. The first among them is the\nproblem of the Aral Sea. The critical situation in the Aral\nregion has frequently been discussed at various international\nconferences and meetings of Heads of States. As a result,\nwe now have a sizeable package of documents defining\nshort-term and strategic solutions to the problem. We point\nin particular to the signing of the Agreement on Joint\nActivities in Preserving the Aral Sea and the Environmental\nRehabilitation of the Region and the Statute of the\nInternational Fund for Preserving the Aral Sea. However,\nwe are convinced that this environmental tragedy has effects\nfar beyond the confines of the region. Today, only the\ncollective efforts of the world community can bring about a\nsolution to this problem. We therefore support the proposal\nput forward by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan,\nMr. Karimov, to set up a special United Nations forum,\nperhaps a United Nations commission on the Aral Sea.\nAnother priority in the foreign policy of our Republic\nis the strengthening of intergovernmental relations within the\nCIS. We are confident that at present no member State of\nthe Commonwealth is able effectively to pursue its internal\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17\nand foreign policy in isolation from the policies of the other\nmembers of the CIS. In this context, the President of the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nazarbaev, has repeatedly\nproposed concrete measures to consolidate the common\neconomic space and ensure social and political stability on\na collective basis.\nAt the recent meeting of the Heads of State of the CIS\nin Moscow, an economic union of the Commonwealth was\nset up for the purpose of coordinating the policies of\nmember States in various fields. This serves the interests of\nall members of the CIS.\nKazakhstan will remain active in promoting the\nintegration of the members of the CIS. We strongly believe\nthat all emerging political problems and conflict situations\nshould be resolved in constructive and civilized ways. This\nidea is the essence of two recent statements by President\nNazarbaev on the current critical situation in the Russian\nFederation.\nOur State has a diversified foreign policy, and the\nexpansion of cooperation in all fields with all countries is of\nutmost strategic importance to us. After signing the Lisbon\nProtocol of 23 May 1992, the Republic of Kazakhstan, along\nwith other States successors to the USSR, was recognized as\na party to the START I Treaty and undertook to accede to\nthe non-proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. At\npresent, negotiations are under way with a number of States\non cooperation in assisting Kazakhstan to meet its\ncommitments to eliminate strategic offensive weapons.\nIn this context, I share the opinion of my Ukrainian\ncolleague, Mr. Zlenko, about the extreme complexity of this\nproblem. In our opinion, Kazakhstan would need\nconsiderable funds for this purpose: approximately $2\nbillion - not an easy sum to find in our national budget.\nThese funds are needed not only to cover the dismantling of\nnuclear weapons, but also to eliminate the consequences of\nnuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Testing Ground and to\nsolve the Aral sea crisis as well.\nReferring to the problem of the elimination of the\nconsequences of nuclear tests at the now-closed\nSemipalatinsk Testing Ground, I should like to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to the enormous damage to the health\nof the people of a vast region wrought by 466 nuclear tests\nin all environments. In varying degrees, almost half a\nmillion Kazakh citizens have suffered the deadly effects of\nnuclear tests. It is quite understandable, therefore, that\nKazakhstan wholeheartedly supports a comprehensive and\ncomplete ban on nuclear tests.\nOne of the active areas of Kazakhstan\u2019s foreign policy\nis cooperation with the CSCE and the North Atlantic\nCooperation Council. The possibilities of Kazakhstan\u2019s\nmore regular and active participation in CSCE activities\nwere discussed in particular with the CSCE Chairman,\nMargaretha af Ugglas, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nSweden, during a visit of the CSCE delegation to Almaty\nlast June.\nBroadly speaking, our foreign policy can now be\ndescribed as dynamic and active. Kazakhstan\u2019s membership\nof the United Nations has allowed it to become actively\ninvolved in international life, a fact reflected in our\nmembership now of 20 international organizations, including\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the World\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF), and others. The Republic\u2019s\nmembership in the United Nations Industrial Development\nOrganization (UNIDO), the Economic Commission for\nEurope (ECE) and other international organizations is under\nconsideration.\nKazakhstan\u2019s internal reforms are being carried out in\naccordance with the international treaties to which it has\nacceded. In spite of major economic problems, which are\ncommon in varying degrees to the States of the former\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, a strong legal basis for\neconomic reforms has been laid down in our Republic.\nThe laws passed by the Kazakhstan Parliament are\ndesigned to develop medium- and small-scale business,\nattract and protect foreign investments and liberalize foreign\ntrade. Providing a legal basis for foreign economic activity\nenvisages a gradual decrease of export and import duties and\nthe removal of free trade barriers which had to be imposed\nduring the transition period because of the particular features\nof that time. Of course, such transformations will take more\nthan one or two years, but Kazakhstan intends to carry them\nout as soon as possible.\nKazakhstan has now begun to attract international\nbusiness. Following deals with Chevron and other major\nforeign companies, which have demonstrated to the world\nbusiness community that Kazakhstan is anxious to attract\nforeign investment on a mutually beneficial basis and ensure\na favourable environment for it, the flow of foreign\ninvestment into the Republic\u2019s economy has been growing\nsteadily, and this is raising our hopes for the ultimate\nsuccess of our reforms.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe understand clearly that now, at a time when our\nRepublic is reaching out to the world community and is\ndeclaring its willingness to join it as an equal and respected\nmember, it is of particular importance for us to affirm our\ncompliance with internationally recognized standards of\nhuman rights. The Constitution of the Republic of\nKazakhstan adopted in January 1993 recognizes, in\naccordance with international standards, the primacy of\nrights and freedoms of the individual and places the primacy\nof the interests of the individual above the interests of the\nState and society, proclaims the ideas of civil peace and\nethnic accord, and the equality of all nations and ethnic\ngroups living in the Republic. I wish to draw attention to\nthe fact that Kazakhstan is the only one of the newly formed\nStates of the former USSR where national radio and TV\nprogrammes are broadcast in six different languages,\nnewspapers and magazines are published in seven languages\nand instruction in schools is given in 18 languages.\nKazakhstan\u2019s commitment to equal rights for all ethnic\ngroups in economic and social development was clearly\nstated at the World Conference on Human Rights held in\nVienna last June. The documents adopted at that Conference\nwill undoubtedly serve as an important guarantee of the\nobservance of human rights both at the international and at\nthe national levels.\nHowever, the practical realization of human rights and\nfreedoms is a long and gradual process which depends on\nmany factors such as the level of economic and political\ndevelopment of the society, the ideological priorities, the\nnational mentality, and so on. It is therefore unjustifiable for\nsome people to assume the responsibility for setting human\nrights standards and to use their own interpretation of the\nconcept as an instrument of pressure on certain countries in\nquestions related to bilateral or multilateral relations.\nIn this context, Kazakhstan, while supporting efforts to\naffirm the universal nature of human rights, believes that it\nis necessary to take into account the specific national\nconditions of each member of the world community. The\nproblem of human rights is not only pressing but also\ndelicate, and hence it requires an extremely careful and\nbalanced approach. It is this understanding which drives the\ninternal ethnic policy of our country, a State the very\nstability of which depends upon the peaceful and mutually\nrespectful coexistence of ethnic groups.\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is the\nsecond one in which Kazakhstan has participated as a full\nMember of the United Nations. Despite such recent\nmembership in the Organization, Kazakhstan has actively\nparticipated in the promotion of international relations,\ncontributed to the strengthening of processes of integration,\nand has offered its own ideas on how to improve the United\nNations.\nWe reaffirm our readiness to make an active\ncontribution to the work of the Organization and to support\nall endeavours aimed at enhancing international cooperation\nand achieving peace and international accord.\nAt the same time I should like particularly to point out\nthat the United Nations today is an international forum of\n184 Member States, including those which, like Kazakhstan,\nonly recently gained their independence. Considerable\nexpansion of the membership over the past few years has, in\nour view, broadened the range and diversity of opinion\nwithin the Organization as well as pluralism in approaches\nto the analysis of international political events. To achieve\nconsensus today we need a collective search for new\nprinciples of coexistence of States in the United Nations, as\nwell as the improvement\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19\nand adaptation of the Organization to the rapidly changing\nrealities of modern life.\nIt is for this reason that we call upon all States\nMembers of the United Nations to consider our proposal to\nconvene a special session of the General Assembly devoted\nto the problems of strengthening international peace and\nsecurity, expanding the scope and potential of preventive\ndiplomacy, promoting human rights, and enhancing the role\nof the United Nations in an interdependent and integrated\nworld.\nWe believe that on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of\nthe United Nations it would be extremely useful to discuss\nnew goals and the challenges facing the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for us to salute your\nunanimous election, Sir, to preside over the General\nAssembly\u2019s work at its forty-eighth session, especially since\nyou are a worthy representative of a sister country of our\nregion of Latin America and the Caribbean. Your opening\naddress, in which you presented your vision of the world,\nwas rich in ideas and insights into international reality. You\nurged that we commit ourselves to promoting the purposes\nand principles of the Charter in order to achieve a better\nworld, and you encouraged us to reflect on our\nresponsibilities as we strive to meet the global challenges\nfacing our peoples. Your address demonstrated your\nsensitivity and wisdom, which, added to your political and\ndiplomatic experience in multilateralism, will help us move\nforward to change as we endeavour to achieve the objectives\nof our Organization.\nWe should also like to express our appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, the former Foreign Minister\nof Bulgaria, for the successful manner in which he guided\nthe work of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly and in particular for his efforts to bring about the\nrestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations system.\n\nWe also wish to join in the expressions of appreciation\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ndedication and hard work in leading our Organization. We\nonce again express our support for and confidence in him in\nhis difficult task of seeking international peace and security.\nFor the fifth year in a row we have come to this highest\ninternational forum, from which it has been our privilege to\ngive annual testimony to the progress of a process that,\nthough it is unfolding in a small developing country,\nrepresents one of the most complex and exemplary dynamic\nforces for peace in modern history.\nIn 1989, when we first came to speak to the world\u2019s\nrepresentatives from this rostrum, the case of El Salvador\nwas just one more knot in the tangled web of problems left\nbehind by the sadly notorious cold war as it began\nunexpectedly to wind down. A few months earlier, we had\njust taken the reins of government with a great purpose born\nin the deepest part of our conscience: to do all that was\nhumanly possible to find a political solution to the\nSalvadorean conflict. That is how we expressed ourselves,\nwith a solemn promise, to the Salvadorean people on the\nfirst day of our Government. We reaffirmed it before the\nUnited Nations in September of that crucial year of 1989,\nonly a few weeks before the world witnessed the almost\nunbelievable dissolution of one of the greatest ideological-\nmilitary Powers on Earth. This led to a new era - difficult,\nbut also hopeful and promising, for all.\nIf we wish sincerely to interpret the history of our\ncountry, we must say that the peace process in El Salvador\nwas a search along various avenues that had been present in\nthe lives of the people of El Salvador ever since our nation\nwas born. Our peace process is not a mere expression of the\nneed to find a sensible and reasonable end to an unjust and\npainful war. In El Salvador, as in so many other countries\nwith a historical development similar to ours, peace is the\ngeneric name for age-old needs and aspirations, such as\nthose for democracy, democratic institutions, the rule of law,\npolitical freedoms and rights - in a word, the victory of\ncivilization over barbarism.\nThis helped us to understand, as our work for peace\nbegan, that it must be solid and enduring. Otherwise, we\nwould be making just another effort - like so many in our\npast - that would not rise above superficial means or lay the\ntrue foundations of the country\u2019s political, social and\neconomic modernization. For us - and this is the aspect that\nhas enabled our process to succeed - peace is synonymous\nwith democracy.\nWe in El Salvador have been delighted to learn that,\nfrom varying perspectives of ideological and political\nthought, our peace process is considered exemplary. In this\nforum of nations, we should like to point to some of the\nfactors that, in our opinion, have allowed us to set that\nexample.\nFirst of all, we believe that the solution achieved is\nstrictly in keeping with the nature of the conflict. Given that\nit was a conflict with historical and social roots, its eruption\nwas eminently political, linked to the inadequacy and\ndysfunctioning of the traditional Salvadorean political system\nand the political-ideological confrontation of the super-\nPowers. The solution had to be political, without winners or\nlosers, and to aim at the creation of a new scenario involving\na system of pluralistic participation. The peace agreement\nis a plan of commitments to expanding, developing and\nguaranteeing democracy in El Salvador. That was what we\nneeded. That is why it was implemented in an irreversible\nmanner, despite momentary problems that were merely\nmishaps along the way.\nSecondly, the conflict led to violent confrontation in the\ncountry. The exhaustion from the war and the impetus\ntowards a process of democratization created the conditions\nfor the emergence in El Salvador of a culture of tolerance,\nunderstanding and reconciliation - in a word, a culture of\npeace. This concept has not emerged in El Salvador alone;\nit is a growing concern throughout the world. With the\nsupport of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization, we are striving to promote a culture\nof peace, for which we appeal for the firm support of the\ninternational community. Without a culture of peace, which\nwill help to remove the ever-active remnants of the culture\nof violence, it will be impossible to establish the new world\norder demanded by our times, a new moral order between\nmen and nations as the foundation for this new world order\nof competitive but respectful and harmonious coexistence,\nwhich we can glimpse as an achievable reality as we pass\ninto the new millennium.\nThirdly, we must recognize that the peace process in El\nSalvador was continually and effectively followed by the\ninternational community, represented by the Security Council\nand the Secretary-General of this great world Organization,\nby a group of countries that had close ties to the situation in\nEl Salvador in a variety of ways, and by a widespread\ngeneral interest in observing the ways and means used to\nresolve a conflict such as the one that afflicted El Salvador\nfor such a long time. We have no doubt that without this\ninternational attention a solution to the problem in El\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 3\nSalvador would have been much more difficult and\ncomplicated.\nEl Salvador is a living example of how the transition\nfrom a world dominated by a confrontational bipolarity to\none determined by the logic of specific situations is taking\nplace. We do not doubt for one instant that the engine of\nthe world process is changing: from abusive and heartless\nideology to pragmatic and ordered rationality. There have\nalways been many problems and conflicts in the world, but\nfor a long time the international drama seemed to be an\nincreasingly absorbing confrontation of ideologies. This\ndistortion, aggravated by the real problems that existed,\nimpeded their solution. It is true that since the cold war\npainful and cruel situations have erupted, such as the one\nnow experienced in the former Yugoslavia. But ideological,\nstrategic and geopolitical bipolarity artificially created some\nconflicts and stifled others, also artificially. Reality is, of\ncourse, a better guide than all the fantasies of the ideologies.\nWe in El Salvador do not speak of these matters with\nthe tranquillity of analysts or the scientific patience of\nacademicians. We speak of war because we have physically\nendured it. We speak of the worldwide ideological\nconfrontation because, during what we now know was its\nlast phase, El Salvador was one of its most intense\nbattlegrounds. And we also speak of peace because we are\nbuilding peace on the basis of an agreement of great\ninstitutional significance, conceived and structured to\nstrengthen democracy in El Salvador and throughout Central\nAmerica.\nWe have already expressed what this peace means to\nus. And now we would like to emphasize that we are well\naware that peace is a process. Being a process, it cannot be\nstatic, but must evolve. In this as well, El Salvador sets an\nexample. Countries such as ours were for long caught up in\nthe struggle between authoritarian stagnation and\nrevolutionary radicalism. This is a pivotal moment in\nhistory, because it is giving us all a lesson in the\npre-eminence of an ancient but under-valued concept:\nevolution. \\\"Everything changes,\\\" said the pre-Socratic\nphilosopher. But the natural rhythm of that change has\nalways been a kind of historical riddle. With many\ncertainties remaining, and in the healthy absence of the\nmagical formulas that have so tormented the world during\nour century, we are perhaps on the way to understanding that\nthe natural rhythm of change can also be summed in another\nclassic phrase: \\\"Without hurrying, but without pausing.\\\"\nWith evolution as our guide once again, we have no\nreason to hurry. The rhythm of transformation occurs in a\nway that cannot be resisted. We see this in the changing\ninternational, political and economic relations of our time.\nAn almost spontaneous restructuring has followed the\nremoval of so many straitjackets. And this restructuring has\nbrought to light what has always been most important: the\nreal problems. As the East-West conflict has disappeared,\nalmost no one speaks about the North-South conflict or\nalternative alignments, but the serious problems of\ninequality, critical poverty and dependence have not been\nresolved. They are still with us. And they are a challenge\nfor this new order which we are trying to create on a more\nrational and reasonable foundation.\nIn this new scenario, the United Nations has a central\nrole which was until recently unimaginable. The great\ndynamic of universal peace cannot be led by a single\ncountry, nor even by a privileged group of countries. The\ncooperation, understanding and support of all countries is\nneeded, as is an instrument which will make peace processes\nviable and monitor and support them. That instrument is\nthis Organization, and this special dimension of its work has\nexpanded and been emphasized in recent years. El Salvador\nhas the honour to have been one of the first countries to\nbenefit from the new United Nations system of peace-\nkeeping efforts. All the work of active mediation and then\nactive monitoring - unprecedented in international law -\nwhich the United Nations has been putting into practice in\nEl Salvador, is not some theoretical artifice, but an exercise\nderived from the necessities of a real situation. The dynamic\nof the Salvadorian process has shaped the role of the United\nNations in our country. We Salvadorians have learned much\nfrom our close relation with the world Organization, and we\nare sure that it too has learned very important lessons from\nits continuing participation in the achievement, maintenance\nand development of peace in El Salvador.\nOur view of the United Nations has been enriched as\nwe have shared with the world Organization the\nresponsibility of carrying out the peace plan in El Salvador.\nThus we understand more clearly that the United Nations is\nalso evolving. Its original form was a product of the end of\nthe Second World War; it must now open itself up to new\nrealities. Organs, such as the Security Council, and even the\nSecretary-General now have roles and responsibilities which\ndemand changes. The composition of the Council and the\nveto mechanism within it, which were a result of the deep\nmutual distrust of the post-war period, must be\nfundamentally revised to adopt them to times of cooperation\nand exchange. The Secretary-General\u2019s field of activity\nshould also be reconsidered, because there is far more\nexecutive work to be done today than in the past. All these\nare unavoidable challenges that now face the Organization,\nto which we owe so much and which we wish to see ever\nstronger and more efficient.\nThe United Nations has room for the whole world. In\nsuccessive addresses here, we have emphasized the\nimportance of the principle of universality. We understand\nthat this principle cannot in any way provide a means of\ninterfering in the internal affairs of States; at the same time\nwe believe that there are realities of today\u2019s world that\ncannot be disregarded. We have therefore supported\nconsideration of exceptional situations, in keeping with the\nexperience with parallel representation of divided countries\nat the United Nations. It should be possible to resolve this\nmatter within the framework of understanding and openness\nthat now characterizes international relations.\nEl Salvador, for the first time in its history, is in the\nvigorous mainstream of modernization, a dynamic that\nconcerns all countries during these times of change. Our\ncontribution cannot be material, because we lack resources\nand wealth, but we have earned the capacity to speak with\nthe moral force of a people raising itself up from its own\nrubble with the unexpected serenity that results from\nprolonged suffering. If we in El Salvador can testify to\nanything, we can testify that it is possible to move from\nirrationality to the deliberate construction of historical\nrationality. In proceeding along this long path we need the\ninternational community\u2019s political, moral and financial\nsupport, in keeping with the resolution that the General\nAssembly adopted last year for the reconstruction and\ndevelopment of El Salvador.\nWe must reincorporate ex-combatants in institutional\nand productive life through programmes such as the transfer\nof land for farming. Also, there are many new institutions\nemerging in our country, such as the civilian national police,\nwhich is one of the most ambitious experiments in public\nsecurity in the world. We need timely technical and\neconomic support to build the structures of peace more\nswiftly. We would like to be able to wipe from our minds\nthe discouraging evidence that it is easier to find the money\nfor war than for peace. The culture of peace - which is a\nworld-wide challenge - must also become evident in this\nfundamental change in priorities.\nWe are here for the last time because our presidential\nmandate comes to an end on 1 June 1994. It has been an\nimmense honour for us to come here every year to report on\nthe progress in a process that is of such great concern to the\npeople of El Salvador, and yet is also of such concern to\nCentral America and the international community because of\nits positive effects on regional stability.\nThe country that we are talking about today is very\ndifferent from the one that we were discussing in 1989, and\nthe important thing is that what is surprising in the\ndifference is how positive and how full of hope it is. The\ncredit is not ours. We did our work and exercised our will.\nThe credit goes to a people that, from being a footnote to\nhistory, has won, by dint of sacrifice, a place of honour in\nthis changing scene that we are seeing emerge at this close\nof the century.\nAll the political and social forces in El Salvador have\nworked together to bring about the emergence of the new\ncountry. The friendly countries that are closest to us by\nreason of history and geography can testify to this. We have\nmade a successful effort to bring order to our economy, and\nwe are laying the foundations for the continued constructive\nadvance of full democracy - political, economic, social and\ncultural.\nEl Salvador expresses its concern over the continued\nexistence of conflicts that are devastating some parts of the\nworld. The tragic cases of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of\nSomalia cause us great distress. However, we have\nconfidence in the force of reason, which always finds a way\nto achieve even the most difficult goals.\nAnd there is good news too, such as the extraordinarily\nimportant agreement on mutual recognition between Israel\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has thrilled\nthe world. We have also seen an opening up in South\nAfrica for reason to prevail, and the situation in Haiti\nbecoming clear, albeit with difficulty. All that gives us\ncomfort, and reminds us that we are in a period of enormous\nsurprises. The world is ridding itself of many oppressive\nspectres, and this gives us the strength to believe in the great\npotential of the international system.\nIf we had to prepare a list of all those to whom we\nwould give thanks for their contribution to peace in El\nSalvador, we would always leave out a few, but we cannot\nfail to mention the extraordinary work carried out both by\nthe previous Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar,\nand the present Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, and also their body of collaborators and\nadvisers, without whose participation and support it is\nunlikely that we would have achieved the goal of putting\nEl Salvador on the road towards genuine peace. The\nSecurity Council has always been very mindful of the peace\nprocess in our country, and the Council\u2019s active even-\nhandedness also deserves our highest praise.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 5\nOn behalf of El Salvador, I give thanks to everyone.\nEl Salvador is a living example. We hope that we will\ncontinue to be an example of stability, respect for human\nrights, national concord and progress. We therefore call on\nthe world to give us its attention and support, and, most of\nall, we ask God to shed his light on El Salvador, on the\nUnited Nations and on all men and women of good faith on\nthis Earth of ours, which is a common inheritance that must\nbe shared by all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "May I at the outset congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally on his unanimous election as\nPresident of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nHis long and rich experience makes him suitably qualified\nto preside over this session. I can assure him that he will\nenjoy the full support and cooperation of my delegation in\ncarrying out his mission.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend to\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, my heartfelt congratulations on the efficient\nmanner in which he presided over the General Assembly at\nits forty-seventh session.\nLet me also take this opportunity to pay a special\ntribute, once again, to our Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the high quality of leadership\nhe is providing to our Organization.\nIt is encouraging to note the growing membership of\nthe United Nations each year. It is, in the words of the\nSecretary-General, an explosion in United Nations member-\nship. I should like to extend, on behalf of the Gambia and\non my own behalf, sincere congratulations to Eritrea, the\nPrincipality of Andorra and the Principality of Monaco on\ntheir admission as Members of the United Nations. It is our\nfervent hope that they will not only be able to realize their\nnational aspirations but also contribute to the positive\nfulfilment of mankind\u2019s hope for a better world.\nIt was with deep shock and sorrow that we learned of\nthe devastating earthquake in parts of India. In this\nconnection, I should like to convey the heartfelt condolences\nof the Government of the Gambia to the Government of\nIndia and the members of the bereaved families on the\noccasion of this catastrophe. We also commend the laudable\nefforts of the Government of India in coping with this\nmassive disaster.\nWe are meeting this year against the background of\nrenewed hope, following the significant developments in the\nMiddle East and South Africa. Until recently, the Middle -\nEast crisis and the situation in South Africa posed a real\nthreat to international peace and security. Today, however,\nit can be said with a high degree of certainty that in both\ncases the peace process is irreversible.\nThe other notable event of major international\nsignificance has been the World Conference on Human\nRights held in Vienna last June. Coming soon after the end\nof the cold war and 25 years after the first International\nConference on Human Rights, this year\u2019s World Conference\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\non Human Rights reflected the hopes and aspirations of\nteeming millions of human beings seeking new solutions,\nreadjustments, changes and improvements to their conditions.\nIn many ways, the World Conference on Human Rights\nsymbolized the end of one era and the beginning of a new\none with regard to the promotion and consolidation of a\nstrong human-rights culture world-wide.\nFor us in the Gambia, the convening of the World\nConference on Human Rights was a refreshing experience,\ngiven our long-established tradition in the protection and\npromotion of human rights. The Conference enabled us to\nstrengthen our resolve to continue to uphold these much-\ncherished values.\nIn reviewing the outcome of the World Conference on\nHuman Rights, my delegation is pleased with the adoption\nof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which\nwill serve as a human-rights blueprint for the next century.\nI would urge the Assembly to consider and approve the\ndocument. We regret, however, the failure of the\nConference to agree on the setting up of the office of high\ncommissioner for human rights. My Government continues\nto give its strong support to this proposal, as we are\nconvinced that the office, if created, would facilitate greater\ncoordination of United Nations efforts and provide a more\nprompt and effective response to critical cases of gross\nviolations.\nThe issue of human rights, however, needs to be\naddressed fully in all its composite parts. Political and civil\nrights go hand in hand with economic, social and cultural\nrights. Such problems as poverty, hunger, and illiteracy that\nhave characterized developing countries constitute a serious\nthreat to stability and respect for political rights in these\ncountries. As my President, Sir Dawda Jawara stated at the\nConference in Vienna in respect of political rights and the\nright to development,\n\\\"We need to remind ourselves of the indivisibility and\nthe interdependence of both rights and the necessity of\ngiving equal attention and urgent consideration to both\\\".\nIt is saddening to note that at a time when such\ninternationally recognized values as democracy, human rights\nand rule of law are becoming the order of the day almost\neverywhere, some seemingly intractable conflicts in other\nparts of the world threaten to turn back the hands of time.\nThe situation in Somalia, which appeared to have\nimproved only about a year ago, has suddenly deteriorated,\ngenerating cause for serious concern. My delegation is\nparticularly alarmed by the dramatic turn of events resulting\nin the deaths of some members of the United Nations peace-\nkeeping force and also of some Somalis. To the families of\nall these fallen servicemen and those of other innocent\nvictims of the Somali conflict, we extend our heartfelt\ncondolences. We very much regret these unfortunate\nincidents, but they should, no matter how tragic, neither\ndampen the enthusiasm nor weaken the resolve of the\ninternational community to assist the Somalis in their search\nfor lasting peace and stability. Let us not forget now, in the\nheat of the moment, the very positive achievements of the\nintervention, which has made it possible to distribute food\namong a population that was suffering from one of the most\nhorrendous forms of famine.\nIn the present circumstances the need for general and\ncomplete disarmament of all factions cannot be\noveremphasized, and this must be pursued with renewed\nvigour. I should like to appeal to the United Nations and, in\nparticular, to the United States of America and all those\nother countries that have agreed to send troops to Somalia to\ncontinue their assistance so that peace and security can\nreturn to this troubled land.\nWe call on all the parties to the conflict to cooperate\nfully, to respect all the relevant Security Council resolutions\nand to implement without any further delay the Addis Ababa\naccord aimed at achieving national reconciliation.\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina also\nconstitutes a major preoccupation of the international\ncommunity. Recent efforts to establish a credible and lasting\npeace in the country have yet to bear fruit. The failure, so\nfar, to resolve the conflict and the persistent disregard of\nSecurity Council resolutions - in particular, resolution 713 (1991) -\nmake the situation even more desperate. The Gambia\ndeplores the continued Serbian aggression against the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It deplores the\nacquisition of territory by force, by means of the heinous\npractice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and other war crimes. My\ndelegation is firmly of the view that if the international\ncommunity is unwilling or unable to protect the defenceless\nMuslim population against Serbian aggression, it must be\ngiven the opportunity to defend itself in accordance with\nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter, which recognizes\nthat peoples must be able to exercise their right of\nself-defence. We welcome the establishment of an\ninternational war crimes tribunal as a fitting response to the\natrocities perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn Angola, the fighting continues with unprecedented\nintensity and ferocity. We condemn the naked and brutal\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 17\naggression by UNITA against the Government and people of\nAngola. The people of Angola, through the democratic\nprocess - whose principles are the very ones we have been\nproclaiming in this Hall - have given their verdict. Their\ndecision must be respected, and the international community\nshould provide all necessary support for action against any\nforce that seeks to disregard or overturn it. We therefore\nwelcome the recent decision of the Security Council to\nimpose sanctions on UNITA.\nThis year - 1993 - has not been one just of conflict,\nturmoil and bloodshed. Very notable successes have been\nachieved in mankind\u2019s search for peace, and these augur\nwell for the future.\nWith the conclusion of the Cotonou Peace Accord and\nthe installation of a five-man Council of State to lead Liberia\nto democratic elections after six months, there is renewed\nhope of a peaceful and lasting solution to the Liberian\nconflict. We welcome the contribution of the Government\nof the United States of America to the United Nations Trust\nFund, and we call on all other donor countries to contribute\nsimilarly so that additional peace-keeping forces may be\nspeedily deployed in Liberia to ensure full implementation\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) peace agreement.\nWith respect to South Africa, there are now clear\nindications that the peace process is on track and that change\nis irreversible. My delegation welcomes the agreement\nreached in the multi-party negotiating forum to set up a\nTransitional Executive Council, following agreement on the\ndate of the first non-racial, democratic elections.\nIn this connection, we fully support the recent appeal of\nthe President of the African National Congress (ANC),\nMr. Nelson Mandela, that sanctions be lifted. The removal\nof sanctions would send to all parties a strong, positive\nsignal that the rest of the international community will not\nbe found wanting in support and encouragement for the\ndifficult transition to a non-racial and democratic society.\nHowever, we regret the recurrence of violence, which, if it\nis not addressed satisfactorily, may have serious\nrepercussions for the transitional arrangements. We\ntherefore call on the South African authorities to redouble\ntheir efforts to stem the rising tide of political violence.\nThe recent breakthrough in the Middle East talks,\nevidenced by the deal between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) granting limited autonomy to\nthe Palestinians in Gaza and in the city of Jericho, is a most\nwelcome development. It constitutes a major step in the\nquest for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. We\nextend our heartfelt congratulations to those in the leadership\nof the two parties for their courage and foresight in making\neven this limited success possible in a land often\ncharacterized by hate, mistrust and destruction. It is true\nthat much remains to be done, but we are optimistic that the\nmomentum generated by the Israeli-PLO agreement will be\nsustained and expanded to enable all parties to the conflict\nto strengthen their resolve in the search for a comprehensive\nand durable solution in accordance with Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nWhile the recent developments between Israel and its\nArab neighbours provide ground for much optimism, the\nsituation between Kuwait and Iraq has failed to register\nsimilar progress. I call on the Government of Iraq to\ncomply fully with United Nations resolutions and, in\nparticular, to ensure the early release of Kuwaiti and other\nprisoners.\nWe have followed with keen interest the successful\nconduct by the United Nations of elections in Cambodia.\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff, as well\nas all the countries that helped to bring stability back to\nCambodia. We hope that the lessons of this exercise will be\nconsolidated and will be applied to other trouble spots that\nmay require the assistance of the United Nations.\nThe threat to world peace and stability emanates not\nonly from armed conflicts but also from socio-economic\nfactors. The global economic recession has led to worsening\neconomic and social problems. Among the pressing\neconomic difficulties that continue to face the developing\ncountries is the problem of external debt servicing, which is\none of the major obstacles to development. In sub-Saharan\nAfrica, the debt stock has increased to $185 billion -\nequivalent to 110 per cent of that region\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct. As of today, one third of Africa\u2019s total export\nearning is paid to the developed countries in the North to\nservice its debts. This situation cannot be allowed to\ncontinue. More than ever before, there is a need for a\nconcerted and innovative international effort to find a\npermanent solution to the problem. It is our view that the\ninternational community - particularly the industrialized\ncountries - has not given this problem the level of attention\nit deserves.\nWhile Africa\u2019s indebtedness has continued unabated, its\nproduction output, in both agriculture and industry, has\ncontinued to decline. The combined negative effect is\naggravated by serious inflation, which has contributed to a\nsteep decline in domestic savings and investment.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe international community\u2019s commitment to\nsustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by\nencouraging increased direct foreign investment, as well as\nan increased international transfer of financial resources to\nthe region. This is crucial to any long-term improvement in\nAfrica\u2019s economic situation.\nI should add that the removal of unfair trade practices\nwould go a long way towards eliminating the need for aid.\nThis is why we are anxious to see an early conclusion of the\nUruguay Round, which we hope will address the thorny\nissue of market access, as this is of major concern to\ndeveloping countries.\nFinally on this issue we call on the United Nations to\nprovide the necessary support for the successful implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development\nof Africa in the 1990s and the work of the United Nations\nInter-Agency Task Force on African Economic Recovery\nand Development.\nWe welcome the initiative of the Japanese Government\nin convening the Tokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment and hope it will contribute to the mobilization\nof financial and technological resources much needed to\nensure Africa\u2019s development.\nIn translating the spirit of Rio de Janeiro into action,\nthe Gambia has already launched its Environmental Action\nPlan in order to address the serious environmental problems\nfacing the country. Coming from a Sahelian country we\nremain particularly concerned about the continuous threat\nposed by drought and human actions to our fragile\necosystem. We welcome the setting up of the\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee and the\ncommencement of the negotiation process for the drawing up\nof an international convention to combat drought and\ndesertification particularly in Africa. The Gambia will\ncontinue to give full support to this Committee.\nThe success of our efforts to implement Agenda 21 and\nother programmes approved in Rio and adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly will depend to a very large extent on the\navailability of funds and the commitment of our partners to\nshare resources and encourage technology transfer to forge\na truly global partnership between developed and developing\ncountries in sustainable development.\nIn this connection we share the view that the Global\nEnvironment Facility (GEF) should be restructured to allow\nfor the increased participation of developing countries in all\nits activities as well as for inclusion of desertification as one\nof the areas eligible for GEF funding. It is hoped that in\nphase II of the GEF there will be an expanded financial base\nto allow for greater and more rational disbursements.\nIt has now become established practice to convene\nsummit meetings on issues of major concern to humanity.\nThese summits provide an opportunity to arrive at a\ncollective decision at the highest level on ways and means\nof resolving these difficulties. It is in this light that we\nwelcome the World Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and the World Summit for Social Development\nto be convened in 1995.\nAs we move closer to the end of this century, so is the\nUnited Nations moving closer to its fiftieth anniversary,\nsignalling the maturity of our thoughts and the wisdom of\nour actions in seeking global peace and security. As the\nprimary role of the United Nations is the maintenance of\nworld peace and security, it becomes imperative in this\npost-cold-war era to prepare the world body to carry out its\nmandate as stipulated in its Charter, taking into account the\nprevailing international political climate.\nIn this connection my delegation notes with keen\ninterest the restructuring and revitalization of the United\nNations. We welcome efforts to streamline and rationalize\nthe work of the General Assembly at the level of both the\nplenary Assembly and the Main Committees. These efforts,\nit is hoped, will strengthen the decision-making role of the\nGeneral Assembly and enhance its effectiveness and\nefficiency as the largest and most important organ of the\nUnited Nations system. Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council\nshould be redefined and better coordinated.\nAs regards the reorganization of the Security Council,\nefforts should be made to ensure transparency in its work\nand activities. The Gambia would support any proposals for\nthe reorganization of the Security Council on the basis of\nequitable geographical representation.\nI wish to conclude by again expressing our faith in the\ncapacity of the United Nations, strengthened in its authority\nand credibility, to face the many challenges that lie ahead.\n"

        "file_text": "I am particularly pleased to congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of\n\nthe General Assembly, which does honour to the Group of\nLatin American and Caribbean States. We know that he has\nlong-standing close personal ties to Chile.\nIt has been our lot to witness and to be a part of events\nof far-reaching significance in the history of mankind. The\npolitical, technological, economic and social changes that\nhave shaken the world over the past 10 years are beginning\nto take root, and as they do so the enormous influence they\nhave had on the establishment of new forms of behaviour,\nnew values and new institutional schemes is becoming\napparent.\nThe maintenance of democracy as the single paradigm\nhas brought with it beneficial influences, although for some\nthe establishment of this system of coexistence has given\nrise to upheavals which are not yet over. But we can afford\na measure of realistic optimism if we fix our attention on\nother developments. The beginnings of an agreement\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis are a tangible example of\nthis. Another is the awakening of South Africa to true\ndemocracy. The spirit of consensus that is beginning to\nspread throughout the world is a consequence of the\ndemocratic paradigm. Against this new backdrop, the\nUnited Nations has a vital role to play.\nAt this juncture, then, there are grounds for optimism,\nand we have a duty to be optimistic. For only in being\noptimistic will we be able to overcome the reluctance of\nsome and the temptation of others to take refuge in\nfundamentalism. It is also imperative for us to take a firm\nstand against a kind of rigidity of approach which is gaining\nground in the world. This is the tendency to treat systems\nas if they were incontrovertible truths. It is the transfer of\ndogma to sciences that are not at all exact. And this is\nhappening at a time when advances in human knowledge are\ndemonstrating precisely that what is vital today is to open\nour minds to reason and to distance ourselves as far as\npossible from dogmatism.\nWe are living in a world which has ceased to be\nforeign. No human reality is alien to us. No suffering is\nremote. No triumph of intelligence is a private matter. But\nglobalization does not mean uniformity. What is more,\nwithout respect for differences, it would cease to have the\nvigour it exhibits today. Its competitiveness would be lost,\nand the concept of one world would inevitably find itself on\nits deathbed.\nThis is the world in which we have to live and move,\na world plagued by disturbing yet, paradoxically, stimulating\ncontradictions. It is in such a world that we must strive to\nseize the opportunity to take positive initiatives, without\nprejudices, and come closer to the innermost reality of man.\nThis is why we are now striving to make progress in the\ndefence of universal humanitarian law. This concept is\ninherent in the new vision of the world, and Chile comes\nforward as its most resolute proponent. It is this concept\nwhich has led the \\\"Blue Helmets\\\" in the past three years to\ntake on as many missions as they conducted between the end\nof the Second World War and the beginning of the 1990s.\nThe United Nations troops serve the invaluable objective of\npeacemaking and rebuilding coexistence, a task which we\nmust perform if we are to meet adequately the need to strike\nthe proper balance between local sensitivity and global\nsensitivity.\nThe number of problems that are worldwide in scope\nhas greatly increased. Whether through rigidity in the\napplication of the system or through shortcomings in the\nsystem itself, we are witnessing some tragic consequences.\nMillions of human beings are suffering from poverty. Nor\nis the tragedy confined to the poor nations. We are\nwitnessing a worldwide social crisis. It has left its mark on\nthe developed countries as well. Social marginalization is a\nreality which has taken on truly disturbing dimensions\nhitherto unknown in those latitudes.\nChile\u2019s present Government has always viewed\neconomic development as inseparable from social\ndevelopment. We see the economy not as an end in itself,\nbut as a means by which humanity can attain happiness.\nThis is our objective, and this is what has led President\nPatricio Aylwin to assign the priority to dealing with what\nwe have termed the social debt. This term encompasses the\nrecognition that society as a whole must accord to the poor.\nThis idea has gained ground. As a result, the Chilean\ninitiative regarding the convening of a world summit for\nsocial development has been positively received. The\nmeeting, to be held at Copenhagen in 1995, will be a\ntangible demonstration of this concern on the part of the\nUnited Nations.\nMy country is confident that we will make every effort\nnecessary to ensure that the Copenhagen meeting arrives at\nappropriate and specific solutions. The environment is\nfavourable, which makes us feel that we shall be able to\nconclude the summit with an \\\"agenda or programme for\npeople\\\", one essential element of which must be broader,\nmore effective and more united international cooperation.\nToday\u2019s world poses questions which must be answered\nwithout delay. Poverty, hunger and other social scourges are\nperceived as aberrations. Their eradication is the task of the\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ninternational community as a whole. In this task, the United\nNations will play a decisive role. It has the capacity to take\nthe leadership, which means channelling international\ncooperation.\nFurthermore, we recognize that the United Nations has\na fundamental role to play in dealing with the relevant\nissues.\nIn the specific field of international peace and security,\nmy country has repeatedly stressed its support for the action\ntaken by the Secretary-General, and Chile advocates the\nstrengthening of his role, particularly with respect to\npreventive diplomacy. We hail his report \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\" as a valuable and significant aid to Governments.\nWe look forward with interest to the forthcoming publication\nof an agenda for development, which we intend to consider\nwith the greatest enthusiasm.\nIn the same spirit of cooperation, we have conveyed to\nthe Secretary-General suggestions regarding the benefits that\nmight derive from an increase in the number of members of\nthe Security Council. Because of the great importance of\nthat body, any change that is proposed should reflect the\nvery clear political will of the majority. I want to put great\nemphasis on this point. We view the changes in the Security\nCouncil as part of a wide-ranging exercise aimed at\nstrengthening the United Nations. No reform can be viable\nif its sole aim is to grant some degree of political\nrecognition to certain emerging Powers. The aim of our\nproposal is that appropriate account be taken of the new\ninternational reality. At the same time, it seeks to reflect the\nincrease in the membership of the Organization since the last\ntime the Council was enlarged.\nIn our suggestions to the Secretary-General, we indicate\nthe need for the reform to result in a limited membership.\nThis will enable us to ensure efficiency and to achieve our\nobjectives of democratization. In this context, we feel that\nit is important that the various regions of the world be duly\nrepresented. This will enable us to combine the idea of\ndemocratization with the balance that is essential.\nRegarding the right of veto, we agree with many\nnations that this is not a democratic means of\ndecision-making. For this reason we wish to make it clear\nthat we are opposed to its being extended to new permanent\nmembers of the Council. In line with these ideas, Chile has\nraised the possibility of the Council\u2019s comprising permanent\nmembers, permanent members without the right of veto,\nregional members with an extended term, and non-permanent\nmembers.\nStill in the context of the protection of democracy, we\ncannot fail to mention that at the regional level too new\ncircumstances have led to changes in the instruments\navailable to the Organization of American States (OAS).\nClear evidence of this is the Santiago \\\"Commitment to\ndemocracy and the renewal of the inter-American system\\\"\napproved at the General Assembly of the OAS held in the\ncapital of Chile in 1991. This new approach has already\nyielded results. The OAS has achieved successes that would\npreviously have been impossible in the region - particularly\nin the field of the protection of democracy and human rights.\nOf concern to us, together with steps in these two\nsensitive areas, is decisive action for the protection of nature.\nCurrently, Chile holds the chairmanship of the environment\ncommission established within the organization.\nIn addition, my country has joined in the effort to\ncombat drug trafficking. Accordingly, we support various\ninitiatives aimed at drafting new legal instruments to combat\nthis scourge effectively.\nLikewise - returning to the world scene - we attach\nspecial importance to the process of restructuring in the\neconomic and social sector. This will raise the possibility of\nsaving millions of human beings who are currently\nmarginalized, living in minimal security conditions. In our\nview, cooperation for development should become one of the\nmost solid pillars of the international agenda for the twenty-\nfirst century. We shall continue to put forward ideas and to\nsupport initiatives, in the Group of 77 and any other body,\nthat will serve to advance the negotiations.\nPresident Aylwin\u2019s Government has striven to make\ninternational cooperation a reality. We have participated in\nvarious activities within the programme of technical\ncooperation between developing countries. Currently, we\nhave projects in 43 countries, and 70 institutions from the\npublic and private sectors are participating in them.\nThere is an active current of cooperation with our\nneighbours in Central America, the Caribbean and South\nAmerica. Also under way are projects that link us with\nMexico. Similarly, we have programmes with the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nRecently, contacts have been established with African\ncountries and with South Pacific island territories. All of\nthis forms part of a deliberate policy aimed at strengthening\nlinks with the Latin American and Caribbean nations and at\nestablishing close ties with all developing countries.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 39\nAn outstanding feature of the major changes taking\nplace throughout the world is the important role being\nassumed by the Pacific basin in political, economic and\nstrategic terms. Chile is a coastal State of that ocean, and\nour identification with the basin is one of the most\ninnovative elements in the foreign policy being pursued by\nPresident Aylwin. We have made a sustained effort to\nassociate ourselves with the main agreements on cooperation\nin the Pacific region. Since 1990, Chilean business has been\nparticipating actively in the Pacific Basin Economic Council,\nand since 1991 Chile has been a full member of the Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council. We hope also to join the\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council, as we view this\nas an important means of promoting the liberalization of\nregional and world-wide trade. In this effort we have\nreceived valuable support from the States members of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, and for this we are\ngrateful.\nIn another context, I cannot fail to take this opportunity\nto mention an issue that is of special significance to the\ndeveloping world. I refer to the Uruguay Round of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The\nrenewal of these negotiations provides some grounds for\nhope. The so-called Dunkel text is very far from meeting\nour legitimate aspirations, although it does constitute a major\nadvance in the current situation. Unfortunately, nonetheless,\nit embodies a number of limitations on genuine freedom of\ntrade.\nThe most difficult issue in the Uruguay Round has been\ntrade in agricultural products, which, for the nations of Latin\nAmerica -for developing countries in general - is of vital\nimportance. Hence our lively interest in what is happening\nin GATT. Insistence on intransigent positions, which\nobjectively impede world trade, creates insurmountable\nbarriers to development - a situation to which we cannot\nremain indifferent.\nChile has fully discharged its commitment to the\ncollective security system. We regard this United Nations\ninitiative as highly appropriate in the current international\nsituation. My country has participated in a number of\npeace-keeping operations. It has sent military observers to\nthe Middle East and to the frontier between India and\nPakistan; police officers to El Salvador; air force personnel\nto Kuwait; and army personnel to Cambodia.\nIn discussing this issue, we cannot overlook the\nfinancing difficulties that peace-keeping operations are\nfacing. We support the steps being taken by the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to overcome these\nproblems.\nUnquestionably, however, in our view, any discussion\nof peace is incomplete if it does not refer to the progress\nmade in relation to disarmament. The Convention on\nchemical weapons is a significant achievement. We trust\nthat the work initiated with a view to the signing of a\ncomprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty will follow the same\ncourse.\nAt this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly, I\nwish briefly to evaluate the results Chile has achieved in\nsome of the areas to which it attaches priority in the\nrestoration of democracy.\nLet me refer first to our reintegration into the\ninternational community. In the multilateral sphere, we can\npoint to the generous support of our peers, which has\nenabled us to become members of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the Commission on Human Rights, the International\nLaw Commission and the Executive Council of the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and\nto the election of our Ambassador to the United Nations,\nJuan Somavia, as President of the Economic and Social\nCouncil and Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the\nWorld Summit for Social Development.\nIn keeping with its mandate, President Aylwin\u2019s\nGovernment sees human rights as another of the objectives\ntowards which its actions are directed, both domestically and\nin foreign policy. The latter aspect reflects a traditional\nposition of our country: that of encouraging respect for\ninternational law and promoting peace and justice. At the\nsame time, however, it is the least we can do by way of\nreciprocating the enormous solidarity the international\ncommunity has extended to the Chilean people at the most\ndifficult moment in its history.\nIt will be the task of the General Assembly at this\nsession to begin the implementation of the agreements\ncontained in the Plan of Action adopted at the second World\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna at the\nbeginning of this year.\nAlong with its re-emergence on the international scene\nand its protection of human rights and democracy, Chile has\nset itself the goal of working for effective regional\nintegration.\nHere, too, we can point to major achievements. Our\nrelations with our Latin American and Caribbean brothers\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncould not be better. Agreements that have already been\nsigned and various others that are in the drafting stage -\nsome 220 agreements and treaties in four years - bear\nwitness to this fact.\nTo that same end, we have worked for the\nstrengthening of the Rio Group; we currently have the\nhonour to be coordinating its temporary secretariat. That\ninstitution is the embodiment of a modern approach to\ninternational relations. It embodies the will of the region in\nits relations with individual countries or groups of countries\noutside the region. This forum for political consensus\nalready has significant achievements to its credit on various\nlevels. Moreover, it is a clear demonstration of what we can\naspire to if we manifest imagination, political openness and\nrealism.\nSpecial mention needs to be made of the understanding\nwe have reached with our neighbours. The understanding,\ngenerosity and vision of the future exhibited by the Heads of\nState of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Chile have allowed us\nto settle issues which in some cases had been dragging on\nfor more than a century. While respecting our respective\ntraditions and abiding by the inviolable principles of\ninternational law, including non-intervention and the sanctity\nof treaties as the source of rights, we have nevertheless\nunderstood that, as the twenty-first century approaches, it\nwill be useful to exchange ideas about our national\naspirations, inasmuch as they promote the maintenance of\npeace.\nIt is a great honour for me to be addressing the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The four\nyears I have represented Chile in this important forum,\nwhether accompanying President Aylwin or personally, have\nbeen an enriching experience.\nThe period in which we have the good fortune to be\nliving demands increasingly dynamic and effective\nresponses. The world is moving towards a new structure\nwhich will undoubtedly afford us the possibility of moving\never closer to satisfying the needs of human beings. But\nwhether we can make this a reality will depend on the\nintelligence with which we confront the future.\nI have every confidence in the rich sap that nourishes\nthis spreading tree, which shelters us all. The United\nNations has before it a glorious future in working for the\ncause of peace. But that future will be possible only if we\ndemonstrate the imagination to be bold, the knowledge to\nmove ahead, the love to understand that to strive for the\ncommon good is always a viable option, the solidarity to be\nmore human and the wisdom not to repeat the mistakes of\nthe past.\nMembers of the Assembly, my good wishes go with\nyou.\n"

        "file_text": " Please accept my warm\ncongratulations, Sir, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish you\nluck and success in your high office. At the same time, I\nextend a cordial welcome to the new Members of our\nOrganization.\nAddressing the Assembly 20 years ago, Willy Brandt\nsaid that the Federal Republic of Germany\u2019s purpose in\njoining the United Nations was to help serve the cause of\nworld peace. That has always been, and will remain, the\nfundamental aim of German foreign policy. At that time, in\na bipolar world, Germany was divided. In that year, 1973,\nthe October war broke out in the Middle East. In South\nAfrica the inhuman apartheid regime was dominant. Today\nmy country is united in peace and harmony with our\nneighbours. Today we can congratulate Israel, the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and neighbouring Arab\ncountries on a historic breakthrough. Today the policy of\napartheid has been overcome. Without the resolve to seek\npeace, these developments would not have been possible.\nWorld peace, which appears to have come closer as\nbipolarity has receded, must not remain an unfulfilled vision.\nThe international community\u2019s desire for peace led to the\nfounding of the United Nations after the Second World War.\nIt remains our moral and political obligation to fulfil that\nlegacy. There can be no more important task. In the quest\nfor peace we are faced with a new challenge and a new\ndanger, but we also have a historic opportunity.\nWe are faced with the great challenge of overcoming\nhunger and poverty around the world, of preserving the\nnatural sources of life, and of creating the foundations for a\nlong-term global population policy. When people have to\nleave their native lands, when human rights are violated,\nthere can be no peace. Peace is not merely the silence of\nguns. Hence, economic and social challenges must be very\nhigh on the global agenda. The world is deeply unjust. The\ndistribution of mankind\u2019s opportunities is woefully unequal.\nThis we should not tolerate.\nThe danger confronting us is that peace in many parts\nof the world is threatened by new conflicts, especially those\nof an ethnic nature. The continuing proliferation of modern\nweapons and weapon technology increases the destructive\npotential of these conflicts.\nOur opportunity, after the end of the East-West\nconfrontation, is to develop the United Nations into what its\nfounding fathers intended it to be: the principal guardian of\npeace. In performing that role the United Nations must have\nthe support of the numerous other international organizations\nthat are functioning successfully today.\nI truly believe that we can master the economic,\necological and social challenges and overcome the danger of\na relapse into a confrontation of States, peoples, cultures and\nreligions only if we resolutely seize the historic opportunity\nto strengthen the global multilateral system and the United\nNations.\nToday no country alone can cope with global\nchallenges. Hence we must counteract nationalism with\nmultilateralism. German foreign policy is aimed at\nstrengthening the multilateral world order. It is committed\nto the goal of European integration. Its purpose is to\nharmonize and create a fair balance of interests. German\nforeign policy is therefore a policy within, in support of, and\ntogether with the United Nations.\nI agree with the Secretary-General: Peace can only be\npreserved if we strike at the roots of conflict. His proposed\nagenda for development must go hand-in-hand with \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\". Misery, starvation and poverty are still\nthe overriding problem in many countries.\nAt the eighth session of the United Nations Conference\non Trade and Development and at the Rio Conference, the\ndeveloping and industrial countries agreed on a\ncomprehensive partnership for promoting development and\nprotecting the environment. For that partnership to be\nsuccessful both sides, North and South, must contribute their\nshare. By carrying out economic and political reforms,\nmaking more efficient use of their funds and cutting military\nexpenditure, and ensuring greater democratic control and\nrespect for the rule of law, many developing countries have\nembarked on the right course. The World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n1995, must be a forum for dialogue on the social issues\nre-emerging all over the world.\nThe industrial countries have undertaken to support the\nefforts of the developing countries by improving the general\nconditions for world trade in a spirit of solidarity. Such\nassistance can never be more than help towards self-help.\nWhat is required is more entrepreneurial cooperation with\ndeveloping countries, more direct investment, improved\ncooperation in the field of technology, the opening of\nmarkets and the elimination of trade barriers. The Uruguay\nRound of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) must at long last establish reliable rules for free\ntrade and be brought to a conclusion by December 15.\nGermany, one of the leading trading nations, is committed\nto these goals. If new trading blocs were to form, with the\nattendant conflicting interests, new political confrontations\nwould soon follow. Protectionism would be the worst\noutcome.\nThe global economy is in the throes of a fundamental\nstructural change. International competition is becoming\nmore intense. Many highly industrialized societies are\nconfronted with fresh challenges. Unemployment and\nsluggish growth are unexpectedly severe burdens on their\nproductive capacity, both domestically and externally. On\nthe other hand, the trend towards a single world economy\nopens up the first opportunity for billions of people to offer\ntheir products in all markets.\nAll of us, industrial and developing countries alike,\nmust make peace with nature. The United Nations is called\nupon to protect the natural foundations of life. I propose\nthat the United Nations develop an early-warning system for\nenvironmental disasters. The momentum of the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development must\nbe maintained. My country is ready for comprehensive\ncooperation. Germany can make a special contribution,\nparticularly as regards the transfer of environment-friendly\ntechnologies.\nThe population explosion is a threat to the planet\u2019s\nequilibrium. Whereas in the eighteenth century the world\npopulation increased by a quarter of a billion in 75 years, it\nis now increasing by this number every three years. Most\nof this increase is taking place in countries whose economic\nand ecological resources are already strained to the limit.\nFamily planning must be enhanced, the poverty gap reduced,\nand education and knowledge disseminated among women\nand men alike. A successful International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, to be held in Cairo next year,\nis therefore mandatory.\nRespect for human rights is a universal obligation. It\nis a focal point of German foreign policy. Human rights and\nthe protection of minorities belong together. Racism,\ncultural arrogance and the delusion of wanting to create\n\\\"ethnically clean\\\" areas constitute a threat to peace.\nYugoslavia is a terrible example of this. Where civic,\neconomic, cultural and religious rights of minorities are\nconcerned, the majority may not rule by fiat.\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action of the\nVienna World Conference on Human Rights represent the\nconsensus opinion of the community of nations. They\nreaffirm the universal validity of the human rights. Now it\nis important to seek rapid implementation. I wish to\nmention five specific points:\nFirstly, my country has long advocated the appointment\nof a high commissioner for human rights. He should be\nauthorized to take steps on his own initiative to protect\nhuman rights and to give active support to those countries\nseeking to improve the human rights situation.\nSecondly, we need an international criminal court. The\nInternational Law Commission has submitted a full draft\nstatute for such a court. The pressure on those who trample\nhuman rights under foot must be increased now. Those who\ntorture on this Earth must live in fear of punishment.\nThirdly, in order to prosecute speedily those who are\nresponsible for the ghastly violations of human rights in the\nformer Yugoslavia, the Security Council has set up an ad\nhoc Tribunal. The elected judges must now begin their work\nright away. A chief prosecutor should be appointed without\ndelay.\nFourthly, the non-governmental organizations have\nbecome part of the world\u2019s conscience and therefore have an\nincreasingly important role to play in the defence of human\nrights.\nFinally, the instruments for ensuring respect for human\nrights must be given a higher priority in the United Nations\nbudget.\nThe crisis in the former Yugoslavia, and especially the\nwar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is one of the most\ndepressing episodes of our time. A Member of the United\nNations has fallen victim to a war of conquest accompanied\nby genocide and mass expulsions. For the first time since\nthe Second World War, frontiers in Europe are being\nredrawn by force of arms. The principles of the United\nNations have been treated with contempt. The credibility of\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15\nour institutions - indeed the credibility of the United Nations\nitself - is being put to the test.\nIf the fighting continues, the winter will prove to be an\nawful disaster for the suffering people. It must therefore be\nstopped as quickly as possible and steps taken to ensure that\nhumanitarian aid is provided. We therefore support the\nGeneva efforts to settle the conflict, in spite of doubts about\nthe current plan, and we express special thanks to the\nCo-Chairmen, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, for the\ndifficult job they are doing.\nA settlement now seems within reach, but it must be\naccepted by all parties to the conflict. No party must impose\nits will on another. The Bosnian Muslims must be given\nviable territory. We need an assurance that the community\nof nations will be resolutely and actively involved in the\nimplementation of a settlement.\nWe cannot tolerate a situation in which the Muslims,\nwho have lived in Europe for centuries, would have fewer\nrights than their Christian neighbours. Through preventive\nmeasures we must ensure that the tragedy of this war does\nnot spill over into neighbouring regions. What is now\nrequired is proposals for controlled disarmament in the\nregion. This is a task for the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nAfter decades of war and bitter antagonism, the Middle\nEast is experiencing a historic breakthrough towards peace.\nWe all want the peace process to become irreversible.\nGermany and its partners in the European Community have\nundertaken to provide political, economic and particularly\nfinancial support. They have earmarked about a billion\ndeutschemarks for this purpose.\nI should like to express my respect for both sides for\ntheir political courage and their will for peace. I call upon\nthose who still hesitate to help sustain the peace process. I\nappeal to all to renounce the use of force.\nThe continuing proliferation of arms in many parts of\nthe world is still highly disturbing. President Clinton\u2019s\nproposals have our support. Encouraging progress has been\nachieved in the form of the Convention placing a global ban\non chemical weapons and of the agreement reached on a\nmandate for negotiations in the Geneva Conference on\nDisarmament with a view to a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nThe test moratorium must be extended. There must be no\nfurther testing.\nThe nuclear and non-nuclear Powers alike are urged to\nconsolidate the non-proliferation regime. When the matter\ncomes up for decision in 1995, the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nmust be extended indefinitely. As the representative of a\ncountry which many years ago unilaterally and bindingly\nrenounced the possession of nuclear weapons and other\nmeans of mass destruction, I appeal to all Members: accede\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThe laying of mines in large regions in many countries\nhas become a scourge for the population. It prevents the\nreturn of refugees and the resumption of farming.\nThousands have been killed or horribly mutilated. It must\nbe stopped. The European Community has, with our\nsupport, seized the initiative. We need a fund to finance\nmine detection and disposal operations.\nMy country\u2019s European anchorage is indispensable on\nboth political and economic grounds. My Belgian colleague,\nWilly Claes, has already explained the position of the 12\nmembers of the European Community.\nStability in Europe cannot remain a privilege of the\nWestern nations. The peoples of the reformist countries\nfought for their freedom and we encouraged them to do so.\nWe shall not abandon them now. We must gradually open\nthe road to the Euro-Atlantic institutions for the countries of\nCentral and Eastern Europe. Those institutions include the\nEuropean Community and the Council of Europe as well as\nthe Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). I am expecting a clear message from\nthe NATO summit - which is to take place at the beginning\nof 1994 - like the one that came from the European\nCommunity summit meeting in Copenhagen. In this process,\nno new ruptures must emerge. A lasting peaceful order in\nEurope is not feasible without including Russia.\nOver the last four years Germany has made a greater\nfinancial effort than any other nation to help the reformist\ncountries on their road to democracy, the rule of law and a\nfree market economy. This assistance, too, is a major\ncontribution to conflict-prevention and the safeguarding of\npeace. In the present critical phase, Russia\u2019s friends and\npartners - who include the Germans in particular - must\ncontinue to provide political and economic support for\nPresident Yeltsin\u2019s reforms.\nI am concerned about developments in Georgia. We\nmust achieve a cease-fire and work out a viable political\nsolution. This is a task for the United Nations in particular.\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe desire for peace makes it imperative for all\ncountries to seek closer regional cooperation.We support\nintra-Africa efforts to resolve conflicts and welcome the\nstronger commitment on the part of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity.\nWe are gratified by the democratic changes to be\nobserved in Latin America in recent years. Nearly\neverywhere democracy and free-market principles have\nasserted themselves and sources of conflict have, thank God,\nbeen eliminated.\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations has\nbecome an important instrument for cooperation in the\nAsia-Pacific region. European-Asian cooperation must be\nintensified.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" has become the lodestone for\nthe world Organization\u2019s further development. I wish to\ntake this opportunity, Mr. Secretary-General, to express my\nthanks for your commitment. The Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly have constructively taken up the Agenda\u2019s\nproposals. However, conflict prevention must begin at an\nearly stage. Preventing fires is better than having to put\nthem out. We must focus our energy on the possibilities of\npreventive diplomacy, confidence-building measures,\nfact-finding and the early detection of conflicts.\nThe CSCE must back the United Nations within its\nsphere of jurisdiction. The relations between the two\norganizations have been intensified. The CSCE should be\ngiven wider scope for conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement.\nIn wars and crises, the Blue Helmets have helped to\nprotect the civilian population, to prevent the spread of\nwarfare and to initiate the transition to democracy. Some\n80,000 troops from more than 70 countries are engaged in\n17 peace-keeping missions around the world. They and the\nUnited Nations Secretariat\u2019s Department of Peace-keeping\nOperations deserve our thanks.\nOne of the most successful operations was the one in\nNamibia. In Cambodia the United Nations has sponsored\nfree elections and restored hopes of lasting peace after\ndecades of terror and oppression. Of course - and it is\nimportant to stress this - not all the hopes placed in the\nUnited Nations can be fulfilled, and it would be wrong to\ndeny that difficulties have been encountered. But what\nwould happen without the United Nations and the Blue\nHelmets? To the critics I therefore say that we need not less\nbut more commitment to the United Nations.\nIn Somalia starvation has been overcome. The\nreconciliation process has been overshadowed by incidents\nin which troops and civilians have been killed. These are\ntragedies, but without the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia, hundreds of thousands would have had to die.\nGermany has been providing humanitarian aid within the\nscope of this major peace-keeping operation, our largest\ncommitment of personnel so far within the framework of the\nUnited Nations.\nOur involvement in such operations has the backing of\nthe German people. There is a consensus in our country in\nfavour of widening our scope for contributing to peace. We\nare engaged in a passionate debate over proposed\nconstitutional amendments which would enable Germany to\nparticipate in all United Nations operations without\nrestriction.\nA policy for peace also means strengthening the rule of\nlaw as opposed to the rule of the strong. If the United\nNations is prevented from carrying out its mandate, it will\nhave to be in a position to authorize the Security Council to\nresort to force, as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.\nHowever, the use of military means should be\nconsidered only if we have a clear political blueprint for\nresolving the conflict. Force must always be the last resort.\nConsequently, our contribution to the United Nations will\ncontinue to be of a mainly political and economic nature.\nGreater emphasis will have to be placed on United Nations\npeace-keeping measures in view of the growing\nresponsibilities and demands.\nFirst, the United Nations Secretariat\u2019s Department of\nPeace-keeping Operations must be improved logistically and\norganizationally and in terms of staff. The German\nGovernment is willing to make further experts available to\nthe Secretariat.\nSecondly, effective crisis management presupposes the\nability to react swiftly. The Secretary-General\u2019s initiative for\nthe establishment of stand-by forces has my support.\nStand-by forces should not be confined to military units but\nshould include civilian personnel and experts ranging from\npolice to election observers. But participation must always\nbe voluntary and be subject to the fulfilment of national\nconditions.\nThirdly, enhancing the efficiency of the United Nations\npresupposes a link-up of military forces. The North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) has declared its willingness to\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17\nmake its capacities available. The same holds true for the\nWestern European Union (WEU).\nFourthly, in many countries military training is geared\nsolely to the traditional duties of the army. The specific\ntasks of peace-keeping require a completely different kind of\ntraining. The national preparation of \\\"Blue-Helmet\\\" forces\nneeds to be coordinated to a greater degree by the United\nNations. For this, common training guidelines are needed.\nThe United Nations should also create its own training\ncapacity; that is my view. Common training and exercises\nare, at the same time, important steps in confidence-building.\nFifthly, peace-keeping operations require sound\nfinancing. The responsibility for peace also includes the\nprompt and complete payment of contributions by all\nMembers.\nHumanitarian concerns have been of pivotal importance\nfor Germany\u2019s involvement in United Nations activities from\nthe very start. In the Middle East, in Africa, in South-East\nAsia, in the Gulf region, in Somalia and in former\nYugoslavia we are providing humanitarian assistance. We\nhave assumed responsibility for transport, medical care, the\nmonitoring of disarmament measures and the repatriation of\nrefugees. Together with our partners in the European\nCommunity we have called for the creation of a post of\ncoordinator for humanitarian assistance.\nPart of our humanitarian commitment is the readiness\nto assist refugees from the civil war, whose situation is very\ndistressing. We have admitted more than 350,000 refugees\nfrom former Yugoslavia. I urge the General Assembly to\nuse every opportunity to strengthen the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Mrs.\nOgata deserves high praise for the job she is doing. More\ninternational solidarity and burden-sharing is called for. We\nmust not abandon those countries which, as neighbouring or\ntarget countries for the refugees, are particularly affected.\nThe aim must be to offer shelter to refugees from civil wars\nor other disasters near their home countries in order to\nfacilitate their early return to those countries. For this we\nneed binding rules. I therefore propose the drafting of an\ninternational convention to regulate large-scale refugee\nmovements.\nAnother focal point of our involvement in United\nNations activities has been what the Secretary-General refers\nto in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" as post-conflict peace-building.\nLasting peace depends on the establishment of democratic\nand market-economy structures based on the rule of law.\nInvestment in the democratization process is an investment\nin peace. My country, Germany, sees this as a priority of its\ncommitment to development. That is why Germany\nparticipates in missions to observe elections, provides\neconomic experts, and assists in the creation of democratic\nadministrative, judicial and police institutions.\nI should like to stress that a culture of peace is another\nprerequisite for lasting peace. Not only governments but\nalso individual citizens must develop the will for peace if we\nwant to overcome racial hatred and religious conflict. A\nculture of peace encompasses a dialogue between ethnic\ngroups as well as between religions and cultures. The\nEuropeans live next door to and in close contact with Islam.\nWe need bridges of mutual understanding, not new enemy\nimages. We need to promote education for peace. The\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO), with its mandate to foster relations\nbetween nations, therefore deserves comprehensive support.\nGermany advocates the strengthening of all United\nNations bodies. We do not want a never-ending discussion\non reform, but greater efficiency. We welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts to reorganize the Secretariat.\nThe efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council also meet with our full\nsupport. We would be happy if the United Nations were\nbetter represented in Germany and have therefore made an\noffer for the relocation of institutions of technical\ncooperation to Bonn.\nThe most important decisions on security and peace are\ntoday made in the Security Council. This is what the\nCharter envisaged right from the start. Anyone who wants\npeace must strengthen the Security Council.\nIn its response to the Secretary-General\u2019s request, the\nFederal Government has stated that efficiency and credibility\nare of equal importance for the future composition of the\nSecurity Council.\nGermany is prepared to assume responsibility as a\npermanent member of the Security Council also. I stated\nthis at the last session of the General Assembly. However,\nwe will be able to maintain and strengthen the credibility of\nthe Council only if, in deliberating on reforming it, we also\ntake into consideration the growing importance of the third\nworld.\nFinally, let me state that Germany wants to be and will\nbe a driving force in efforts to strengthen the United\nNations. We need to achieve a basic consensus for the\nimportant tasks ahead of us. In my view this consensus lies\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nin the rule of law. The law protects the weak and\nlegitimizes force where it is unavoidable. The law is an\nexpression of partnership and is opposed to tyranny and\nhegemony. It is the acceptance of law that creates justice.\nOnly where justice reigns can peace flourish.\n"

        "file_text": "Nearly all those who stand at this rostrum\nrepresent the dreams of their countrymen. Many who come\nto this Hall bring with them the hopes of their peoples,\nwhich have been shattered by violence, intolerance,\nselfishness or misunderstanding. But all, without exception,\nbring with them their own vision of the world; the sum of\nthose visions will provide a model for the world in which\nwe live and die and in which our children will live and\ngrow. It is therefore a great honour for me to address once\nmore so many men and women of all origins and all\ndestinies. The world listens expectantly to what we say\nhere, for the world has confidence and faith in the\ncommitment of the United Nations to action on behalf of a\nbetter future for all mankind.\nToday, as we begin this session, I believe that those of\nus who have worked for the triumph of peace and\ndemocracy are living at a crucial moment. Without doubt,\nthere is room for optimism, but our work is far from done.\nThe end of bipolarism has not by itself brought the\nfeeling that peace, progress and justice are now nearer or\nmore possible. While bloc confrontation has disappeared,\nwe are seeing the resurgence of harsh ancient nationalisms\nand fanaticisms that threaten peace and stability, and the\npresence of extreme poverty and social injustice in the\nmajority of the world\u2019s countries.\nEven as we meet here, thousands are dying, victims of\nracism, xenophobia, fratricidal wars, hatreds which have fed\non themselves for centuries, territorial disputes, or the simple\nand terrible inability of mankind to provide everyone with\nthat which all are promised: freedom and equal opportunity.\nAt the same time, we feel increasing pain at the\nsituation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in areas of Africa,\nin many Eastern European nations and in other parts of the\nworld.\nDuring this session we will also hear of hopes and of\ndreams of peace and reconciliation that until now seemed\nimpossible. I speak, for example, of the gradual abolition of\nracial segregation in South Africa. I point also to the fact\nthat rivals like Israel and the Palestinian Liberation\nOrganization have had the courage to declare mutual\nrecognition and respect. That Yitzhak Rabin and\nYasser Arafat can negotiate with courage and fortitude,\namidst their own memories of war, proves that when history\nis written, the greatness of the human spirit can flourish and\nprevail.\nAlthough we know that the road ahead is still long and\ndifficult, the Israelis and the Palestinians have the\nrecognition and support of the international community for\ntheir efforts to find peace. The agreements reached are\nfurther proof that the political will to reconcile is capable of\nhealing even the deepest wounds.\nMuch of the history of the twentieth century has been\nwritten with the blood of victims of war, religious disputes\nor blind quests for power. Too much history has already\nbeen written by tyrants.\nThe builders of the twenty-first century must be men of\npeace and work rather than of violence. The arms they use\nto build the future must not be cannons and bullets, but\nrather the wisdom, ingenuity and vision of men of initiative.\nPolitical activity, with its great capacity to transform\nreality, has in a few short years generated far-reaching\nchanges in the former Soviet Union, Central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East and my own region, Latin America.\nNever before have so many millions of people around the\nworld enjoyed freedom.\nWe Colombians, for example, have in just a few years\nachieved significant political, economic and social changes\naimed at developing a new democratic century that is more\nopen, more participatory, more pluralistic, more\ndecentralized and more just.\nOur new Constitution was conceived with the\nparticipation of all sectors of public opinion, including\nex-guerrillas, indigenous people, industrialists, human-rights\nactivists, environmentalists and millions of ordinary citizens.\nOur 1991 Constitution is the navigational chart of a new\nColombia heading for the next millennium.\nOn the economic front, we have replaced our old model\nof a closed economy with an open one, in which external\nmarkets have to become, increasingly, the engines of growth.\nWe are integrating our economy with the world and are\nhence demanding that other nations open their markets to\nour products. We are advocates of free enterprise, economic\nintegration and free trade. The results have been very\nsatisfactory: we have diversified and increased our exports,\nsignificantly lowered inflation, reduced unemployment and\nincreased economic growth.\nOn the social front, we have substantially increased\npublic resources available for financing new programmes of\ninvestment in our people. With this effort we shall double\nour present per capita income by the beginning of the next\ndecade. By that time life expectancy in Colombia will be\nsimilar to that of many industrialized countries. Our\nilliteracy rate will be less than 3 per cent and our infant\nmortality rate will be lower than 18 deaths per thousand\nbirths.\nIn Colombia we understand that political democracy\nmust go hand in hand with economic opportunity, because\na lasting true democracy can be achieved only through\neconomic development and social justice. It would be\ndifficult, after all, for people who had fought so hard for\nfreedom to find that the tough road to democracy led to\npoverty, marginalization or social stagnation. Political\nfreedom with economic opportunity: this is now the\ndefinition of democracy.\nThe developing world has placed its hopes in\ninternational trade as the instrument to create prosperity for\nall. In a global economy it is impossible to achieve social\nwell-being without economic freedom, competition,\nproductivity, efficiency and growth.\nPerhaps we now have, more than ever before, the\nconditions for an unprecedented increase in the flow of\ngoods, services, technology and knowledge between the\nindustrialized countries and the developing countries and,\ntherefore, for economic growth and the creation of\nemployment and social well-being for all.\nFor these reasons, this hemisphere\u2019s liberalization\nprocesses, such as the North American Free Trade\nAgreement (NAFTA), the Andean Group, the Group of\nThree, the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)\nand the integration of Central America and the Caribbean,\nare not just integrative trade agreements, but also represent\nreal remedies for poverty.\nI wish to stress the importance of NAFTA as a decisive\nstep in the right direction to liberalize trade relations, to our\nmutual benefit, between north and south. It is time to leave\nbehind outdated fears and commit ourselves to a relationship\nthat will undoubtedly result in stronger economic growth and\nhundreds of thousands of new jobs for all. Those of us who\nare supporters of an integrated, open and dynamic\nhemispheric economy fully support the visionary efforts of\nPresident Bill Clinton to achieve final approval of this treaty.\nAnd on a global scale it is critical to conclude the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) successfully. This will be possible only if we\ntruly respect the multilateral character of that organization.\nIt cannot be a matter of the most powerful agreeing among\nthemselves about what is in their own interests. We hope\nfor the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, but not at any\ncost. We seek effective solutions to address the concerns of\nthe least developed countries, with emphasis on dismantling\nagricultural protectionism.\nWe are deeply concerned that the attitude of many of\nthe principal actors in the global economy has come to\nresemble dangerously that of another era, the years before\nthe Second World War, when nations isolated themselves\nwithin their borders and produced goods for captive\ndomestic markets.\nDefending at any cost the selfish interests of privileged\nrural minorities in the industrialized countries takes bread off\nthe tables of millions of poor peasants who only want the\nright to compete on an equal footing. That selfish attitude\nis the greatest cause of poverty in the poor countries.\nWe live in a world where frontiers between nations\nought to be seen as points of convergence, not of division;\nwhere cries for independence should be replaced by shows\nof interdependence; where, for many developing nations, the\neuphoria of political change has passed and what is needed\nis economic growth and the creation of jobs.\nProtectionism and isolationism belong to outdated,\nperverse rhetoric. Do we really want to live in a world\nturned upside down, where the largest and strongest\neconomies deny the smallest ones the right to compete, or\nwhere the origin of goods and services is more important\nthan their quality or value?\nThe world must see that open markets and free trade are\nperhaps the best hope for serving the collective interests of\nboth north and south, not simply favours graciously granted\nto the developing world by the industrialized world. Free\ntrade is truly good business for everyone.\nThe economies of the developed world are made up for\nthe most part of mature markets that have already\nexperienced their greatest periods of expansion. The short-\nsightedness of protectionism lies in its ignoring the growth\npotential represented by investment in and trade with nations\nthat represent the future of the world\u2019s economy.\nAs President of Colombia, I want to reaffirm my\nnation\u2019s commitment to the defence of free trade, for we\nhave invested in it our hopes for development and\nwell-being. So, too, we see in free trade the best\ncontribution that the industrialized world can make to\nconsolidating democracy and freedom in developing\ncountries. Colombia is asking for free trade, not economic\naid; the opening of markets, not mere assistance;\ncompetition, not insurmountable barriers.\nFrom its inception, the United Nations has had the dual\nmission of maintaining international peace and security and\nof promoting the social and economic development of all\npeoples of the world. Even though we have been successful\nin advancing collective global security, we cannot say the\nsame as concerns the areas of social welfare and economic\ndevelopment. Today, I call upon the international\ncommunity to achieve, with courage and dedication, an\nagenda for development. Only then will the goal of a lasting\nand stable peace be reached, for without social justice, peace\ncannot be permanent.\nI should like also to mention Colombia\u2019s renewed\ncommitment to three issues of great global importance: the\ndefence and promotion of human rights, the fight against\norganized crime and the preservation of the environment.\nIn Colombia, we have made a major and successful\neffort to create a culture that promotes, respects and defends\nhuman rights. Today, we have the institutional foundations\nto ensure that Colombia\u2019s society will overcome human\nrights violations. The efforts to strengthen Colombia\u2019s\njudicial system has borne fruit. We are defeating impunity.\nIn our fight against international organized crime, which\nprofits from narcotics trafficking, terrorism,\nmoney-laundering, arms trafficking, the flow of illegal\nchemicals and various forms of corruption, my country many\nyears ago took a clear decision: Colombia will not rest until\nthese criminals activities are wiped from the face of our\nland.\nInnocent Colombians are continuing to lose their lives\nin the fight against evil multinationals. My deepest\nconvictions and my respect for the memory of so many\ncountrymen who have sacrificed their lives compel me to\ncall once again on all nations to contribute to the solution of\na problem that is global in its scope.\nMy people\u2019s brave efforts alone - or nearly so - cannot\nput an end to international organized crime; this will require\ndetermined action with courage and political will, on the part\nof many more nations. We cannot counter sophisticated\ninternational organized crime by simply developing national\nor bilateral strategies. We require a comprehensive,\nmultilateral effort that focuses on legislative cooperation;\ncoordinated initiatives; the exchange of intelligence\ninformation; a sufficient commitment of financial and human\nresources; cooperation in the judicial field; and, perhaps\nmost important, strong political will.\nTo this end, we will participate with great interest in\nthe high-level meeting that, on our initiative, will soon take\nplace during this plenary session. Its main purpose will be\nto review the global strategy against the plague of narcotics\ntrafficking, with a view to seeking coordination of concrete\nmeasures, the renewal of specific commitments and, finally,\nthe strengthening of the decision to continue with this joint\nstruggle.\nWith regard to the preservation of the environment,\nColombia is fully aware of the importance of its magnificent,\nvaried and sometimes fragile ecosystems and of its\nbiodiversity. Accordingly, we have adopted institutional\nchanges that will allow us to fulfil in its entirety a\ncommitment that stems not only from our Constitution but\nalso from our collective conscience and our stewardship of\na treasure we shall not squander.\nColombia supports sustainable development, respects\nthe terms of the agreements reached at the Earth Summit and\nis working with its neighbours, with other nations and its\nown communities to devise strategies that will allow it both\nto benefit from and to preserve its natural resources.\nI wish to conclude by congratulating the President of\nthe General Assembly, the Ambassador of Guyana, Mr.\nSamuel Insanally, an outstanding representative of my\nregion. We also welcome the new States Members of the\nUnited Nations. On behalf of Colombia, we welcome them\nto this universal fraternity, which is enhanced by their\npresence.\nAt the same time, I want publicly to express my\ncountry\u2019s satisfaction at having coordinated the work of the\nGroup of 77 this year. Thanks to the collaboration and\nharmony that prevailed among all its members, we made\nimportant advances in defence of the interests of the\ndeveloping world.\nBut the satisfaction of seeing the United Nations\nstrengthened each year by the presence of new Members\nshould not hinder us from reaffirming Colombia\u2019s position\nin favour of the restructuring of this Organization, especially\nwith regard to reforming the Security Council and to\nredefining the relationship between the General Assembly\nand the Security Council. We hope that in this respect an\nopen and a democratic and multilateral debate will take\nplace.\nI have come here today to ask a question that has been\non the minds of all peoples, in all parts of the world, who\nhave been on the side of the revolution of freedom: why\nhave so many millions of people in the former Soviet Union,\nin Central and Eastern Europe, and in countries throughout\nAsia, Africa and Latin America fought so hard? What is it\nthat so many hoped to achieve by taking, at the cost of\nimmense sacrifices, the road to democracy and its freedoms?\nI believe that the only answer is that they have seen, for\nthe first time, the possibility of transforming these dreams\ninto realities. And they have taken that road because they\nwant to a leave a legacy of freedom to their children and to\nfuture generations.\nWith the help of God and our strong solidarity, we are\ncertain that they will prevail.\n"

        "file_text": "In 1990 the Peruvian people - heirs to an ancient culture,\nwho, like other peoples of the third world, suffered the\nconsequences of colonialism and later various frustrations\ncaused by our history - began to ask themselves more and\nmore why they had not reached a truly dignified level of\nexistence comparable to that of the developed countries.\nWhy was it that a rich nation, known for its\nhard-working population and enjoying apparent democracy,\nshould have to suffer from hyperinflation, isolation from the\ninternational financial community, terrorism, drug-trafficking,\ncorruption and internal and external debt? In short, why was\nit ungovernable?\nThe so-called traditional democracy, which solved none\nof Peru\u2019s serious problems, had been nothing more than a\nstruggle between privileged minorities, the elite and party\nleaders who took turns in power while the country sank\ndeeper and deeper into misery.\nNations, however, do not disintegrate in such crises;\nrather, they are roused to carry out moral and material\nreconstruction. Such has been the case in Peru.\nI ask myself, and I ask all those present, the\nrepresentatives of all the nations of the world, \\\"Which is the\nfirst priority: the narrow, blind defence of an institutional\nformality that is now worthless and obsolete, or a better\ndestiny for millions of human beings?\\\"\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 7\nWe in Peru have experienced this disjunction which the\nGovernment of President Boris Yeltsin in Russia is\nexperiencing so dramatically today.\nWhy should we fear making corrections in the course\nof our history, however radical they may be? To govern is\nto confront problems firmly, and not to defer, much less to\nevade, decisions.\nIn exceptional circumstances, when the civilized\nexistence and survival of a nation is at stake, each country\nhas to find its own course and its own solutions and then\nreconstruct its democracy in touch with its own reality.\nFailing this, it will simply become ungovernable - a situation\nthat most often leads to anarchy, which in turn inevitably\ngenerates violence.\nThe institutions of Peru\u2019s incipient political system\nproved to be among the most inefficient on the continent.\nThat was the context within which Shining Path and the\nTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement came into existence.\nThe model for Shining Path is Pol Pot\u2019s Khmer Rouge.\nThis is why, for 10 years, that group\u2019s activities were\ndirected toward destroying the existing system: industries,\nlaboratories, electrical towers, machinery, bridges, highways\nand public buildings, costing the country US$ 25 billion in\nmaterial damages and losses. New York learned what\nterrorist insanity is all about with the criminal attack on the\nWorld Trade Center - an isolated case, thank goodness.\nWe had reached a clear and elemental disjunction:\neither we stopped the crisis and the terrorism which steadily\nnourished it, or the country would collapse completely. My\nresponsibility was to govern, not to serve as Peru\u2019s undertaker.\nOur anti-terrorist strategy has led to the reinstatement\nof the principle of authority throughout the country,\nparticularly in places as dissimilar as state universities and\npenitentiaries.\nAfter being captured a year ago, Abimael Guzm\u00e1n\nmade a fiery proclamation to all his followers to continue\nrelentlessly the war against the Peruvian State and its\nsociety. Today, in a 180-degree turn, he appeals to your\nspeaker, the President of Peru, in order to retract his\nprevious atrocious objectives. This shows essentially that he\nhas inevitably come to terms with the total defeat of his\ntotalitarian project.\nIn fact, I recently received a revealing communication\nfrom the leader of Shining Path, Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, who is\nin jail, in which he asked for \\\"a peace agreement\\\". I repeat,\nAbimael Guzm\u00e1n Reynoso has asked the President of Peru\nto talk about a \\\"peace agreement\\\". But a \\\"peace agreement\\\"\nimplies negotiation between two belligerent groups\nconsidered to be equal - equal not only militarily but also\nfrom a moral and ethical standpoint. This is inadmissible,\nfor there can be no negotiations with a genocidal terrorist group -\ndescribed as such by the United Nations itself - whose\nleader, having been captured, tried and sentenced last year\nto life imprisonment, has absolutely no power to negotiate.\nMoreover, there is no correlation of forces between the\nPeruvian State and these criminals that could put them on an\nequal footing. There can be no doubt that it has been\ncompletely recognized that the State, the Armed Forces, the\nNational Police and the people of Peru are prevailing over\nterrorism.\nThe Government of Peru is fully aware of its obligation\nto respect the international principles of the Geneva\nConvention. Nevertheless, it will make no concession in any\nway that would jeopardize the process of restoring peace\ncompletely to Peru. Through the attainment of peace in our\ncountry and the definitive eradication of terrorism, we are\nalso preventing the spread of terrorism to the rest of the\nSouthern Cone of our continent.\nThe Peruvian Government and its people will tirelessly\ncontinue their effort to fight terrorist violence, with or\nwithout requests from the heads of these organizations. If\nthey really wish peace to be achieved as soon as possible,\nthey should immediately and unconditionally stop terrorist\nactions and their methods of propagation, as a preliminary\nstep enabling the Peruvian State to prevent further bloodshed\nand suffering for the Peruvian people and to take the further\nsteps required to facilitate the process by which the\nGovernment will fully consolidate national peace before the\ndate I promised to my fellow citizens, that is, 1995.\nTwenty-five thousand deaths; hundreds of thousands of\nrefugee peasants displaced from their villages; thousands of\nwidows and orphans; hundreds of handicapped and maimed,\nincluding civilian, police and military; thousands of children\nwho have grown up in the middle of a cruel war; $25 billion\nof material waste; an entire country paralysed by terror and\nuncertainty: this is the sum of 13 fateful years, during\nwhich a State considered to be democratic appeared not to\nexist in the face of totalitarian terror. The end of this\nvicious circle is approaching after 17 months - barely 17 months -\nof the counter-terrorist strategy developed by my\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nGovernment. Now we can talk about the State and\ndemocracy in Peru.\nIn our country, a new and exemplary democracy is\nbeing devised. It has some unusual elements: the common\nman\u2019s awareness of his chronic exclusion from the\nmainstream of civic life; his experience and sacrifice as a\nsurvivor of one of the century\u2019s worst economic crises; and\nhis equally successful involvement in the war against the\nnation\u2019s terrorist threat - within the framework of the full\nexercise of his right to self-defence and the universal rights\nof the individual and of every citizen.\nPeru can once again see the light of day. The\nnightmare of war is now behind us. Those who doubted that\nthis was possible must now admit that it has happened and\nmust recognize that the decisions taken in April 1992 were\nabsolutely necessary. Peru is beginning to be a viable\ncountry again - an attractive country visited by thousands of\ntourists, who can confidently bear witness to its new look,\na country with hope, one into which foreign capital is\nflowing, thereby generating more employment and wealth.\nIn the near future, the Peruvian people will have the historic\nopportunity to decide upon a constitution incorporating the\nthoroughgoing reforms that will guarantee peace and\nprogress in our country. This will be the end of a grim\ncycle. Peru is now a country open to the world - one which,\nlike other countries all over the planet, is beginning fully to\nexercise its right to be a free and prosperous nation through\nthe implementation of a true democracy and of a system of\ngovernment that will benefit our people.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, Sir, to offer\nyou, and the Republic of Guyana, sincere congratulations on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. This session is taking place at a\nmoment of world history which everyone agrees to be\nexceptional, so it is particularly important that it be as\nsuccessful as possible. The fact that you are guiding its\nwork encourages me to hope that it will be so.\nLet me also take this opportunity to express my\ngratitude for the contribution of the former Foreign Minister\nof the Republic of Bulgaria, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\nGanev, as President of the Assembly at its forty-seventh\nsession.\nThe very presence of Slovenia as an independent State\nand a Member of the United Nations is adequate testimony\nto the fact that the world has fundamentally changed.\nTogether with a series of other countries that are either\nnewly founded or have disengaged themselves from the\nshackles of limited sovereignty - or both simultaneously -\nSlovenia was not, of course, only an object of those changes,\nbut a protagonist in them. The motive force for these\nchanges was the democratic aspirations of nations, their\ndemocratic movements and prominent individuals from all\nspheres of social life. Many of the basic principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, especially the principle of respect\nfor human rights, motivated the democratic movements in\ntheir struggle for political and economic change.\nWe should not forget that fact today as we watch the\nprocesses under way in the part of the world formerly\nknown as the East. The tragic events which we perceive as\nhaving resulted from those very changes should not blur the\nmemories of the movement for the freedom and dignity of\nmen and women as individuals and as members of\nhistorically, culturally and linguistically defined entities. The\ndifficulties faced by the new democracies were expected.\nYet they are strengthening democratic institutions and the\neffectiveness of democratic mechanisms. On the other hand,\nin another - the smaller -part of the East, there is an orgy of\ndestructive violence caused by inconceivable hatred.\nThe old terminology, transferred to the notion of\n\\\"countries of the former East\\\", obstructs a real understanding\nof current events in the part of the world to which it refers.\nIdeological notions should be replaced by terminology that\nrespects the cultural and historical characteristics of\nindividual regions, which in recent history all known politics\nand ideologies have tried to obliterate.\nThe former socialist countries that earlier on had\ndeveloped democracy movements are now experiencing\nsecure democratic development. On the other hand, in those\ncountries with totalitarian regimes that were suddenly\nconfronted with the end of the bipolar world and where\ndemocratic movements were barely incipient, the ensuing\nideological vacuum led to nationalism accompanied by\nexpansionism and grave violations of human rights and of\nthe rights of minorities. Former Yugoslavia, a typical multi-\nethnic State, a federation composed of six different\nterritorially defined members, experienced the consequences\nof these distinctions within its former borders, and for that\nreason could not survive.\nEvery region has its own particular characteristics.\nRespecting them would to a great extent facilitate\nstabilization and the prospects of peaceful development on\nthe basis of multilateral cooperation. It is not just for\nEurope in the wider sense that this is valid, although it is\ntrue that the processes of change are most pronounced in this\nregion, for better or for worse. The changes I am referring\nto put seriously to the test most of the principles of\ninternational cooperation and most of the mechanisms\ncreated to enhance it. The right to self-determination is a\ncase in point. This right, on the one hand, was denied to\nsome nations while on the other hand the misuse of the same\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11\nprinciple for carrying out aggressive expansionism and\nland-grabs has been tolerated.\nThe role of the United Nations has greatly increased\nsince the end of the cold war, and the Organization is\nconfronted with a number of issues that have to be tackled\nin a new way commensurate to the new atmosphere. Now\nit is more or less clear to everybody that we cannot do\nwithout new concepts and new mechanisms within this\nOrganization to enable it to react in accordance with the\nrequirements of the time. It is of crucial importance to\nstrengthen human rights and democracy within countries and\nto reflect this equally in their interrelations.\nThere are great expectations that the United Nations\nwill face these issues and will be able to adapt itself\nefficiently. In order to do this the General Assembly should\nmake proposals in this regard. Let me mention some of the\nfields that these proposals could embrace.\nInternational law needs a further evolution of\nsubstantive provisions and consensual mechanisms for their\nimplementation. The principle of non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of States should be reaffirmed, though it\nshould be sensibly qualified by adequate internationally\ndefined standards. International cooperation and the\ninterdependence of all States are continuously diminishing\nthe scope of matters which are essentially within the\ndomestic jurisdiction of States, while the scope of legitimate\ninternational action is being expanded. In this context there\nappears to be an opportunity for further protection of human\nrights, the rights of ethnic minorities and the environment.\nThe Conference on Human Rights which took place in\nVienna last June confirmed global standards of respect for\nand protection of human rights and recommended the\nestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights.\nSlovenia intends to submit during this session proposals for\nenhancing the activities of the United Nations in the field of\nhuman rights, strengthening the Centre for Human Rights\nand the establishment of a high commissioner for human\nrights.\nEconomic cooperation is of particular importance.\nCooperation in the framework of a series of existing\ninternational organizations and integrations must be seen in\nthe context of its extension to new members. Agreements\non economic cooperation between members and\nnon-members of trading blocs are already being concluded,\nalthough sometimes too slowly. In any case, it is important\nthat these associations should not close the door to the new\ndemocracies, since this could greatly impede the\ndevelopment of market economies in the new democracies\nat the very start. It is to be hoped that regional Economic\nCommissions, specialized agencies of the United Nations and\ninternational financial institutions will use their influence in\norder to help remove obstacles.\nAt the Earth Summit in Rio last year we took part in\nthe efforts for closer international cooperation on the\nenvironment. We will render all possible support to the\nUnited Nations to achieve the aims of the Rio Conference,\nincluding sustainable development, and to simultaneously\ndetect new problems in this field. Of course, success will\nelude us if there is no adequate supervision or sanctions.\nEuropean security since the end of the cold war has\nacquired different faces, and new countries have entered the\nEuropean scene. Some military arrangements with purported\ndefence aims have disbanded, and a number of countries are\nlooking for new arrangements to safeguard their security.\nThis represents an opportunity that should not be lost.\nEurope should be able to fill the security vacuum with\ndemocratic, forward-looking and adequate security\narrangements for all, the more so since it is the first time in\nhistory that security is not bound to increased defence\nspending. This is encouraging. On the other hand, we are\nfacing the danger of new outbreaks in different regions.\nThis situation, more than anything else, requires preventive\ndiplomacy, which should, by its very nature, be a matter of\ncoordination for the United Nations, whose views should be\nformed in the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nExisting security associations, such as the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Western European\nUnion (WEU) should be systematically extended, and care\nshould be taken to see that there is coordination between\nthem and decision-making institutions of the United Nations.\nThe agreement between the United Nations and the CSCE\nsigned in May this year is encouraging from this point of\nview. It may be useful to seriously consider creating forces\nfor rapid action, wherever timely action firmly authorized by\nthe Security Council could prevent a crisis.\nDuring the last two years Slovenia has radically and\nunilaterally restricted its own military potential. More than\nhalf of the military facilities of the former Yugoslav army on\nSlovenian territory have been committed to civilian needs.\nHowever, the Republic of Slovenia remains subject to the\narms embargo which the Security Council imposed on the\nformer Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, this measure did not\nproduce the desired effect in other parts of the former\nYugoslavia; on the contrary, it has prevented the victims of\naggression from effectively defending themselves. It is our\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nview that it is high time the Security Council reconsidered\nthis measure and adjusted it to realities.\nI am sure that I am not alone in the view that all the\nnew dilemmas that the world is facing also require reform of\nthe structures and mechanisms of the United Nations. The\nGeneral Assembly should more fully utilize its own\ncompetence in this sense for dealing with situations and take\nsteps to settle international relations matters. The Security\nCouncil, in view of the new circumstances in the world and\nthe nature of current problems, would appear to need some\nmodification so as to be able to react more flexibly and\neffectively. It would be wise to increase its membership\nappropriately to make it more representative and to\nstrengthen its responsibility to United Nations Member States\nthrough the General Assembly. Further, strengthening the\nprofessional competence of the Secretariat could be\nenvisaged, thereby improving conditions for the effective\noperation of the Secretary-General. The current state of the\nworld, in which we are simultaneously confronted with\npossible dangerous consequences of otherwise welcome\nchanges and with the well-known mounting problems of\ndeveloping countries, of course demands increased efficiency\nof existing and perhaps new mechanisms. This means that\nit will also be impossible to avoid the question of settling the\nregular financing of the United Nations.\nIn closing I must unfortunately also touch on a matter\nthat has already disturbed and concerned the international\ncommunity for far too long: the crisis in some parts of the\nformer Yugoslavia. Slovenia, despite being near the regions\nof armed conflict in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nhas not been directly involved in the problems that have\nbeen the cause of armed conflict for the last two years. This\ndoes not, of course, mean that people of Slovenia and the\nSlovene Government are indifferent. The Republic of\nSlovenia is respecting sanctions and is cooperating in all\nefforts by the international community to bring peace to\nthese countries. We have submitted proposals in order to\nalleviate the crisis, find a political solution and cut short the\nwar and suffering. Unfortunately, the war still rages on.\nWe are constantly reminded of this by the presence of\n70,000 refugees living in Slovenia. Caring for them is no\nsmall burden for the 2 million inhabitants of Slovenia, even\nthough we have the cooperation of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees. However, international aid for\nrefugees is decreasing.\nIn our view, it is crucial to abide by all the principles\non which the international order after the end of cold war\nshould be based. This would encourage the newly founded\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia to follow these principles\nand, like other States founded on the territory of the former\nYugoslavia, to seek membership in the United Nations in\naccordance with the Charter. The political and economic\ninterests of all members of the former Yugoslavia can begin\nto be met only through negotiations, on an equal legal\nfooting, on the succession of the former Yugoslavia.\nSlovenia supports, and will continue to support, all\ninitiatives to create a better world that provides adequate\nprospects for the coming generations - a world based on the\nmutual interests of the entire international community,\nwithout the horrors of war, poverty and social distress, a\nworld in which human rights and the dignity of every\nindividual are standards respected by all Governments.\nI wish the General Assembly every success at the\ncurrent session in its work towards this goal.\n"

Lithuania, with a long tradition of statehood dating\nback to the thirteenth century, regained its independence\nthrough the determination of our people, certain fundamental\nchanges in the world and international support.\nOur State is consolidating democracy. It respects\nhuman and minority rights, and strives to ensure social\nprogress and an improved standard of living founded on free\nmarket principles. By participating in the activities of the\nUnited Nations and other international organizations, we\nhope to contribute to a better world.\nWe have an opportunity to voice our concerns and to\nobtain support not only at the United Nations, but also at the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\nthe Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation\nCouncil and other international organizations. In\nestablishing friendly relations with other countries, Lithuania\nhas felt the supportive and increasing influence of\ninternational organizations in the process of democratization\nand in the creation of a free market economy. We trust that\nthe following international Conferences sponsored by the\nUnited Nations - the International Conference on Population\nand Development, the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment and the Fourth World Conference on Women\n- will help us find lasting solutions to these concerns.\nSince parliamentary elections held last autumn the\nGovernment in Lithuania has changed. Our chosen course\nin foreign policy, however, in the tradition of democratic\nStates, has not altered. Our foreign policy priorities remain\nclose cooperation with the other Baltic States of Latvia and\nEstonia, as well as with the countries of northern Europe,\nand full integration into Europe\u2019s political, economic,\nsecurity and cultural sphere.\nLithuania is seeking in particular friendly and mutually\nbeneficial relations with neighbouring Russia, Poland and\nBelarus. Lithuania supports President Boris Yeltsin\u2019s efforts\nto stabilize the political situation in his country and to\nmaintain the course of reform. We are essentially in full\nagreement with the position of other democratic States\nregarding recent events in Russia.\nLike its other neighbours, Lithuania is seeking its place\non the new map of Europe, and we hope for closer\ncooperation between the countries of the Baltic Sea region.\nAn important aspect of such cooperation, and of Lithuania\u2019s\nrelations with Russia, is our relationship with the\nKaliningrad region. The gradual demilitarization of that\nregion, the development of a free trade zone there and the\nincreased influence that international organizations,\nespecially the European Community, have on its future are\nin Lithuania\u2019s best interest and, we believe, in the interests\nof other States in the area.\nIn the long term, the shores of the Baltic Sea should be\nfree of armaments. Measures should be taken now to\nincrease trust and security. Our chosen path - a gradual\ncoming together of the nations and States of the Baltic\nregion and good relations between neighbours - should lead\nus to the European Community and contribute to the\nconsolidation of security on the old continent.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe shortest road from Paris, Berlin and Warsaw to\nMoscow and St. Petersburg leads through Lithuania. For\nmany centuries, however, the vehicles of war of attacking or\nretreating armies rolled across these crossroads, bringing\nwith them many misfortunes and tragedies. Today, however,\nwe hope that convoys of goods will roll across our territory.\nWe believe, and are working to ensure, that our complex\ngeopolitical situation in a new Europe - a Europe no longer\ntorn apart by antagonistic ideologies - should become a\nsource of new opportunities, benefits and prosperity. We are\ninspired by the example of countries such as Denmark,\nSwitzerland, Austria and others, which have successfully\ntaken advantage of similar situations and the opportunities\noffered by a more unified Europe.\nHaving restored its independence, Lithuania has once\nagain become a participant in the processes of a more\nunified Europe. Lithuania is receptive to cooperation with\nthe West and the East, and sees future opportunities in such\ncooperation.\nDespite the great distances that separate us, relations\nwith the United States have been, and will continue to be,\nespecially significant for Lithuania. We are grateful to the\nUnited States for resolutely adhering to the policy of\nnon-recognition of the illegal incorporation of Lithuania into\nthe Soviet Union. A sizeable emigr\u00e9 community, which\nfound refuge in the new world, links our two countries. We\nvalue close United States cooperation with Europe, including\nthat with the structures of the CSCE and the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization, and we sincerely wish every success for\nefforts to stabilize the situation in a changing world and to\nencourage the progress of post-Communist countries toward\ndemocracy and a free market.\nWe turn to the United Nations, asking it to safeguard\nthe interests of small States. The future of a more integrated\nworld lies in democracy and in the individuality of free\nnations. The international community should be prepared to\ndefend, with force if necessary, the sovereignty of small -\neven the smallest - nations. During his recent visit to\nLithuania, Pope John Paul II stressed that\n\\\"the interests of large States should never force small\nStates to become satellites of a foreign Power\\\".\nIn spite of the conflicts that now plague the world, it is\nfortunate that some good news also reaches this house in\nNew York. We welcome the peace processes in the Middle\nEast and the positive trends in South Africa, Cambodia,\nHaiti and El Salvador.\nOn 31 August, in compliance with General Assembly\nresolution 47/21 of 1992, the last remaining units of the\nRussian army were withdrawn from Lithuania. I should like\nto take this opportunity to thank representatives from all the\ncountries, large and small, that supported our legitimate goal.\nI should also like to sincerely thank the United Nations and\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who monitored the\nfulfilment of the obligation to withdraw that army, and who,\nduring the most critical moments, sent his envoy,\nAmbassador Tommy Koh, to Vilnius, and Mr. Stoyan\nGanev, President of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, who visited Lithuania and the other Baltic States\nin July to discuss the army\u2019s withdrawal. We were glad\nwhen, having made it just in time for the ceremony marking\nthe departure of the last Russian troops, Ambassador Koh\nsaid:\n\\\"My work in Lithuania is done, although some work is\nwaiting for me in the other Baltic States.\\\"\nWhen a large State withdraws its army from a small\none without issuing any ultimatums or setting conditions,\nthis signals a new era for the world in which, thanks to\ninternational efforts in accordance with the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, even the most sensitive problems\ncan be solved peacefully. Despite several disagreements that\narose at the last minute, calm and balanced diplomacy\nallowed Lithuania and Russia to reach agreement on this\nfundamental question.\nOn more than one occasion I had the pleasure of\nspeaking openly and sincerely with President Boris Yeltsin\nof the Russian Federation. A fresh page is being turned in\nthe relations between our two countries. Of course, the issue\nof compensation for damage inflicted during the years of\noccupation is still on the agenda for negotiations between\nLithuania and Russia.\nThe Russian army still remains in Estonia and Latvia.\nWe believe that with the help of the United Nations this\ninternational problem will be resolved successfully and, at\nthe same time, the stability of the region will be bolstered.\nUntil people become fully aware of the possibilities that\ndemocracy and freedom provide these ideas will remain just\nthat - ideas. After an initial wave of euphoria, disillusion\nmay follow. One can already notice this in some post-\ncommunist countries. This causes me, as President of\nLithuania, great concern. I do not think that the world\ncommunity can afford to remain indifferent to this problem.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15\nA democratic and civic State, based on the rule of law,\nin which people are not segregated according to their\nnationality or religious and political beliefs, is being\nestablished in Lithuania. There is no tension in our country\nbetween Lithuanians and ethnic minorities. We are\nreforming and stabilizing the Lithuanian economy; we are\nsearching for ways to provide at least minimal social welfare\nguarantees; as much as possible we are trying to clear the\nway for private initiative. We cannot, however, change our\neconomy overnight. The Lithuanian people are patient and\nindustrious, working hard for their well-being and future.\nHowever, disillusion with democracy and the free market\nwould be disastrous.\nTherefore I wish to speak very frankly to this body:\neven though we feel the concern and support of the world\ncommunity, that is not enough. It appears that even the\nmost authoritative international organizations lack the\ncoordinated action and initiative for truly effective\nassistance. We occasionally feel isolationist tendencies on\nthe part of the most industrialized nations; having attained a\nhigh standard of living, they attempt to dissociate themselves\nfrom the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. This\ngreatly complicates the future of these countries as they\nattempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic,\npolitical, psychological, cultural and historical problems that\nthey have inherited from the recent past. In most\npost-communist countries there still prevails a nostalgia for\nthe past, when authoritarian government guaranteed people\ntheir minimum needs, albeit at the expense of their freedom.\nWithout timely and joint efforts, this nostalgia for a\npseudo-socialistic past could cause the development of\ncertain countries to follow a course that would be\nunacceptable to all of us.\nFor several years now, both in Europe and North\nAmerica, the idea of a new \\\"Marshall Plan\\\" has been in the\nair, but it has in no way materialized. Yet investments in\nthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe - and I have in\nmind not only financial investments - would really be\ninvestments in all of our futures. Greater and more effective\nassistance for the democratic forces in post-communist States\nwould help decisively to rid the world of the remnants of\ntotalitarianism and dictatorship that have so tormented\nmankind in the twentieth century.\nWith the dissolution of two hostile blocs, the world has\nbecome a safer place. However, that does not solve all the\nsecurity problems that mankind now faces. Indeed, the\nnumber of such problems has increased. There is now a\ngreater possibility of localized conflicts: they have flared up\nin precisely those places where dictatorships that suppressed\nnations have fallen. Such horrendous practices as \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" must be severely condemned. The model of an\nabsolutely closed nation-State is no longer a viable one for\nthe solution of separate national problems.\nThe Lithuanian people respect the struggle of nations\nfor their freedom, but they condemn atrocities which occur\nunder the guise of a noble cause. The tragedy of what was\nformerly Yugoslavia is truly horrible. We approve of the\nmeans that the United Nations uses to uphold peace and\nsecurity, but too often resolution of the structure of a State\nand border issues are left to warring countries to decide by\nforce of arms. In the future the United Nations should\npursue even more actively preventive diplomacy to stop\nconflicts before they erupt. Every illegal and violent act\nrequires a response, not appeasement.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" is a\nwelcome plan that provides a solid foundation. What should\nthe new role of the United Nations be in an ever-changing\nworld? As I see it, in future the Organization must not only\nbe a guarantor of security, but also an instigator of economic\ndevelopment and a global defender of human and ethnic\nminority rights. At the Vienna Conference on Human\nRights, we spoke out in favour of establishing the post of\nhigh commissioner for human rights. At this time, ideas\nabout the sovereignty of States, the self-determination of\nnations, national security and the maintenance and\nenforcement of peace are changing rapidly. The individual\nproblems of individual States are becoming global in scope,\nespecially in the areas of environmental protection, refugees,\nnarcotics and organized crime. For precisely that reason,\ncooperation among neighbouring States is growing in\nimportance.\nRegional interaction is broadening and the role of\ninternational organizations is being extended. We approve\nof regional structures and arrangements that help to\nguarantee peace and stability in their respective regions.\nHowever, their activities should be linked with United\nNations supervision, so that large and powerful nations do\nnot transform such regional structures into instruments of\ndomination. I am referring to failed States. They need\ninternational assistance that would not force upon them the\nprotectorate of another State or provide conditions for\nassimilating them into some sort of sphere of influence, but\nwould respect and protect their sovereignty and\nindependence. Small countries have a right to rely on a firm\nguarantee of security. The United Nations could and should\nbecome that guarantee. In the long-term future, as\ndemocracy and cooperation become firmly established\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthroughout our planet, the United Nations would perhaps\nassume certain functions of a world government.\nI reiterate my support for Lithuania\u2019s proposal, which\nwas outlined here at the United Nations exactly one year\nago, that new permanent members could be added to the\nSecurity Council. For the United Nations to achieve its\nobjective, it is important to continue and even expand the\nsystem reforms that are now being put into effect to increase\ncost-efficiency. We welcome the initiatives by several\ncountries, among them the United States, to establish more\ndependable internal and external inspection machinery. The\nsuggested creation of an office of inspector-general could\nhelp to assure Member States that the mandates that we have\nprovided for various programmes are put to the most\neffective use possible.\nI should like to state clearly that the current financial\ncrisis of the United Nations is of great concern to Lithuania.\nWe are not indifferent to it. Lithuania is firmly resolved to\nfulfil its obligations to the Organization and it has\ndemonstrated its readiness to do so. Lithuania could support\nthe activities of the Organization even more strongly if for\nthree years now we had not been forced repeatedly to\ndiscuss the difficult problem of assessments with regard to\nthe United Nations budget. Our delegation, along with other\ncountries that have found themselves in a similar situation,\nhas on more than one occasion suggested ways in which this\nproblem could be solved. I wish to emphasize that the\nposition of Lithuania remains unchanged. The scale of\nassessments must be determined on the basis of statistical\ndata provided by each State, in accordance with its capacity\nto pay and, most important, abiding by the principle that the\nsame methodology for calculating assessments must be\napplied to all States equally. In seeking to ensure these\nprinciples and finally to resolve this problem, we are\nprepared to exchange ideas with, and we hope for the\ncooperation of, all delegations.\nI reiterate my support for Lithuania\u2019s proposal, made\nhere at the United Nations exactly a year ago, that new\npermanent members could be added to the Security Council.\nLithuania not only supports peace-keeping efforts, but would\nlike eventually to become a contributor to military and\ncivilian operations.\nWhen Lithuania became a member of the Council of\nEurope I suggested a meeting of all the Heads of State of\npost-communist countries. This would not be an attempt to\ncreate some sort of new bloc or to console each other about\nour economic hardships. Such a conference, under the\nauspices of the Council of Europe or perhaps some other\norganization, could provide an opportunity to discuss in a\ndown-to-earth way how to recover more quickly from the\nmaladies of national egoism and ethnocentricity that may be\nunavoidable in young States and fragile democracies. All of\nus in post-communist countries should, as quickly as\npossible, learn how to cooperate among ourselves and with\nthe rest of the world and strive to be better full-fledged\nmembers of our planet\u2019s democratic community. Other\ncountries have learned the art of cooperation over decades.\nWe have not had that much time. It is very important that\nwe succeed through a joint effort in making this period as\nbrief as possible.\nWe welcome the initiative by some Members of the\nUnited Nations to establish a forum for new and restored\ndemocracies. It is our sincere hope that this movement,\nbegun in the Philippines, will help bring developing\ncountries and countries in transition closer together, so that\nthey may reach common approaches down the path to\ndemocracy and a free market.\nThe spirit of the approaching twenty-first century\nalready fills this Hall. At the turn of the third millennium\nmankind is faced with critical global problems that threaten\nits very existence: ecological, social and spiritual problems\nand the nuclear threat, which has not yet been abolished.\nNational and regional problems seem to pale in comparison,\nbut I do not think that that is really the case. Every step\ntowards progress, even if taken in a small country or with\nregard to improved relations between two States, diminishes\nthe possibility of global conflict, and vice versa. I should\ntherefore like to believe that the withdrawal of the Russian\nmilitary from Lithuania was an achievement for more than\njust two countries. The entire world became somewhat\nbetter, somewhat more just, and the threat that hung over it\nwas abated.\nI think that there will be more and more such successes.\nThe United Nations system contributes, and will continue to\ncontribute, significantly to their attainment.\n"

        "file_text": "I too would like to extend to Ambassador\nInsanally the congratulations of Seychelles on his election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. We wish him\nevery possible success in carrying out his duties.\nAllow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the\nSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in seeking solutions\nto the many problems facing the international community.\nOur session is opening on a note of hope, because it is\ntaking place only a few days after a historic event of\nexceptional importance. I am referring, of course, to the\nsigning of the peace agreement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization. May that negotiation\nprovide a lesson in those areas where misunderstanding,\nhatred and conflicts of interest are still bringing suffering to\nso many.\nThe dramatic events and the human tragedy that are\ntaking place in hotbeds of tension throughout the world are\na credit to no one. However, we must take note of the fact\nthat while reaction has been passive and hesitant in some\ncases, it has been quick and resolute in others.\nThe quest for peace is nevertheless at the centre of our\nconcerns. The considerable financial resources our\nOrganization devotes to peace-keeping missions or missions\nto restore peace demonstrate this. This is undoubtedly proof\nof our own determination to bring to a halt these conflicts,\nwhich result in so many victims and destroy all the\nachievements of development.\nIndeed, any lasting development necessarily implies\nefforts to thwart the threat of certain situations turning into\nopen conflict.\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nFor us island States, the seas are a source of life. Our\nfuture depends mainly on them. And for our development\nto be truly lasting, we must have peace on the seas.\nWhile it is indisputable that old rivalries have subsided\nin the seas and oceans of the world, it nevertheless remains\ntrue that the Indian Ocean has always been coveted by all.\nAnd that is why we reiterate our request that the Indian\nOcean become truly a zone of peace and cooperation to the\nbenefit of coastal States. The concept of the Colombo\nConference is perhaps something from a bygone era, but its\nobjectives remain relevant today.\nMembers will find it easy to understand, therefore, why\nwe attach such great importance to the implementation of\nresolution 47/59 of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly calling for the organization by the Ad Hoc\nCommittee of a meeting that would propose new alternative\napproaches leading to the achievement of the goals contained\nin the initial Declaration, taking into account the changing\ninternational situation.\nIt is in this spirit that I should like to make an appeal\nto the countries which have not yet done so to ratify the\nConvention on the Law of the Sea so that we can get the\nnecessary 60 ratifications for its entry into force. How are\nwe to understand that such an important Convention has\nbeen endorsed by only 56 countries since 1982? Of course,\nwe do appreciate the importance of what is at stake, but\ninternational solidarity must be our guide.\nThe International Olympic Committee would like to\nrevive the ancient tradition of the Olympic truce and declare\n1994 the International Year of Sports and of the Olympic\nSpirit, and we should support that proposal. Let us not\nunderestimate the values of the Olympic spirit. They are\nrich in potential applications for managing international\nrelations.\nBut no peace can be lasting while the causes of\nconflicts remain. These causes are selfishness, intolerance,\nxenophobia, discrimination and dictatorship, but also - and\nespecially - poverty, poor management and excessive\nindebtedness. These are ills that generally lead to the\nemergence of new conflicts. Should we not attack the root\ncause rather than the effect?\nA few years ago, financial backers made\ndemocratization one of the prerequisites for assistance to\ndeveloping countries, and as a bonus to democracy, certain\ncountries benefited from the generosity of the international\ncommunity because they had pioneered that approach.\nToday, most of our countries have embarked on the process\nof democratization - with varied results, admittedly - but the\ndesire to fit into the new order was the underlying reason for\nall. Nevertheless, this new process, and I would take the\ncase of the Republic of Seychelles, which has met this\nchallenge calmly and successfully, inevitably entailed\nextrabudgetary expenditures in all areas, both economic and\nsocial.\nWhile it is true that the transition to democracy is\nsomething which is very valuable in and of itself, the\nestablishment of new structures and the implementation of\nnew rules have nevertheless been a source of additional costs\nwhich have placed a heavy burden on national budgets that\nwere already fairly shaky. And almost everywhere, the\nimplementation of this democratization process required the\nsupport of the international community. Is this not an\nobjective reason to think about setting up a United Nations\nspecial fund to provide financial and logistical support for\nthese reforms?\nTo be viable, this democratic undertaking must seek to\nmeet all the challenges of a country. If it is to ensure the\ncontinuation of these new institutions, it must pave the way\nfor sustainable development commensurate with the\naspirations of peoples.\nThus, with the advent of the Third Republic, our\ncountry is today in a new stage of its history. For more than\n18 months, within the context of a constituent commission,\nreforms have been undertaken that will produce a new\nConstitution and lead to free and democratic elections. In\nother words, for a year and a half national activity has been\nslowed, and even brought to a halt in some cases, while the\nfundamental economic problems remain.\nThe Seychelles has been the scene of another\nmomentous event, the Fourth Indian Ocean Games, which\ntook place last August in conditions that were judged\nexceptional. Reverting to what I was saying, I would note\nthat the cost of the infrastructure for those Games made\nserious inroads into the national budget.\nOne might wonder how a small island country was able\nto engage in such a programme of reforms for 18 months in\nsuch circumstances. We are proud of having succeeded, but\nthe economy must be restimulated immediately if we do not\nwish to lose all the social and political benefits that were\nachieved.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 43\nI should like now to take up the problem of the small\nisland States, of whose fragility everyone here is aware. We\nare countries whose reduced size is the source of\ninnumerable constraints on economic and social\ndevelopment, such as chronic deficits in trade balances and\nbalances of payment, the high cost of social infrastructures\nin relation to their utilization and, especially, the excessive\nindebtedness caused by a lack of funds to finance investment\nprogrammes. The convergence of those factors has only\nexacerbated the fragility of our economies, which, generally\nspeaking, are based on one or two sectors such as tourism\nand fishing.\nThat is the daily lot of the Seychelles and other small\nisland States, which, with courage, perseverance and\nintelligence, are nevertheless attempting to find solutions that\nwill enable them to promote the economic and social well-\nbeing of their peoples. Thus we believe that it is quite\nfitting to draw the international community\u2019s attention once\nagain to the need to establish specific programmes and\nmechanisms that would make it possible for our island\ncountries to move towards sustainable development. We ask\nthat the same facilities that are made available to the least\ndeveloped, landlocked countries be made available to us.\nIn any event, per capita income, always put forward as\na criterion for level of development, cannot be relevant for\nsmall island States because it is distorted by the small size\nof their populations. Has any thought been given to the per\ncapita cost of infrastructures or the per capita debt? We\nbelieve that such an analysis would result in the\nreconsideration of many decisions.\nOf course, it is up to us, first of all, to take every\nmeasure to ensure the sustainability of our development by\npreserving, in so far as possible, our environment, which lies\nat the basis of all our export products. Despite all these\nconstraints, we have been able - thanks to the judiciousness\nof our choices and our economic decisions -\nto achieve tangible results. But the international\ncommunity\u2019s support, which we had been promised in Rio,\ndid not materialize.\nToday, all of the developing countries are in a\nprecarious situation. They are confronted with many\nchallenges: the poverty of millions of human beings, high\nrates of infant mortality, famine, the destruction of the\nenvironment and fratricidal wars. But these challenges are\nnot insurmountable. What is required is courage and\ninternational solidarity.\nIt is more than ever the duty of the United Nations\nonce again to draw the attention of the developed countries\nto the effects which the continuation of such a situation\nmight have on our economies and our cultures - in a word,\non our future, but also on theirs.\nWe would like concrete action, because we do not wish\nto have to deplore again the inertia of speeches or\ndeclarations of intent. While new conflicts arise, the old\nones persist almost everywhere and the scope of the disasters\nis tremendous. Hence, we must react quickly, because many\npeoples have suffered far too much from the horrors of war.\nAbove all, the major Powers, the guarantors of the\nsecurity and regulation of the world economic situation, must\ngive the United Nations the means to carry out its policies.\nFinally, we sincerely hope that the current session will\ngenerate the necessary impetus to resolve all our concerns,\nso that peace, at last restored, can create a climate conducive\nto development.\n"

We\nshare the grief of the people of India at this sorrowful and\ntragic time.\nI should like to join those representatives who have\nalready congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his\nunanimous election as President of the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations at its forty-eighth session. His election\nto this high office is a demonstration of the confidence that\nthe Member States have in him and of their respect for his\ncountry, Guyana. We are confident that, under his wise\nguidance, our deliberations in this session will achieve the\ndesired results.\nI also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Insanally\u2019s\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for steering the\nforty-seventh session to a successful conclusion.\nWe commend the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, too for the skilful and competent\nmanner in which he is directing the Organization.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to congratulate the\nMembers that were admitted to the Organization during the\npast year. Their admission strengthens the ideal of the\nuniversality of the United Nations. We assure them of our\nwillingness to work closely with them in our common efforts\nto create a better world.\nThe end of the cold war created an unprecedented\nopportunity to increase international cooperation with a view\nto achieving international peace and security and promoting\nthe socio-economic progress envisaged in the United Nations\nCharter. However, the new challenges emerging on the\nglobal scene demand that the international community\nsummon up the will and imagination to overcome them.\nThe disappearance of the great ideological rivalry\nbetween East and West has resulted in a sense of soberness\nand improvement in relations between States. It has also led\nto a reduction in tensions and to significant progress in the\narea of disarmament, thereby creating opportunities for the\nconversion of massive resources to peaceful uses.\nPeace and security, however, is not merely the absence\nof war or the threat of war; it is the absence of conditions\nthat threaten the enjoyment of life and social harmony. The\nUnited Nations now has an opportunity to put fully into\neffect the system of security envisaged in its Charter. This\nsystem is based on the principles of the peaceful settlement\nof disputes and collective action in pursuit of international\npeace and the maintenance of global security. Equally\nimportant, the world has an opportunity to build pillars of\npeace by tackling sources of instability in the economic,\nsocial, humanitarian and ecological fields.\nThe brutal war in Bosnia, the destruction of Somalia\nand the protracted civil wars in Angola and elsewhere\nconfirm the futility of the use of force as a means of solving\ndisputes.\nThe ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty\n(START I) by the Governments of the United States of\nAmerica and the Russian Federation and their signing of the\nSTART II Agreements in January 1993 are significant\ndevelopments in disarmament. The primary responsibility\nfor nuclear disarmament rests with those States that possess\nthe nuclear arsenals. Kenya, however, strongly believes that\nthe international community as a whole must be involved\nand should contribute to measures intended to achieve\nnuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of all\nweapons of mass destruction.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 21\nContrary to expectations, the collapse of the bipolar\nworld order has not given way to a new order of peace and\ndemocracy and improved socio-economic situations. The\nemerging order has raised new challenges and new\napproaches to solutions. As Members of the United Nations\nfamily, we need to redouble our efforts with vision and\ndetermination to balance both short- and long-term interests\nas we struggle to shape the new order.\nIn many parts of the world, we are confronted with\nassertions of nationalism coupled with territorial claims. As\nthe Secretary-General puts it in his Agenda for Peace,\n\\\"... the cohesion of States is threatened by brutal ethnic,\nreligious, social, cultural and linguistic strife\\\".\n(A/47/277, para. 11)\nKenya subscribes to the thrust of the Agenda for Peace\nas elaborated during the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, on the basis of which a draft resolution will be\nadopted during this session. The elaboration of the Agenda\nfor Peace should take into account the principles of\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of nation-States.\nThe new approach will widen and deepen the scope of\nthe United Nations in the promotion of the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity. In this regard, Kenya urges the full exploitation of\nthe potential of the International Court of Justice in the\nadjudication of disputes between States as a potential\ntransparent and cost-effective means of conflict resolution.\nThe case of Somalia is particularly distressing. We\nstrongly believe that keeping United Nations peace-keeping\npersonnel in Somalia is critical to the pursuit of peace and\nsecurity in that country. We note with appreciation the\nSecretary-General\u2019s report that, despite several incidences of\nviolence in Mogadishu, there are improvements in the\noverall situation, including eradication of starvation,\nestablishment of a large number of district councils, opening\nof schools and resumption of normal life in most areas of\nthe country.\nWe also welcome Security Council resolution\n865 (1993) of 22 September, by which the Council, inter\nalia, invites the Secretary-General to consult the countries of\nthe region and regional organizations concerned on means of\nfurther reinvigorating the reconciliation process. We believe\nthat the regional peace initiatives can effectively complement\nthe United Nations efforts in facilitating reconciliation\nbetween all the factions in Somalia.\nThe highest priority is to assist the people of Somalia\nin furthering the national reconciliation process and to\npromote and advance the re-establishment of regional and\nnational institutions and civil administration in the entire\ncountry, as set out in Security Council resolution 814 (1993).\nThis requires improvement of the dialogue between the\nUnited Nations personnel in Somalia and the general Somali\npublic as an essential element in confidence-building to\nfacilitate reconciliation between the various factions.\nKenya shares an 800-kilometre-long border with\nSomalia. In many ways, we are extremely exposed to the\nSomalia problem. Somalia is a sister country with which we\nshare family relations as well as ethnic and cultural\naffinities. The very heavy influx of Somali refugees into\nKenya has had a devastating effect on the most ecologically\nfragile parts of the country. The border region has suffered\nserious environmental destruction as a result of excessive\ncutting of trees for building materials and firewood. The\nphysical and social infrastructures have been overstretched\nby excessive usage and overloading.\nMost seriously, our people and security personnel have\nbeen subjected to numerous acts of banditry by armed gangs\ncrossing into Kenya from Somalia, causing general insecurity\nin the border region. We have continued to lose both\ncivilians and security personnel at an unacceptably high rate\nas a result of attacks by bandits. Huge numbers of livestock\nand huge quantities of other property have also been lost to\nthem.\nAs peace is being restored in Somalia, we are\ncooperating with the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees to accelerate the voluntary\nrepatriation of refugees. At the same time, we are\nrequesting the United Nations and the donor community to\nurgently assist Kenya with programmes for the rehabilitation\nof the physical and social infrastructures as well as for the\nrestoration of the ecosystem in the region.\nWe are also requesting the Secretary-General to\nreinforce the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) patrols along the Somali side of the border so\nas to complement the efforts of the Kenyan security\npersonnel on our side. We believe that the joint security\nefforts will significantly scale down the flow of armed gangs\nand individuals into Kenya.\nSudan is another neighbouring country that has for a\nlong time now been suffering devastating civil strife. The\nproblem has been of great concern not only to the\nneighbouring countries but also to the Organization of\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. There is an\nurgent need for the United Nations to support the ongoing\nregional efforts spearheaded by Presidents Yoweri Museveni\nof Uganda, Afwerki of Eritrea and Zenawi of Ethiopia under\nthe chairmanship of President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya.\nWe appeal to all parties involved in the conflict to be\nflexible in the search for a just and lasting solution.\nElsewhere in our continent, efforts to find solutions to\nethnic and other conflicts have shown encouraging trends.\nWe are confident that the people of Mozambique, Rwanda\nand Liberia will realize their dreams of peace through the\nprocess of dialogue. Greater involvement by the United\nNations in the Rwandese peace process is pertinent at this\nstage. It is essential that the peace accords signed in these\ncountries be honoured by all the parties, with effective\nsupport from the United Nations, the OAU and regional\nbodies, and with generous assistance from friendly countries.\nThe situation in Angola is very disturbing. The\nongoing bloodshed could easily have been avoided if the\nUNITA leadership had accepted the verdict of the people in\nthe elections. We appeal to UNITA to agree to a dialogue\nfor a peaceful political solution, with the mediation and\nincreased support of the United Nations, OAU and the\nsponsors of the Peace Accords.\nWe are also greatly encouraged by the developments\nthat have taken place in South Africa. The agreement\nreached for the creation of the Transitional Executive\nCouncil and the setting of a date for the first democratic\nelections pave the way for the establishment of a truly\nnon-racial, democratic South Africa. We support the recent\ncall by Mr. Nelson Mandela, the President of the African\nNational Congress of South Africa (ANC), for all diplomatic\nand economic sanctions against South Africa to be lifted.\nThe recently concluded, momentous agreement between\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) marks\na turning point in the process of finding a just and lasting\nsolution to the Palestinian and, indeed, the Middle East\nproblem. We are encouraged by the assurances that this is\nthe first tangible step towards the establishment of a\nPalestinian State alongside Israel. We wish the Palestinian\nand Israeli people happy and peaceful coexistence.\nFurther afield, we welcome the successful holding of\nthe elections under United Nations auspices in Cambodia,\nthe conclusion of the Governors Island Agreement on the\nrestoration of a democratically elected Government of Haiti,\nand the progress towards the establishment of lasting peace\nin El Salvador.\nThe experience of Somalia and other regional conflicts\nconvinces us that there is an urgent need for the United\nNations to re-evaluate the existing international control\nsystems for conventional-weapon production and trade. The\nwidespread availability of deadly conventional weapons\nconstitutes the most important factor in the prolongation of\nregional and civil conflicts.\nWith its increased responsibilities and challenges, the\nUnited Nations needs to be restructured and revitalized so\nthat it can effectively discharge its responsibilities. It must\nalso be provided with adequate resources. The tasks ahead\ndemand that the energy and attention of all components of\nthe United Nations be engaged fully and appropriately.\nThe General Assembly must be enabled to play its full\nrole in decisions affecting international peace and security.\nThere is a need to establish a balanced relationship between\nthe Assembly and the other principal organs of the United\nNations, and to ensure logical accountability of the principal\norgans, in particular the Security Council.\nThe Security Council must also be reformed so that it\nis more transparent, more representative and more\ndemocratic in its decision-making process, while at the same\ntime its effectiveness is ensured.\nThe ongoing restructuring and revitalization of the\nEconomic and Social Council and the United Nations in the\neconomic, social and related fields should strengthen the\nCouncil and enable it to play a central role in providing\npolicy recommendations to the General Assembly.\nSimilarly, the ongoing efforts to restructure the Secretariat\nmust be balanced and accord appropriate priority to\ndevelopment concerns. Operational activities of the\nOrganization must be provided with adequate resources on\na sustainable basis to enable it effectively to promote\nsocio-economic progress in accordance with its Charter.\nPeace-keeping operations have increasingly become\namong the most utilized and widely acceptable instruments\nof the Organization, especially in discharging its primary\nresponsibility in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. The operations have also increasingly taken on\nnew and broader assignments and responsibilities. Kenya is\nhappy to be closely associated with peace-keeping\noperations. We have contributed military and police\npersonnel to many peace-keeping operations world wide.\nThe enormous rise in the number and scope of\npeace-keeping operations requires that the ability of the\nSecretariat to manage such large-scale operations be\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 23\nstrengthened and also that Member States be ready to\nfinance the operations.\nIn this connection, the serious concerns expressed by\nthe Secretary-General and his urgent appeals to Member\nStates to pay arrears of contributions must receive a concrete\nand speedy response from all the Members of this\nOrganization. The formula for apportioning contributions\nshould reflect the special responsibility of the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council and of other developed\ncountries and take into account the relatively limited\ncapacities of developing countries. A dramatic change in the\nformula of contributions could, I submit, complicate further\nthe problem of arrears. The establishment of the\npeace-keeping reserve fund would go a long way towards\nmaking peace-keeping operations more efficient. In this\nregard, a timely and effective response by the United\nNations will largely depend on the availability of adequate\nresources, at least in the initial stages, to cater for the critical\ntime lost in negotiations for the financing of peace-keeping\noperations. It is also important that a formula be developed\nto establish a more predictable financial basis for the\npeace-keeping operations.\nThe uncertainty prevailing in the world economy today\nis a cause for serious concern. Insufficient growth in the\ndeveloped countries has contributed to the unfavourable\nexternal conditions that threaten the political, economic and\nsocial stability of many developing countries. These include\nrenewed pressures for increased protectionism, falling\ncommodity prices and the decline in financial flows, among\nother conditions. Despite the far-reaching economic and\npolitical reforms which have been put in place by most\nAfrican countries in the last three years, the situation\ncontinues to be grim, since the region continues to\nexperience economic growth of less than 2 per cent. The\ncurrent trends, if not reversed, threaten to marginalize further\nthe participation of African countries in the global economy.\nThe liberalization of the African economies and the\nhard work of the African people are not in themselves\nsufficient to transform the socio-economic situation in\nAfrica. The continent is not playing the international\neconomic game with other continents on a level ground. We\nwish, therefore, to underscore the need for the international\ncommunity to seize the opportunity created by the positive\nchanges taking place on the continent and give Africa real\nsupport so that the gains made for economic and democratic\nreform will be sustainable.\nAt the same time, African countries should continue to\nstrengthen their regional integration efforts within the\nregional bodies already established, such as the Preferential\nTrade Area for the Eastern and Southern African Countries\n(PTA), the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and\nDevelopment (IGADD) in the Horn of Africa, and the\nongoing efforts to revive East African cooperation.\nOur experience in Kenya in implementing structural\nadjustment programmes is that the reforms have inherent\nnegative short-term effects, particularly on the poor and the\nother vulnerable members of society. These include the fall\nin their purchasing power owing to the liberalization of\nprices, job losses through a reduction of manpower in the\npublic sector, and the reduction of government expenditure\non such essential social services as health, education and\nother infrastructures. The donor community needs,\ntherefore, to balance the aid conditionalities with the\nsocio-economic realities obtaining in the countries\nimplementing structural adjustment programmes, particularly\nby addressing the social dimensions of such programmes in\nconcrete and human terms.\nThe United Nations new agenda for the development of\nAfrica in the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its\nforty-sixth session, commits the international community to\nimplement concrete and effective measures to support\nAfrica\u2019s own efforts in the process of economic reforms and\ndevelopment. The success of the implementation of the\nprogramme will depend, first, on the efforts of the African\ncountries themselves and, secondly, on the back-up resources\nfrom multilateral and bilateral donors. We are concerned\nthat these resources are shrinking owing to diversion and\nwhat appears to be a subtle disengagement from Africa.\nThe acute external debt of African countries and the\nheavy and unbearable burden of servicing that debt are\namong the matters on which concrete action is needed. The\nburden of debt-servicing drains the continent of over $10\nbillion annually, thus diverting resources badly needed for\ninvestment and alleviation of poverty.\nOn trade, it is gratifying to note that, after six months\nof stalemate, multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\nhave resumed. We emphasize, however, that the outcome of\nthe negotiations should be balanced to take account of the\nparticular needs of the poor developing countries.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, which was\nheld in Vienna, Austria, in June this year, marked a\nsignificant watershed for the international community on the\nimportant question of human rights. That Conference\nemphasized that human rights are interdependent and\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nindivisible. It recognized development as a basic human\nright. Democracy, development and human rights go hand\nin hand, as experience has shown that it is difficult to\nguarantee some basic rights, especially economic and social\nrights, in situations of abject poverty.\nAs I emphasized in my statement at that Conference,\nthe existing international institutions for human rights need\nstrengthening. At the same time, developing countries\nrequire support and assistance to strengthen their domestic\ninstitutions and build strong foundations for the rule of law\nand the administration of justice.\nSince the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, Governments and international agencies have\nfocused their attention on the implementation of Agenda 21.\nThe first substantive meeting of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, held in June this year, made\ntangible progress in adopting crucial decisions on its work\nprogramme. Kenya welcomes the progress being made\ntowards ensuring the effectiveness of the Global\nEnvironmental Facility as an important instrument for\nfunding incremental costs related to the implementation of\nAgenda 21. However, we are concerned that adequate\nfinancial resources for the implementation of the programme\nhave fallen short of expectations. On institutional\narrangements, while Kenya supports the mandate given to\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development in regard to\nmonitoring progress in the implementation of Agenda 21, the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) must\ncontinue to play a central role owing to the experience and\nexpertise it has accumulated over the years in the area of the\nenvironment. The need to strengthen UNEP to enable it to\nparticipate effectively in the implementation of Agenda 21\ncan therefore not be overemphasized.\nAccordingly, the conference facilities at UNEP\nHeadquarters in Nairobi must be put to full use. It is neither\neconomically sound nor in keeping with the objective of\nstrengthening UNEP to have many meetings initiated by the\nOrganization held outside its Headquarters. As a host\ncountry, Kenya shall continue to provide all the necessary\nassistance to UNEP to enable it to play its central and,\nindeed, its rightful role.\nAs the Secretariat of the United Nations undergoes\nrestructuring, we should be mindful of the mandates of\nvarious agencies and bodies in order to avoid the possibility\nof losing the original objective. Kenya is concerned that the\nrole of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements\n(Habitat), whose Headquarters are in Nairobi, is being\neroded by the undue delay in filling the post of Executive\nDirector, despite the concerns expressed by the General\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session. The filling of the post\nwill give the required impetus to the Habitat secretariat.\nAs to the social issues, I wish to assure members of our\ncooperation with the international community in the\npreparatory work for the forthcoming Conference on\nPopulation and Development, to be held next year; the\nFourth World Conference on Women, also to be held in\n1994; and the World Summit for Social Development, set for\n1995. We need to put all our energies into the preparatory\nwork of these Conferences to ensure that they achieve their\nintended objectives.\nIn conclusion, the international community, through this\nAssembly, must make every effort to face these challenges\nand many more which are yet to come. We owe it to\nposterity and to future generations to leave this world a\nbetter place to live in. We have neither excuses nor reasons\nto fail. And if we do fail, history will judge us harshly. In\nthis endeavour, our differences should strengthen rather than\nweaken us, for in unity lies our strength. In the words of our\nbeloved President, His Excellency Daniel Teroitich Arap\nMoi, love, peace and unity are the pillars for development\nand progress.\n"

On behalf of the Government and\npeople of Cambodia may I offer our profound condolences\nto the Government of India and to the relatives of the\nvictims.\nIt is a privilege and an honour for me to address the\nGeneral Assembly at their forty-eighth session as the First\nPrime Minister of the democratically elected Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia, where, in accordance with the\nmandate given to the Organization by the Paris Agreements\nof 23 October 1991, the United Nations has played a\nhistoric, decisive and successful role in ending 23 years of\nsuffering and misery for our people.\nMay I express a warm welcome and congratulations to\nMr. Samuel Insanally of the Republic of Guyana on his\nelection as President of the United Nations General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am sure that\nAmbassador Insanally will lead the deliberations of this body\nto a successful conclusion.\nI also wish to convey our warmest thanks and\nappreciation for the tireless work undertaken by his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of Bulgaria,\nfor his judicious and capable management of the General\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session.\nCambodia welcomes Andorra, the Czech Republic,\nEritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and the Republic of\nMacedonia to this international body. Their decision to\nbecome Members of the United Nations will no doubt help\nto strengthen peace and security in the world.\nOn behalf of His Majesty, Norodom Sihanouk, King of\nCambodia, of His Excellency, Mr. Hun Sen, Second Prime\nMinister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, and on\nbehalf of our people, may I be permitted to express our\nprofound and everlasting gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de\nCuellar, former Secretary-General of the United Nations; to\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, current Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations; and to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations in Cambodia, who are the artisans of the success of\nthe United Nations operation in Cambodia, which has\nbrought to our people peace, freedom, independence and the\nbeginning of a period in which democracy will be\nestablished in our motherland.\nAvailing myself of this solemn opportunity, I should\nlike to recall the important historic role played by Indonesia,\nFrance, Thailand, Japan and the People\u2019s Republic of China,\nwhich hosted crucial meetings on Cambodia that have led to\nthe present positive results. I should like to express my\ndeepest gratitude to the following eminent personalities, their\nExcellencies President Suharto and President Fran\u00e7ois\nMitterrand, Mr. Roland Dumas, Mr. Ali Alatas, Mr. Gareth\nEvans and Mr. Ahmed Rafeeuddin for their tireless\ncontributions to the success of this precious peace process.\nWe are most gratified by the many congratulatory\nmessages from Governments welcoming the promulgation of\nthe new Constitution of Cambodia and the reaccession to the\nthrone of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. Last, but\nnot least, the official recognition extended to the new,\ndemocratically elected Royal Government of Cambodia\nconstitutes an act of justice, which to us is of great\nencouragement.\nThe success of the United Nations operation in\nCambodia can be described as a combination of trust in the\ngood will of the international community to save Cambodia\nand of the will of the whole Cambodian population to save\nits homeland.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 7\nThe Cambodian people, by their participation, in huge\nnumbers, in the free and fair elections held in our country\nlast May, played a decisive role in sowing the seeds of\ndemocracy in Cambodia. His Majesty King Norodom\nSihanouk, father of the Cambodian nation, played a crucial\nrole in encouraging and nurturing national reconciliation\namong all Khmers, and provided firm support for the United\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and\nfor Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the leader of UNTAC. The steps\ntaken by His Majesty ensured success for the last stage of\nthe peace plan, including the drafting of our new\nConstitution and the orderly transfer of power.\nI am indeed pleased to report that the peace process in\nCambodia continues in accordance with the Paris Peace\nAgreements. The elections, in which, happily, huge numbers\nof my compatriots participated, were free and fair. Despite\ntremendous difficulties and constraints, the outcome was\nmost encouraging for the future of democracy in Cambodia.\nCambodia\u2019s new Constitution, which was drafted by a\nsovereign Constituent Assembly, established a constitutional\nmonarchy within the framework of a democratic and liberal\npolitical system, under which the people are the sole source\nof State power, and the judiciary is totally independent of\nthe legislature and the executive. The constitutional\nmonarchy represents the will of the people, expressed\nthrough their elected representatives in the constituent\nAssembly. Under the new Constitution, respect for human\nrights and individual freedoms has a key place.\nEven though we have the same leadership as we had\nduring the transitional period, when the provisional\nGovernment was in power, the establishment of the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia will ensure the social stability and\npeace that are so necessary to enable us all to dedicate\nourselves to the reconstruction and development of our\nhomeland.\nWe still need a peaceful settlement of the Khmer Rouge\nproblem. This problem must be resolved by the Cambodian\npeople. We hope that a solution will be arrived at during\nthe course of the November round-table discussions, at\nwhich His Majesty the King will preside. In this regard, the\nposition of the Royal Government of Cambodia is perfectly\nclear: we are ready to welcome the Khmer Rouge group as\nadvisers to the Royal Army and the Royal Government.\nHowever, we demand that, in return, the Khmer Rouge\ngroup assume the same responsibilities as were undertaken\nby the other three former parties that signed the Paris\nAgreements: that its administration be dismantled; that its\narmies and its zones become part of a single national entity,\na unified and indivisible Cambodia whose territory and land\nand maritime borders are internationally recognized, as was\nthe case in the 1960s; and that there be a central\ngovernmental structure consisting of a national Assembly, a\nRoyal Government, Royal armed forces and a Royal\nAdministration.\nThe international community should guarantee the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nCambodia. Indeed, a unique international guarantee is\nclearly enshrined in the text of the Agreement on a\nComprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia\nConflict of 23 October 1991, Part III, which is entitled\n\\\"Agreement concerning the sovereignty, independence,\nterritorial integrity and inviolability, neutrality and national\nunity of Cambodia\\\".\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia solemnly pledges\nthat it will scrupulously respect the relevant clauses of\narticles 1 and 3 of Part III of the Agreement. Cambodia\nrequests that, in return, all signatories to the Paris\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 respect the clauses\ncontained in articles 2, 4 and 5 of Part III.\nThe new Cambodia counts on all countries signatories\nto the Paris Agreements to\n\\\"solemnly undertake to recognize and respect the\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\ninviolability, neutrality and national unity of\nCambodia.\\\"\nNotably, the parties must\n\\\"refrain from interference, in any form whatsoever,\nwhether direct or indirect, in the internal affairs of\nCambodia.\\\"\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia urges that those\ncountries which have not yet subscribed to the Paris\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 do so in order to help\nCambodia and the Cambodian people, who have suffered so\nmuch, to maintain and reinforce this fragile peace. This is\nsomething that benefits not only Cambodia but the entire\nAsia-Pacific region. Maintenance of peace will be the sole\nguarantee of recovery and reconstruction in Cambodia.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n(spoke in French)\nWe are determined to conclude this process, and we\nshall do so by ourselves. However, after 23 years of war\nand suffering, Cambodia is a devastated country. Thus, the\nnew Cambodia needs aid and assistance from the\ninternational community. We pledge that we shall devote all\nour meagre human and financial resources and the extremely\ngenerous assistance of the international community to the\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of our devastated and\nimpoverished country.\nWe welcome the great success of the Tokyo Ministerial\nConference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of\nCambodia that took place in June 1992 and the success of\nthe international conference on the reconstruction of\nCambodia that was held in Paris last month. The success of\nboth these conferences is an indication of the international\ncommunity\u2019s great compassion for the Cambodian people,\nand we shall be for ever grateful.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia is determined,\nwith the help of the international community, to take all\nappropriate measures to meet this tremendous challenge. We\nare determined to respect and abide fully by the\narrangements provided for in Part IV of the Paris\nAgreements of 23 October 1991 on the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of Cambodia.\nIt is precisely because we are determined to achieve\nthese objectives that His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk,\nwith the agreement of the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Special Representative for Cambodia, asks,\nthrough the Secretary-General and the Security Council:\nFirst, a United Nations integrated office should be\nestablished in Cambodia.\nSecondly, the offices of the specialized agencies, such\nas the United Nations Development Programme, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund and the World Food Programme,\nshould be retained in Phnom Penh.\nThirdly, we should maintain the human rights\ncomponent in Phnom Penh and expand it into a permanent\nhuman rights centre.\nFourthly, we should continue the demining operations\nwithin the framework of the Cambodian Mine Action Center.\nFifthly, we should actively maintain in Phnom Penh a\nteam of military observers, who would help us to build\nconfidence among the Cambodian people and would also\nserve as a guarantee against external threats.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to draw\nthe attention of the international community to the problem\nof the mines which have been laid throughout Cambodia.\nCurrent research shows that there are between 6 million and\n10 million mines in Cambodian soil. The Royal\nGovernment requests the ongoing cooperation of the\ninternational community in removing as many of these mines\nas possible. In particular, we request assistance from the\ncentral database of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre,\nwhich is one of the most crucial aspects of the whole\noperation. The Cambodian Mine Action Centre has so far\ncleared over 3,883,230 square metres of minefield. The\nremaining task requires special equipment and a budget\nspanning the next 5 to 10 years. We hope that the\ninternational community can help us make our country safe\nfor present and future generations.\nAlso, as a signatory to the 1970 Convention on the\nMeans of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import,\nExport and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, and\nas the Angkor monuments have been listed since December\n1992 as a world heritage site, we request the international\ncommunity to give unstinting assistance to the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia in its struggle against the illicit\ntraffic of Khmer cultural patrimony, which has been subject\nto unprecedented looting and vandalism. In order to recover\nthese valuable cultural properties, we appeal to all countries\nwhich export such goods and through which they are\ntransported - whether or not they have ratified the foregoing\nConvention - to adopt the following steps to help us. First,\nthey should prevent national museums and similar\ninstitutions from acquiring any antiquities which are native\nto the Kingdom of Cambodia. Secondly, they should ban\nthe import of these cultural properties as soon as they are\nlegally listed in the inventories of Khmer national patrimony,\nif they are not legally licensed by the competent Cambodian\nauthorities for export purposes. Thirdly, they should take all\nnecessary steps to ensure that antique dealers and merchants\nof cultural resources assist the Royal Government of\nCambodia in recovering and repatriating those cultural\ntreasures illegally exported from the Kingdom of Cambodia.\nThe Royal Government of Cambodia wishes to express\nits deepest appreciation to the countries of the Association\nof South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for their past and\nongoing efforts to help Cambodia and the Cambodian people\nachieve peace, freedom and independence. We in Cambodia\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 9\nnote with sincere admiration the tremendous development\ntaking place in the countries of ASEAN, and we hope to\nlearn much from their extensive experience.\nCambodia very much regrets that conflict has engulfed\nthe former Yugoslavia, a country that always maintained\nclose and friendly relations with us. We sincerely hope that\nthe current negotiations will put an end to the suffering of\nthe innocent people of the various regions of that unfortunate\ncountry.\nCambodia also regrets the renewal of conflicts in\nSomalia, Angola and Georgia. We hope that the intervention\nof the international community will put a swift end to these\nconflicts that have caused so much bloodshed.\nCambodia congratulates the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization and the State of Israel for reaching initial\nagreement on some of the issues that have divided them for\nso many years and caused so much suffering to the\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples. We urge them to pursue\ntheir efforts to achieve permanent peace. My Government\nis thus pleased to announce that Cambodia has officially\nrestored diplomatic relations with the State of Israel at the\nambassadorial level.\nCambodia welcomes the progress achieved in the\ndiscussions between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States of America. We support the\n10-point programme proposed by President Kim Il Sung for\nthe peaceful reunification of Korea, and we also support the\ntotal nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.\nWe have followed with satisfaction the positive\ndevelopments in South Africa, where apartheid is being\ndismantled. We are aware that many obstacles remain and\nwe hope that they can be removed without senseless violence\nand in peaceful and constructive cooperation between the\nblack majority and the white minority.\n(spoke in English)\nBefore I conclude, may I be permitted to pay profound\nhomage to the courageous military and civilian personnel of\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, who\nhave given their lives for the cause of peace in my country.\nTheir names are enshrined deep in our hearts.\nCambodia\u2019s complex problems have been solved\npeacefully thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nThe Royal Government and people of Cambodia salute him\nand highly commend and praise him for his just leadership\nin the crucial Cambodia conflict and for bringing it to a\npeaceful settlement.\nThe message the people of Cambodia have entrusted\nme to convey to the General Assembly is one of gratitude,\nof hope and of continuous cooperation with the international\ncommunity with a view to strengthening peace, democracy\nand respect for human rights in Cambodia. We know that\nour task is huge, complex and by no means easy, but we\npledge to do our utmost to bring it to a successful\ncompletion.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. His election to this important post is, beyond a\ndoubt, a testimony to his personal credentials and the\nimportant role being played by his country in international\naffairs.\nI should also like to commend the work of his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who\ndemonstrated outstanding skills of diplomacy, and\ndedication.\nIt is also my pleasant duty to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\nuntiring efforts in promoting international peace and security.\nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the six\nnew States, Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco,\nthe Slovak Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia that have joined us during the past year. I am\nconfident that their participation and contribution will further\nenrich the work of the Organization.\nAlong with the end of the cold war came promises:\npromises of a better future, without the threat of nuclear\nholocaust, where scarce resources would not be spent on\nbuilding up military might, where millions of starving would\nbe fed and provided with their basic health care needs, safe\ndrinking water and a basic level of education, where a safe\nand clean environment would be provided along with the\nright to sustainable development, and where the dignity of\nthe human being would be respected. This is the vision that\ngave rise to this Organization in 1945.\nWe have rededicated ourselves to this vision with\nrenewed vigour following the demise of the cold war. The\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nmoral authority of the United Nations has been reasserted\nover military might. A number of protracted conflicts have\nshown signs of movement towards resolution. International\ncooperation in addressing global issues such as environment,\ndisarmament, international peace and security and human\nrights have reached new heights. As a consequence, the\nUnited Nations has gained new respect and been entrusted\nwith new responsibilities. In order to live up to the\nheightened expectations, the Organization must continue to\nreceive the unwavering commitment of its Member States.\nThe Republic of Maldives would like to take this\nopportunity to renew its commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThese changes in the work of the United Nations reflect\ncorresponding changes in the political, economic, and\nsecurity landscape that underpins efforts in international\ncooperation today. In view of this reality, the Security\nCouncil of the United Nations needs to be reformed and\nrestructured. We should be careful not to take a piecemeal\napproach to this: any expansion of the Council, and the\nstatus of the members, should be based on the principles of\nequitable and balanced representation. We should formulate\nprincipled criteria that reflect the political, economic and\ndemographic realities of the world today.\nThe events in Bosnia and Herzegovina have shamed us\nall. A State Member of the United Nations has been\nsubjected to naked aggression. The entire population of a\nsmall country is being progressively exterminated. It is\ndeliberate genocide.\nWe need to examine why the international community\nhas failed to stop the carnage that is taking place in that\ncountry. Regional, international and direct diplomacy have\nbeen applied, but to no avail. At a time when the world\ncommunity has rededicated itself to the sanctity of human\nrights, it is a tragic shame that systematic violation of these\nrights has gone unpunished owing to lack of will on the part\nof the international community.\nWe condemn the continued violence and genocide in\nBosnia and Herzegovina and call upon the international\ncommunity to take more decisive steps so that the\nresponsibilities entrusted to us under the Charter of this\nOrganization may be discharged fully. We fully recognize\nthe inherent right to self-defence, as prescribed in the\nCharter. We believe that the right to self-defence comprises\nthe most fundamental right - the right to life.\nA permanent solution to the situation in Bosnia should\nbe found by peaceful means and within the parameters of the\nCharter of the United Nations, one of which is the principle\nof territorial integrity.\nThe continued violations of basic human rights that are\ntaking place in Angola and Somalia are a matter of serious\nconcern to us. The events in Somalia - especially the attacks\non the United Nations peace-keeping personnel - are grave\ndevelopments that threaten the working of this Organization.\nUnited Nations involvement in Somalia now raises several\nquestions, including those concerning the sincerity of the\nwarring parties with regard to their acceptance of help from\nthe international community to overcome the extreme\npoverty that has ravaged the entire country.\nToday, the United Nations is learning a lesson that is\nvery expensive, in terms of both human life and financial\nresources, as it provides humanitarian assistance and seeks\nto protect the people of these countries. It is indeed ironic\nand tragic that peace- keepers have themselves become\ntargets of violence. My Government condemns such\nviolence in the strongest possible terms and believes that\nthose responsible for such acts should be brought to justice.\nThese experiences demonstrate that if the parties\ninvolved are not sincere in the efforts to find a peaceful\nsolution and to avoid violence, the United Nations, acting on\nits own, will be unable to perform miracles.\nDevelopments taking place in South Africa have been\nencouraging. The very active and high-level role currently\nbeing played by the United Nations in facilitating the\ncessation of political violence and the promotion of\nnegotiations to establish a democratic and non-racial State in\nSouth Africa is commendable. My Government also\ncommends the African National Congress (ANC) and the\nGovernment of South Africa for their positive attitude\ntowards working out the details of the multi-party elections.\nIn this connection, the recent agreement to set up a\nmulti-party Transitional Executive Council is a welcome\ndevelopment. We feel that the end of the era of apartheid,\nwhich is an affront to human dignity, is imminent. In this\ncontext, we urge all parties concerned to refrain from\nviolence and actions that would subvert the peace process.\nIt is our hope that when we meet here in New York\nnext year we shall have amongst us the true representatives\nof the South African people and that this Organization will\nbe able to benefit from their experience and knowledge.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 31\nThe Arab-Israeli peace talks that began in 1991 have\nmade remarkable progress. The signing of the declarations\nof principles by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\nand Israel in Washington last month was an historic event.\nIn this context, I should like to express to the PLO and the\npeople of Palestine our admiration for their courage and their\ndetermination to find a comprehensive and peaceful solution\nto the question of Palestine.\nThe Maldives pays tribute also to the Government of\nthe United States of America and other Governments\ninvolved for the important role they are playing in the\nMiddle East peace talks. It is our earnest hope that this\nagreement will lead to the restoration of the inalienable right\nof the Palestine people to self-determination, sovereign\nindependence and the establishment of a national homeland\non their own soil.\nThe tragic consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait\nare still a matter of serious concern to the international\ncommunity. All outstanding issues, such as the border\ndispute and the release of Kuwaiti and third-country\nprisoners still being held in Iraqi jails, should be settled\nimmediately. The resolution of these issues, in conformity\nwith international law and practice, will contribute to the\nelimination of tension and to the restoration of security and\nstability in the region.\nIn this regard, the Government of Maldives welcomes\nthe completion of the work of the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary\nDemarcation Commission and the endorsement of the report\nof this Commission by the Security Council. We also feel\nthat Kuwait\u2019s acceptance of the Commission\u2019s report is a\nvery positive step indicative of that country\u2019s eagerness and\nsincerity in its attitude towards a comprehensive solution.\nThe Government of Maldives urges Iraq to adopt an equally\npositive attitude in the interests of peace, security and\nstability.\nIn June this year the international community came\ntogether at the second World Conference on Human Rights\nto review and assess progress and setbacks in the area of\nhuman rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration\nin 1948. I am happy that we were able to make\nconsiderable progress in several key areas. We believe that\nsome of the achievements of this Conference will give new\nimpetus to the promotion of human rights throughout the\nworld. However, we all need to be very realistic in\naddressing this very important issue. The international\ncommunity should not let the promotion of human rights be\nused by a few as an excuse for imposing uniformity in\nhuman behaviour and thinking, at the expense of diversity.\nRather, it should emphasize the significance of the\nuniversality of human rights. We know only too well the\nfate of societies that try to impose uniform thinking and\nbehaviour on their peoples. Differences between individuals\nand societies should be valued. Such diversity enriches our\nfamily of nations.\nThe Government of Maldives has always attached great\nimportance to disarmament and international peace and\nsecurity. It is our firm belief that the production and\nstockpiling of armaments will only worsen the security of\nthe entire world. In this regard, Maldives calls upon the\ninternational community not to lose the current momentum\ntowards disarmament. We therefore urge the parties\ninvolved to continue to build upon past achievements,\nparticularly in the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the control of proliferation, the achievement of\ngreater transparency in armaments and the negotiation of\nother confidence-building measures.\nEarly this year, Maldives acceded to the Convention on\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production and\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\nWeapons and on Their Destruction, and, today, on behalf of\nthe Government of Maldives, I have signed the Convention.\nMaldives is not involved in the production and stockpiling\nof such weapons. My Government\u2019s accession and signature\ntherefore demonstrate our commitment to supporting all\ninternational efforts to eradicate such weaponry.\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was one of the\nfirst international Treaties to which my country became a\nparty after gaining its independence in 1965. Our\ncommitment to this Treaty is unwavering because we fully\nrealize the consequences of the proliferation of such\nweapons of mass destruction. My Government supports the\nindefinite extension of the Treaty beyond 1995. We believe\nthat, within its framework, progress could be made in the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of\npeace, for which my Government reiterates its full support.\nWe feel that the establishment of such zones will further\ncontribute to the promotion of international peace and\nsecurity.\nI also wish to express my Government\u2019s unqualified\nsupport for the total eradication of all weapons of mass\ndestruction, be it chemical, biological or nuclear, and to\nreiterate our call for the conclusion of effective agreements\non a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In this\nconnection, the Government of Maldives commends the\nUnited States for its unilateral decision to extend its\nmoratorium on nuclear testing until the end of 1994.\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe Charter of the United Nations recognizes the\ninherent rights of all States to self-defence. However, only\na privileged few possess the ability to provide for their own\nsecurity unilaterally. Small States which lack adequate\nfinancial resources for the acquisition of military equipment\nand face severe constraints in manpower are never in a\nposition to provide suitably for their own security. Any\nattempt by small States to build their military capabilities up\nto a level of even near self-reliance would be a mere waste\nof resources. The United Nations remains the only guarantor\nof security for the small States.\nIn the economic sphere, the world economy once again\nfailed to meet the expected rate of growth. It continues to\nbe characterized by deteriorating terms of trade for the\ndeveloping countries and rising protectionism in developed\ncountries. For decades the developing countries have sought\na new world economic order that would eliminate the\nimbalances existing in the present system. However, little\nhas been accomplished towards the attainment of this goal.\nThe scientific and technological gap between the developing\nand the developed countries is becoming ever wider. The\nflow of official development assistance has declined as a\nresult of the slow growth in the economies of the donor\ncountries.\nThe global arrangements and institutions established to\nmanage economic relations between States have not been\nable to lift the world from its present depression. This\nfailure has serious implications for the developing countries.\nIn order to avoid disastrous consequences, we call for an\nearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) that will set the tone for a future based on an open-\ntrading system.\nThe North-South dialogue must be reactivated on a new\nbasis comprising common interests and benefits and shared\nresponsibilities. Similarly, South-South cooperation must be\nintensified, allowing States to pool their resources and\npursue concrete development efforts within the framework\nof collective self-reliance and continued support for open\ntrading systems. The world cannot rise out of its economic\ndisarray and be assured of stability until the North and the\nSouth can together work out a system that encourages closer\neconomic relations and strengthens the North-South\nexchange.\nOne particular concept that needs emphasis is the\ninseparability of development from the equitable sharing of\nits fruits and its responsibilities. This twofold aspect of\ndevelopment must be pursued at one and the same time and\nwith equal intensity if development is to succeed. In this\nregard, let me reiterate my Government\u2019s firm belief that\nsustainable development is the only way to guarantee\ncontinued life on this planet Earth. We need to accelerate\nour efforts to meet the commitments we made in Rio last\nyear. We call on all States urgently to ratify the climate\nConvention and the bio-diversity Convention. My\nGovernment is proud to announce that it was one of the first\nto ratify both these Conventions.\nThe establishment of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment is a welcome development. We commend the\nCommission for the very productive work accomplished at\nits first substantive session and hope that its future work will\nbe of the same high standard.\nThe preparatory work for the Global Conference for\nSmall Island States on Sustainable Development and its\nImplications began during this year. My country, as a small\nisland State, regards this Conference as a very important step\nin addressing and finding practical solutions to the unique\nproblems facing us in our developmental efforts. We hope\nthat the international community will continue to participate\nconstructively in the preparatory process and will participate\nin the Conference itself.\nThe responsibility that has been thrust upon us today is\ntremendous. The realization of the dreams of our peoples\nare in our hands. We cannot afford to be blind to the\ndesires of our peoples to be better fed, to have safer drinking\nwater, to have access to education and health-care needs and\nto be free from the prospect of nuclear holocaust and the\ndangers of environmental degradation. We cannot afford to\nbe embroiled in the build-up of stockpiles of armaments and\nweapons of mass destruction while our economies are the\nmain victims of these acquisitions for death and destruction.\nWe should rise above all this and become more human\nin all our endeavours. I have no doubt that together we can\nactually achieve the better future that has been promised to\nus.\n"

It is the right way to\nhonour their memories and to answer the needs of the newly\nborn. We have to lay the foundations for a new Middle\nEast.\nThe peace agreement between us and the Palestinians\nis not just an accord signed by political leaders. It is an\nongoing, profound commitment to the next generation of\nArabs and Israelis, Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of\nall other faiths.\nWe know it is not enough to declare an end to war.\nWe have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. If we\nonly bring violence down but ignore misery, we may\ndiscover that we have traded one menace for another peril.\nTerritorial disputes may have been the reason for wars\nbetween nations, and poverty may again become the seed of\nviolence between peoples. While signing the documents on\nthe lawn of the White House, I could almost sense the\nbreeze of a fresh spring, and my imagination began to\nwander to the skies of our land, which may have become\nbrighter to the eyes of all people, both those who agree and\nthose who oppose. On the lawn one could almost hear the\nheavy tread of boots leaving the stage after a hundred years\nof hostility. One could have heard the gentle tiptoeing of\nnew steps making a debut in a world awaiting peace.\nYet we could not depart from reality. I know that the\nsolution to the Palestinian issue may be the key to a new\nbeginning, but it is in no way the answer to the many needs\nawaiting us upon our return home.\nThe last decade saw great changes, including the end of\nEast-West confrontation and the opening of the way for the\ngradual disappearance of North-South polarization. The\ngreat continent of Asia and the picturesque continent of\nSouth America introduced the dynamics of an economic\ndevelopment of their own. The dramatic event in South\nAfrica is a declaration to the same effect. So, contrary to all\nassumptions, it has been demonstrated that neither geography\nnor race is a hindrance or an advantage to economic\npromise.\nWe witnessed the end of some wars only to discover\nthat the warriors did not reach their own promised land.\nSome colonized people gained their independence, but they\nhardly enjoyed its fruits. The dangers may have been over,\nbut their hopes evaporated. We have learned that the end of\na war should be the beginning of a new genesis, which will\nbe the end of belligerency and will put an end to\npsychological prejudices.\nNo nation, rich or poor, is able nowadays to attain\nsecurity unless the region in which it exists is secure. The\nscope of regional security must exceed the range of ballistic\nmissiles, which may hit each and all of us.\nAs we strive to achieve a comprehensive peace, no\nwound must remain unhealed.\nGeographically speaking, we live side by side with the\nJordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious geographically\nmust become clear politically. We have already agreed with\nthe Hashemite Kingdom on many complicated issues, and\nthere is no doubt that we can complete the story fully, that\nwe can offer the people on both sides of the river full peace,\nthat the Dead Sea can become a spring of new life and that\nthe old waters of the River Jordan can be a source of\nprosperity flowing from each side to the other.\nWe hope - as a matter of fact, we are determined - to\nmake peace with Syria, yet we ask the Syrian leadership, if\nit has chosen peace, why it refuses to meet openly. If Syria\nis aiming for the Egyptian fruits of peace, it must follow the\nprocess that led to them. Both of us have to look ahead and\nrealize that the threats of war are no more than an illusion\nthat one can return to an unbearable past.\nWe shall not give up our negotiations with our\nLebanese neighbours. We do not have any territorial claims\nor any political pretensions concerning Lebanon. We pray,\ntogether with many Lebanese, that their country will no\nlonger be a back yard for troublemakers. It is for Lebanon\nto make a choice between Hizbollah, on the one hand, which\noperates from its territory and then takes orders from another\nGovernment, and, on the other, insisting on having one\narmy, one policy, and offering real tranquillity to its people\nand security to its neighbours. Lebanon does not need a\nlicense to regain its independence, and Lebanon should not\npostpone its return to its balanced, traditional policy.\nI am not sure whether there is a new order in the\nworld, but all of us feel there is a new world awaiting an\norder. We are encouraged by the new attempt of the United\nNations and its Secretary-General to answer the social and\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\neconomic call of the present era. The United Nations was\ncreated as a political answer; today it must face social and\neconomic questions.\nThe Middle East, which has been an important agenda\nitem in United Nations history, must become prosperous, not\nonly peaceful. To construct a modern Middle East we need\nwisdom no less than financial support.\nWe have to rid ourselves of the costly follies of the\npast and adopt the principles of modern economy. Who\nwill, and who should, pay the cost of oversized armies?\nWho will, and who should, bear the price of an arms race\nwhose cost has reached $50 billion annually? Who will, and\nwho should, pay for the inefficiencies of old systems? Who\nwill, and who should, compensate for outmoded censorship\nof mail and control of trade and travel? And who will\ncomply with the State where suspicion intercepts the\nenterprising spirit of the people?\nWe can, and we should, turn to the promises of\nscientific development, the market economy and\ncomprehensive education. We must base our industry,\nagriculture and services on the highest of today\u2019s\ntechnologies. We have to invest in our schools. Israel, a\ncountry of immigration, is blessed with many scientists and\nengineers. We shall gladly make this human wealth\navailable as a contribution.\nI know that there is suspicion; that, when referring to\na common market in the Middle East or announcing an\nIsraeli contribution, it may be perceived as an attempt to win\npreference or to establish domination. May I say sincerely\nand loudly that we did not give up territorial control to\nengage ourselves in economic superiority. The age of\ndomination, political or economic, is dead. The time of\ncooperation has begun.\nAs a Jew, may I say that the virtue and the essence of\nour history since the times of Abraham and the\ncommandments of Moses have been an uncompromising\nopposition to any form of occupation, domination and\ndiscrimination. For us, Israel is not just a territorial\nhomeland, but a permanent moral commitment as well.\nThere are other questions, concerning the building of a\ncommon market in the Middle East, as to how to attain this\nwhen governments are so varied and economies are so\ndifferent. The differences in governments and economies\nshould not prevent us from doing together what can be done\ntogether: combating the desert and offering fertility to an\narid land.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations declared that the Middle East must double its\nagricultural production in the 25 years to come. The\npopulation of the region in the same period will double itself\nanyway. The land is cut by many and large deserts and its\nwater resources are stingy and scarce. Yet we know that in\na similar period of time - the 25 years between 1950 and 1975 -\nIsrael was able to increase its agricultural output twelvefold -\nan increase unprecedented in history.\nDuring the past decade, 95 per cent of the growth of\nour agriculture resulted from research, planning, training and\norganizing. High technology permits nations to attain real\nindependence and to experience genuine freedom, political\nas well as economic. There is nothing new about the\nscarcity of water in our midst. Jacob and Esau drank from\nthe same wells even when their paths were separated. But\nthen, unlike today, they could not desalinate the sea water;\nthey could not computerize irrigation; nor could they enjoy\nthe potential of biotechnology.\nWe are meeting again with an entirely different\nopportunity. Greening the land can be accompanied by the\ncreation of many new jobs for all people in the area. The\nmost promising opportunity may be the development of\ntourism. No other branch of modern industry assures an\nimmediate growth of the Middle East like this one. Our area\nis blessed by nature and by history, a history which is still\nvery much alive: the eternity of Jerusalem, the magnificence\nof the pyramids, the symbols of Luxor, the Hanging Gardens\nof Babylon, the Pillars of Wisdom in Baalbek, the red\npalaces of Petra, the inimitable charm of Marakesh, the old\nwinds which still blow in Carthage, not forgetting the\nbeaches of Gaza or the scent of Jericho\u2019s perfumed fruits.\nWe have to open roads to those wonders and keep them safe\nand hospitable. Tourism depends on tranquility; tourism\nenhances tranquillity. It makes friendship a vested interest.\nThirdly, we have to build an infrastructure with modern\nmeans so as to avoid the pitfalls of the past. Modern\ntransportation and revolutionary communications crossing the\nair, covering the ground and connecting the seas will turn\ngeographical proximities into an economic advantage. We\nshould not ask taxpayers of other countries to finance follies\nof our own. We have to correct them ourselves. We do not\nhave the moral right to ask for the financing of unnecessary\nwars or wasteful systems.\nIf the thumping of hammers replaces the thunder of\nguns, many nations will be more than willing to extend a\nhelping hand. They will invest in a better future. They will\nsupport the replacement of unwarranted confrontation with\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23\nmuch-needed economic competition. Markets can serve the\nneeds of the people no less than flags can signify their\ndestinies. The time has come to build a Middle East for the\npeople and not just for the rulers.\nIt was not simple to open the locked doors to peace. In\nthe name of God, let them not be closed again. Let peace\nbe comprehensive, embracing all issues, all countries, all\ngenerations. We suggest that we all negotiate together as\nequals. We offer a common ground of mutual respect and\nmutual compromise. Thirteen years have passed since we\nmade peace with Egypt. We are grateful to Egypt and its\nPresident for expanding understanding, overt and hidden. In\na world in which so many insoluble problems reside, the\nPalestinians and we have finally shown that in fact there are\nno insoluble problems, only people who tend to believe that\nmany problems are insoluble.\nWe have negotiated one of the most complicated issues\nof the last 100 years. We are grateful to the United States\nfor its support and leadership. We are grateful to both\nPresident Clinton and Secretary Christopher for their crucial\nrole. We appreciate the Egyptian role and the Norwegian\nencouragement; the European involvement and serious\ncontribution; the Asian support and blessing. Maybe we\nnow have the right to say to other people in conflict: \\\"Do\nnot give up. Do not surrender to old obsessions and do not\ntake fresh disappointments at face value.\\\" What we did,\nothers can do as well.\nWe are determined to make the agreement with the\nPalestinians into a permanent success. Israel would consider\nthe economic success of the Palestinians as though it were\nits own, and I believe that a newly achieved security will\nserve the aspirations of the Israelis and the necessities of the\nPalestinians.\nGaza, after 7,000 years of suffering, can emancipate\nitself from want. Jericho, without its fallen walls, can see its\ngardens blossom again.\nAs the twentieth century comes to a close, we have\nlearned from the United States and Russia that there are no\nmilitary answers to the new military dangers, only political\nsolutions. Successful economies are no longer a monopoly\nof the rich and the mighty. They represent an open\ninvitation to every nation ready to adopt the combination of\nscience and open-mindedness. We see at the end of this\ncentury that politics can achieve more by good will than by\npower, and that the young generation watching their\ntelevisions compare their lot with the fortunes or misfortunes\nof others. They see freedom, they watch peace, they view\nprosperity, all in real time. They know that they can attain\nmore if they work harder.\nIf we want to represent their hopes, we have to\ncombine wise policies and regional security with market\neconomies. Historically we were born equal, and equally we\ncan give birth to a new age.\n\\\"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the\nplowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ngrapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall\ndrop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.\\\" (The\nHoly Bible, Amos 9:13)\nSo said the Prophet.\n"

        "file_text": " I am\nextremely pleased to bring warm and cordial greetings from\nthe Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis. It is\nindeed with a profound sense of pleasure and honour that I\naddress this, the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations.\nFirst, I should like to express my sincere\ncongratulations and appreciation to the outgoing President,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the very proficient and skilful manner\nin which he handled last year\u2019s deliberations.\nI hasten to extend to you, Sir, our new President, a very\nhearty welcome. Your presence in the Chair is a source of\ngreat joy and pride to all of us from the Caribbean. I know\nthat you will bring your vast experience and great skill to\nbear on these proceedings. I wish to assure you of my\ncountry\u2019s continued support and willing cooperation.\nI should also like to commend most highly our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose\ncommitment to the furtherance of the cause of peace,\nequality, freedom and democracy world wide stands out as\na testament to hope and prosperity in a time of conflict and\nsocial chaos.\nLast week the world was shocked by the tragedy of the\nearthquake which caused such extensive loss of life in India.\nI extend condolences to the Government and people of India\non behalf of the Government and people of Saint Kitts and\nNevis. I know that the world community will continue to\nrespond in appropriate measure with timely assistance.\nMy Government regrets the startling and violent events\nthat have been occurring in Russia over the past few days,\nand we express the hope that peace will quickly return and\nthat democracy will indeed come to the people of Russia.\nOn 19 September my country, Saint Kitts and Nevis,\ncelebrated the tenth anniversary of our independence. On 23\nSeptember it was 10 years since I had in this Hall\nannounced our nation to the world, indicating the principles\nthat would guide our participation in world affairs and the\nobjectives that we would pursue. The principles enunciated\nthen are timeless and unchanging, and I can only ask the\nAssembly to revisit them with me as I quote:\n\\\"The rights and freedoms embodied in the Constitution\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis reflect our commitment to the\nsanctity of human life, and of human dignity, the rights\nof the individual, and the non-violent pursuit of\nhappiness.\\\" (A/38/PV.3, p. 41)\nAt that time the East and the West stood precariously\nbalanced on the brink of the total nuclear annihilation of the\nhuman species. Today the world breathes a collective sigh\nof relief as the process of reducing nuclear armaments is\ngenuinely proceeding.\nInitially Saint Kitts and Nevis refused to sign the\nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Our position was a\nprincipled one, because while we supported the objective of\nstemming the spread of nuclear weapons among countries,\nwe felt that in practical terms it would be meaningless unless\nthose countries with the largest stockpiles of nuclear\nweapons made meaningful reductions in their arsenals.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 21\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has now signed the Treaty. I call on\nall countries with nuclear weapons or the capacity to make\nthem to join in the global effort for the complete elimination\nof nuclear weapons.\nOur attention is focused now on conventional conflicts\nin various arenas. The fighting and the attendant atrocities\nreported from the theatre of conflict in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina represent a serious affront to every principle of\nhuman sanctity and human dignity that we share within this\nbody of nations. The United Nations is endeavouring to\nfulfil a humanitarian mission, but we must redouble our\nefforts to bring an end to the fighting. We cannot but\nexpress our condemnation and abhorrence at the atrocity of\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" being attempted in that theatre of conflict.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis appeals to all the\nparties involved in this brutal conflict to heed the call of the\ninternational community to broker a peaceful settlement and\nto respect the efforts of the United Nations to implement\neffective programmes aimed at ending the civil war and at\nproviding humanitarian assistance to those victims caught in\nthe crossfire.\nMy Government commends the efforts of the United\nNations in delivering humanitarian assistance to the people\nof Somalia who face the threat of disease, hunger, starvation\nand imminent death. At the same time, my Government\ndeplores the barbarous attacks on United Nations personnel\ndeployed in Somalia by forces loyal to Somali factions. We\nwould also like to add our voice in protest against the killing\nof 23 Pakistani peace-keeping soldiers, and others\nsubsequently. Although we would wish to see the\nperpetrators punished, it is our hope that the United Nations\nwill remain faithful to its original mandate to keep the peace\nand feed the hungry.\nMy country looks forward to an early end and a\npermanent solution that will permit the process of\ndevelopment to be resumed. We sincerely hope that this\ncrisis does not threaten the prospects for peace in the Horn\nof Africa.\nElsewhere in Africa hope has come alive. I refer in\nparticular to the developments in South Africa. The\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the\nannouncement of the prospects of non-racial and multi-party\nelections scheduled to take place in South Africa in April\nl994. The Caribbean has always been unambiguous and\nemphatic in its condemnation of apartheid. There is no\ndoubt that our commitment and our principled stand has\ncontributed to the inevitable dismantling of the unjust system\nof apartheid.\nWe are at the threshold of a new South Africa which\noffers to its people an unprecedented opportunity to write a\nnew chapter in the history of South Africa whereby the\neradication of apartheid could lead to the creation of a new,\nunited, non-racial and democratic society. We are extremely\nencouraged by the progress in the negotiations taking place\nbetween the Government of F. W. de Klerk, Nelson Mandela\nof the African National Congress (ANC), and members of\nother political parties in South Africa. While there are still\nmajor difficulties, we call upon all parties to seize this\nopportunity to bring peace and freedom to all South\nAfricans.\nHowever, Member Governments must maintain their\nvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council has been\nestablished, with the proper terms of reference clearly\noutlined and defined, to allow for the integration and active\nparticipation of all races within the developmental and\ngovernmental process of that country. But Saint Kitts and\nNevis supports Nelson Mandela\u2019s call for the removal of\nsanctions at this time.\nThe involvement and influence of the United Nations in\nconflict resolution have been outstanding in recent times. In\nthis regard, my delegation wishes to applaud the timely\nefforts of the United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS) to bring the relevant parties in the\nHaitian crisis to the negotiating table. My Government\nwelcomes the Governors Island Agreement brokered by the\nUnited Nations, which resulted in talks between\nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the military high\ncommand in Haiti. The appointment and installation of\nPrime Minister Malval, who was chosen by President\nAristide, was a significant achievement.\nThe international community must provide support and\nsecurity to ensure the safe return of President Aristide,\nfollowing which a major development offensive, with\ninstitution-building, must be mounted and sustained. Haiti\nmust be given the same high priority as is accorded to other\nareas of conflict or poverty in the world.\nChanges in international affairs are taking place with a\nstartling rapidity and suddenness that could not possibly have\nbeen predicted. Who would have expected the surprising but\nvery welcome rapprochement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which now offers\na genuine prospect for peace in the Middle East? The peace\nprospect is obviously very fragile, but we must all support\nit and give it every opportunity to prosper. The realities of\nthe present world situation call not for a hardening of\ntraditional attitudes, but for a genuine search for solutions,\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\neven if they require unprecedented approaches and\ncompromises.\nAlso in relation to that region, we welcome the\nfinalization of the demarcation of the boundary between\nKuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished by the Iraq-\nKuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on 20 May\n1993. We also welcome the adoption by the Security\nCouncil of its resolution 833 (1993), in which it guaranteed\nthe inviolability of the boundary between the two States.\nWe expect that this guarantee will serve as a deterrent\nagainst future conflict between Kuwait and Iraq, and also\nenhance stability and security in the region. Iraq is called\nupon to respect the terms of Security Council resolution 833\n(1993) and other relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWho would have predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall\nand the reunification of East and West Germany? Who\nwould have predicted the breakup of the Soviet Union and\nthe subsequent United Nations membership of a large\nnumber of new sovereign States? The United Nations has\nbeen in the midst of it all. We have welcomed the\nmembership of North and South Korea, ideological\ndifferences notwithstanding. And we support their efforts\ntowards reunification.\nIt is clear that membership in the United Nations is\nneither a deterrent to reunification, as we saw in the case of\nGermany, nor to fragmentation, as we saw in the case of the\nSoviet Union. Whatever the aspirations of a country\u2019s\npeople, as determined by that people, these can be\naccommodated within the framework and forum of the\nUnited Nations, which is more effective as an organ\noperating by a process of inclusion than one operating by a\nprocess of exclusion.\nIn that context, my Government calls on the United\nNations to begin the process that would eventually lead to\nthe admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into this\nOrganization. The Republic of China on Taiwan has proved\nitself to be a country that espouses the principles inherent in\nthe United Nations Charter, a country dedicated to peace,\nsocial tranquillity and economic development, not only for\nits people, but also for the peoples of other nations.\nI want to extend a warm welcome to those who have\nbecome Members of this august body and to congratulate\nthem on seeking membership within this brotherhood of\nnations. Membership itself implies an acceptance of the\nUnited Nations Charter and a recognition of the importance\nof the Organization\u2019s objectives. I want to assure these new\nMember States of my Government\u2019s readiness to extend a\nwilling hand of friendship and cooperation as we work\ntogether to further the cause of global peace and human\ndevelopment.\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis fully\nsubscribes to the policy of universality of membership. It is\nour strong belief that once a country satisfies the\nprerequisites for membership it should be allowed to join\nand to participate actively in the international fraternity of\nnations dedicated to upholding the principles of the Charter.\nIt is timely, in the context of membership, to examine\nthe issue of the planned restructuring of the United Nations.\nI would like to underscore the fact that the Government of\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is fully supportive of the movement\ntowards restructuring the United Nations with a view to\nensuring that such restructuring will lead to the creation of\nmore efficient and effective organs that are responsive to the\ndevelopment needs of States Members of the Organization.\nThis restructuring should include both the permanent and the\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council.\nAs we seek to proceed with plans for the restructuring\nof the United Nations, the Government of Saint Kitts and\nNevis wishes emphasis to be placed on ensuring that\nequitable geographic representation is seen to be encouraged,\nespecially in respect of decision-making and in respect of\npositions within the Secretariat. For too long, countries like\nmine in the Caribbean have not been adequately represented\nwithin the United Nations Secretariat. I wish to suggest\nalso that due consideration be given to the establishment of\na United Nations office in the eastern Caribbean to serve the\ninterests of the smaller island-States that comprise the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).\nWe have looked at the questions of membership and\nrestructuring of the United Nations. It is important for us to\nreview the question of the mission of the Organization. The\nCharter calls for the promotion of the economic and social\nadvancement of all peoples. Ten years after our\nindependence, Saint Kitts and Nevis would like to remind\nthe Assembly of the mission as we perceived it then:\n\\\"We seek the establishment of a new international\neconomic order, for a redeployment of the world\u2019s\nresources and for the implementation of mechanisms to\nincrease the flow of assistance towards the world\u2019s\npoor.\\\" (A/38/PV.3, p. 42)\nWe ask ourselves: to what extent are these objectives\nbeing realized? To what extent is the mission being\nfulfilled? The answers are gravely disappointing. The new\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 23\ninternational economic order that seems to be emerging is\none in which the developed and the more powerful countries\nare creating mega-sized trading and economic blocs, and\nseeking to establish rules designed to secure their own\naggrandizement at the expense of small developing countries\nlike ours in the Caribbean, which are being quietly but\nsurely marginalized. We see the developed and powerful\ncountries seeking to redeploy the world\u2019s resources, as found\nin the biodiversity of our forests and the vastness of the\nocean resources, for their own benefit, on the spurious\nground that the technology is theirs and not ours. We see\nflows of direct assistance to developing countries drying up,\nand more so for the countries of the Caribbean. It would\nappear that the hope of seeing this mission fulfilled is less\nrealizable now than it was 10 years ago.\nSome will say that the danger of nuclear war is\ndiminished. Some will say that many conflicts are being\nresolved, even though new ones are springing up. And\npeace is being realized in many former areas of conflict.\nThat is all true. The question remains, however: What sort\nof peace are we experiencing? Peace in Haiti is fragile;\npeace in the Middle East is uneasy; peace in Africa is\nunstable. I submit that the prospects for lasting peace would\nbe immeasurably enhanced if we sought to achieve that\npeace through development.\nPeace and development have always been linked, but\nthey are always portrayed as following parallel courses. My\ncountry contends that their paths must be merged and that\nwe must achieve the one, peace, as a consequence of the\nother, development - development which must be sustainable\nand sustained.\nIt is important that all sectors of our communities have\nthe opportunity to participate in the process of development\nand to enjoy its benefits. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, we\nensure as a matter of policy that women are empowered to\nbe effective participants in development. Our Ministry of\nWomen\u2019s Affairs designs and implements programmes for\ntraining and mobilizing women in a variety of areas essential\nto the development of our country. This is an approach we\nrecommend to all developing countries as part of the process\nof maximizing our human resources.\nMy Government welcomes the call for a Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, scheduled to convene in Barbados in\nApril 1994. We hope that this will result in tangible benefits\nfor the small island developing economies of the Caribbean\nand in a recognition of our special characteristics and needs.\nThere is developing in international affairs - in relation to\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the\nEuropean Common Market and the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) - a \\\"one size fits all\\\" mentality, or a \\\"one\nprescription for all countries approach\\\". These are obviously\nout of place in matters of development and human needs.\nThe peculiarities and differences which prompted the\nadoption of special economic arrangements - the Caribbean\nBasin Initiative, the Trade and Investment Agreement\nbetween Canada and the Caribbean Community Countries\n(CARIBCAN) and the Lom\u00e9 Convention - are still very\npresent today, and are likely to remain so, because our\nislands are not going to become any larger. In fact, we\nsuffer from serious coastal erosion, which can be properly\naddressed only if substantial financial assistance is\nforthcoming.\nI appeal to the Member nations of this august body to\nrecognize also the fragility of our export commodities, such\nas sugar and bananas, as their producers represent the major\nemployers, and they are significant sources of foreign\nexchange, for many Caribbean countries. Any loss, no\nmatter how small, of the limited access which these products\nfrom the Caribbean enjoy could have catastrophic\nconsequences for the economies and lives of the people in\nthe Caribbean, and by extension could undermine the\nsocio-political tranquillity of the region.\nI cannot overemphasize the vulnerability of the\nCaribbean\u2019s ecosystem and the need for constant vigilance\nwith respect to its protection and preservation. It is against\nthis backdrop that my Government, along with other\nGovernments of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),\nstrongly condemns the transboundary movement of toxic\nwaste and of nuclear and other hazardous materials through\nthe Caribbean basin. We therefore call upon the\nindustrialized countries to refrain from exporting their waste\nto or through the Caribbean region. We also deplore the\ndumping of ship-generated waste in our Caribbean waters,\nand call upon all ships\u2019 operators to discontinue the practice.\nThose waters are indeed a significant part of our economic\npatrimony.\nThe Rio Summit was a watershed for unprecedented\npartnership and international cooperation in the area of\nenvironmental protection. The approach that we as nations\nadopt on the environment should be modelled in such a way\nas to demonstrate our commitment to human development,\nenvironmental protection and sustainable growth.\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nI want to make a strong appeal to the industrialized\ncountries and the multilateral agencies to be more rational\nand more sensitive to the developmental needs of the\ndeveloping world, especially island communities, in their\napproach to dealing with the environment. Environmental\nconcerns must be appropriately considered within the context\nof sustainable development. The peoples of the developing\ncountries are entitled to an improved standard of life. The\nindustrialized North, therefore, should not use a single policy\non environment as a yardstick for assessing an individual\ncountry\u2019s eligibility for developmental assistance.\nMy Government firmly believes that our environment\nmust be protected and preserved at all costs - not at the\nexpense of our people\u2019s standard of living, but rather to\nenhance their quality of life. The desirability of\nenvironmental protection must be appropriately balanced\nagainst the imperatives of human development.\nThe problem of environmental degradation concerns a\nglobal common which we all share, and it is only through\ninternational collaboration and an adequate transfer of\ntechnical and financial assistance from developed to\ndeveloping countries that we can begin to arrest and, hence,\neventually solve this problem.\nWhile we attempt to harness our collective efforts to\nimprove the standard of living of our citizens, we are faced\nwith the increasing danger of drug trafficking and\nnarco-terrorism. We can ill afford to relax our resolve.\nWhile we seek peace on other fronts we must continue to\nwage war relentlessly on the illicit drug trade and those who\nwork so assiduously to bolster it. There is an urgent need\nfor greater financial assistance and technical expertise to\ncombat this problem. It is the children, the flower of our\nyouth, the promise of our nations\u2019 tomorrows, who are being\ndestroyed today.\nAt the historic children\u2019s Summit in 1990, we set\nourselves the task of creating a better world for children and\nof equipping them now to manage it in the future. The\nchallenge is vast, involving their educational, health,\nphysical, mental and psychological development, and we\nmust make ourselves equal to the task.\nThere can be no greater or more noble mission than to\nensure that our youth from developing nations, small or\nlarge, as from developed nations, is given every opportunity\nto aspire to a better quality of life. We can better achieve\nthis in a world of peace, and we can better realize and\nmaintain that peace through development.\n"

        "file_text": "I come from a free, small and sovereign\nisland in Latin America. My ancestors were able to shed the\nyoke of a colonial empire and achieve an independence that,\nsince the moment of its birth, has been burdened by the\ninterventionist impositions of a foreign power. I belong to\na people that was able, for several generations, to forge an\nauthentic revolution, which also opened the path to hope for\nother peoples of the Third World.\nFor these reasons, and as a Caribbean people, we are\ndoubly proud of having you, Mr. President, presiding over\nthis session. Because you are a son of that South that makes\nus brothers, we are convinced that that world and its hopes\nwill not be ignored once again. In that just aspiration you\nwill certainly find Cuba\u2019s support.\nConditions in the world have radically changed in less\nthan five years. Bipolar balance is being replaced by\nunipolar hegemony. The world is increasingly plagued by\nstill insuperable contradictions between words and deeds.\nWhile it is said that the threat of a nuclear holocaust has\ndisappeared, the poverty and underdevelopment that cause\nmisery and death are continuing. Millions of men, women\nand children die every day, with no possibility of being\nsaved. It is said that the arms race between the superPowers has ended but, increasingly, there is a rush to\ndevelop new weapons systems and even to introduce them\nto outer space.\nToday, the warlords aspire to rule the skies without\nhaving resolved many of the problems on Earth.\nParadoxically, they argue that they lack the resources to do\nso, while the world today is becoming increasingly\nungovernable because of them. The total budget of the\nWorld Health Organization equals the expenditures caused\nby three hours of the arms race. How can hunger in\nSomalia be alleviated, for example, if for every dollar used\nto feed the hungry, $10 are spent on the maintenance of\nmilitary operations in that country?\nThe existence of treaties on a partial ban of nuclear\ntests and on a moratorium, or on the non-proliferation of\nsuch weapons, is not enough. A single agreement would\nsuffice, one providing for general and complete disarmament\nand for the use of the enormous resources that would thus\ncease to be squandered for the final resolution of our\nplanet\u2019s serious problems.\nRegrettably, the end of the cold war has not resolved\nany of the fundamental problems facing humankind; instead,\nit has created many others. The sacred principles of\nindependence and national sovereignty are being shredded to\npieces, and are guaranteed only to a few powerful countries\nwhose views prevail even in this lofty Organization. The\nUnited Nations was created, among other objectives, for the\nachievement of a lasting peace, justice and equality in\ninternational relations. Some things have been done, but\nmuch remains to be done for the benefit of human beings\nand of peoples.\nWhile the longstanding problems of the Third World\npersist and become more acute, aggravated by stagnation in\ndevelopment assistance, what peace can we speak of? While\nunequal exchange, external debt and the transfer of resources\nfrom developing to developed countries - to mention but a\nfew examples - still persist, will there truly be peace? While\nprotectionist and discriminatory practices in international\ntrade prevail, and the terms of trade of developing countries\ncontinue to deteriorate, will we honestly be able to achieve\njustice?\nOnly through effective cooperation, radically\nrestructuring present international economic relations, would\npoor nations be allowed to develop and to grow. The\ninitiatives adopted by the Organization by consensus are\ncountless yet we continue to be ignored by the most\npowerful countries.\nThe new international economic order, three\ninternational development strategies, four United Nations\ndevelopment decades, at least four special sessions of the\nGeneral Assembly, a number of conferences on population,\nenvironment, habitat, and even the Rio de Janeiro\nConference itself exemplify hopes placed by peoples the\nworld over in the United Nations, but without tangible\nresults. The selfishness and lack of political will faced by\nthe poor of this Earth, the children of colonialism, racism,\nplundering and foreign intervention, are truly disappointing.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nOn the other hand, neo-liberal doctrines are now\nrampant in the assistance programmes of the Organization,\nproclaiming only the virtues of the market and of private\nenterprise. Defending only these options means separating\npopulations of developing countries from the real production\nof wealth. This accentuates the inequalities, attacks true\ndemocracy, social development and the right of human\nbeings to achieve a productive and dignified life.\nWe the countries of the South are no more than\nstatistics to the North. Meticulous studies are carried out to\ndetermine that we will be born in greater numbers, that more\nof us will fall to disease and that more of us will die.\nThe quality of life of the generations that have been\nborn and have died while I speak would demand that those\nbulky files where tragedies are noted in detail, would also\nhave the power to feed and heal the needy. Simply knowing\nthat we are dying in the countries of the South on this planet\nwill not prevent us from being buried.\nThe surviving third world has once again placed its\nhopes in the preparation of an agenda for development and\nis awaiting with interest the Secretary-General\u2019s report on\nthe subject. A new frustration would be a luxury for which\nwe would never be forgiven by this suffering humanity.\nThe World Summit for Social Development to be held\nin 1995 will also provide us with a new opportunity to place\nhuman beings at the centre of the United Nations efforts, and\nto give this subject the priority it deserves in the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe world we live in is condemned to a gradual\ndestruction that can only be stopped by our collective\nwisdom. The right to life, the most basic of human rights,\nis constantly threatened by the progressive deterioration of\nthe ozone layer, by the pollution of the environment and its\nunderground and surface waters, by the exhaustion of arable\nland and by the constant increase in the legions of the\nundernourished and underemployed. This dehumanizing\ncruelty is the result of what is mistakenly called\ncontemporary industrial civilization. Together with these\nlacerating realities, humanity is facing other challenges\nwhich, though different, are no less complex.\nRecently, the World Conference on Human Rights\nconcluded by reaffirming the universality, interdependence\nand indivisibility of those rights. That Conference rightly\nreiterated that the issue must be dealt with in an objective,\nimpartial and non-selective manner.\nAttempts are made to say that the majority of violations\nof human rights originate in the impoverished countries of\nthe South, while an overwhelming majority of their accusers\ncome from the affluent countries of the North. It seems that\nthose who claim to be the resolute defenders of certain\nindividual freedoms, also include among those freedoms, and\nwith equal ease, the violence that increasing neo-fascist and\nracist currents are unleashing in their own societies.\nHas that North not been the source, and now more than\never, of discrimination against migrant workers, against the\nincreasingly dispossessed strata of society and against\nnational minorities?\nWho are the main beneficiaries of the trade in human\norgans? Where are the deviant practices of pornography and\nchild prostitution, of drug addiction and the sale of minors,\nmost common? Are these by chance the individual freedoms\nthey defend with such zeal? Why are they not equally\nintransigent in defence of the right to eat, to work, to learn,\nto live a healthy life, to not suffer discrimination by reason\nof sex or race, in other words the most basic rights of a\nhuman being?\nWe all recognize the responsibility of the United\nNations in the field of the promotion of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter. There are United Nations bodies that can\nadequately carry out this responsibility if attempts are not\nmade to assign them functions with which they are\nincompatible, if they are allowed to work objectively and\nwithout political conditions, and if they are based on\ncooperation and not imposition. This role must not and\ncannot be distorted. Thus, the idea of creating a high\ncommissioner for human rights should be considered with all\nnecessary care and without undue haste, which we could in\nthe future regret.\nIn a similar context, those who reap benefits from the\nexisting international order are introducing into it their own\nideology. They are trying to impose those norms of\npolitical, economic and social organization most likely to\npreserve that order and irrationally defend their ideas\nregarding the links between democracy, human rights and\nthe market economy, a new trilogy that masks the sufferings\nof millions of persons.\nIt is necessary firmly to reject any and all attempts to\ndecide unilaterally on these issues of vital interest to all\npeoples, and avoid their becoming new sources of conflict,\nnew obstacles to international cooperation and the unifying\nrole that humanity today expects of the United Nations.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 11\nIn order to fulfil the purposes enshrined in the United\nNations Charter and to allow the Organization to contribute\nto ensuring peace, cooperation and development, it is urgent\nto democratize the United Nations.\nThis would facilitate the finding of solutions to the\nmalformations with which the United Nations was born and\nwith which it developed, and its transformation into an\nOrganization devoted to truly strengthening cooperation\namong peoples. It is not acceptable that at the dawn of the\ntwenty-first century, the United Nations continues to respond\nto the interests of a handful of Powers.\nThe United Nations has not been and is not democratic.\nA veto privilege linked with the might of States is\ninadmissible, above all if the Security Council can become\na docile instrument in the hands of a few Powers, a risk\nwhich is present now more than ever before. There is\nnothing more insecure in this world, and I say this in all\nsincerity, than the Security Council.\nThe full democratization of the Security Council would\nrequire, among other measures, that all its members be\nsubject to periodic democratic elections, as is now the case\nwith non-permanent members. It would also require the\nelimination of the veto privilege and the establishment of a\nsingle category of members, which would be consistent with\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States that must\nbecome, once and for all, the cornerstone of the activities of\nthe Organization.\nWe are, nevertheless, conscious of the obstacles that at\npresent prevent us from achieving that objective, and we\nconsider it not only feasible, but indeed indispensable, to\nprogress in that direction.\nThe number of peoples present in this Hall has almost\nquadrupled since 1945. It is therefore necessary to institute\na new order in the United Nations.\nCuba favours an increase in the membership of the\nCouncil to reach a proportion, with respect to the total\nmembership of the United Nations, that is as close as\npossible to that existing in 1945, and favours also a tripling\nof the number of permanent members so that Latin America,\nthe Caribbean, Africa and Asia would have more than two\nseats in that category, as is now the case for Europe.\nSuffice it to say that more than 3,700 million inhabitants of\nthose continents, that is, two thirds of humankind, do not\nenjoy that privilege.\nIt is also essential for the principle of equitable\ngeographical distribution to be ever present in the Security\nCouncil, and not only among the non-permanent members\nbut among the totality of its membership. By so doing, we\nwould be advancing one step farther towards democratization\nof the Council\u2019s membership.\nIt is also indispensable to modify the operational\nmechanisms of the Council and eliminate the practice of\nso-called informal consultations, thereby increasing\ntransparency in the work of the Council. This is a need that\nthe Secretary-General recognizes in his latest report on the\nwork of the Organization. By the same token, it is not\npermissible for the Council to go beyond its mandate and\ninterfere in fields that are not within its purview.\nThe adoption of measures to ensure greater participation\nby the General Assembly on issues to do with the\nmaintenance and strengthening of international peace and\nsecurity, as a means for achieving the necessary balance\nbetween the Assembly and the Security Council, cannot be\npostponed. We cannot disregard the fact that, under the\nCharter, the General Assembly is the only truly universal\nbody in the United Nations and that this gives it special\nresponsibilities. The Security Council acts on behalf of all\nthe Member States represented in this Hall and is\naccountable to them. This accountability should therefore be\nimplemented through substantive and analytical reports from\nthe Council to the General Assembly that would allow the\nAssembly not only to systematically consider and assess the\nCouncil\u2019s activities, but also to formulate necessary\nrecommendations.\nThere is undoubtedly a general will to revitalize the\nOrganization, but this objective should be achieved through\nthe fullest and most transparent consultations, guided, above\nall, by the decisions taken by Member States.\nCertain recent initiatives that, without any consultation\nor mandate whatsoever, attempt to reinvent the priorities of\nthis Organization are cause for concern. There are even\nproposals that seem to consider the United Nations as a\nsupranational body with a Secretariat acting as a universal\ngovernment, and implementing actions that not only lack an\nappropriate legislative basis, but also confer on it\nprerogatives that are far removed from its legitimate nature.\nWe call the Assembly\u2019s attention to the dangers involved in\nthese attempts because, if their acceptance is forced through,\nthey would cause serious conflict that could endanger the\nvery integrity of the Organization.\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nAttention should also be called to the\nimplementation of certain new ideas and mechanisms in the\nUnited Nations. Even if the resolutions regarding the report\nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" were adopted unanimously\nin this Hall, their implementation is not free of dangers that\ncould jeopardize the most sacred principles of the United\nNations. Nothing in those texts can justify violations of the\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States\nor interference in their internal affairs.\nThe excessive multiplication in the number of\npeace-keeping operations and related procedures is also\ncause for increasing concern. The proliferation in this type\nof operation is no indication that the United Nations is\nfunctioning better today than in the past; quite the contrary.\nIn any case, it is a symptom of the grave dangers that\nthreaten world peace and stability.\nThe resulting financial burden that is falling on the\nshoulders of Member States is reaching unsustainable\nproportions. Hence, we must prevent this increase from\nbecoming even more onerous for Member States, and in\nparticular for those of the third world.\nIn the last decade of the millennium, our world\nnevertheless does show some rays of light. One of these is\nthat shed by the Ibero-American Summits, the most recent\nof which was recently held in the Brazilian city of\nSalvador da Bahia. I mention this as a valid example of\nfraternal discussion, in which, without anything being\nimposed by any party, issues of common interest were\ndefined and coordinated.\nRecently also, the world learned of the signing of the\nDeclaration that, as a preliminary measure, recognizes\nPalestinian autonomy over part of the occupied territories.\nWe hope that this development constitutes an effective step\ntowards the restoration of the legitimate right of the\nPalestinian people to have their own State, in their own\nnational territory, and towards the definitive withdrawal by\nIsrael from the other occupied Arab territories, including\nJerusalem. This would be an important contribution to a\ndefinitive solution to the Middle East conflict and to the\nestablishment of a just and lasting peace in that troubled\nregion.\nOnly a few days ago, in the Special Committee against\nApartheid, my delegation had the honour of hearing\nNelson Mandela. We are encouraged by his confidence in\nthe future, and we hope that the process of dialogue now\nunder way will be conducive to the establishment of a\nunited, democratic and non-racial South Africa. We are\nready to contribute, with our modest efforts, towards that\nend.\nIn my country, a genuine revolution succeeded. Since\nthe outset, it has faced hostility from its neighbour but,\nagainst all odds, it has been able to carry out, in solidarity,\nits humane task. We have continued our endeavour even\nnow that international circumstances have radically changed.\nCuba is inserting itself into the world economy and is\nopening up to foreign investment, but without the loss of any\nof its principles. In order to continue to safeguard the\ndevelopment of our people, we are also making profound\nchanges based on the concept of preserving our\nindependence and the gains we have already achieved. We\nare indeed facing serious problems as a result of an inhuman\nblockade, but we nevertheless continue to hold a prominent\nplace in the fields of health, education and social security,\nwhich are guaranteed for all even in the midst of all our\ndifficulties. The results of these efforts have been\nrecognized this year by the United Nations and by the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\nAttempts are being made to crush this dream. The\nGeneral Assembly, at its last session, adopted resolution\n47/19, regarding the necessity of ending the economic,\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the United\nStates of America against Cuba. The resolution was\nwelcomed by international public opinion. Since then, there\nhas been an impressive rise in world-wide solidarity towards\nour country, from every part of the world, from the most\ndiverse sectors and creeds, even in those wide swaths of the\npopulation of the aggressor country that reject the measures\ntaken by their own Government. Sympathy has increased\nfor a people that for more than three decades has managed\nto resist a ferocious siege by a huge, neighbouring Power,\nwith admirable gallantry in the midst of unimaginable\ndeprivation. Nevertheless, in open defiance of the decision\ntaken by the General Assembly and in defiance of world\nopinion, the blockade has been reinforced during the last few\nmonths by means of regulations cruelly implementing to the\nutmost the same laws rejected by this forum less than a year\nago.\nThe extra-territorial nature of the blockade has\nincreased, and the pressures are on the rise. Actions have\nmultiplied to impede or affect the links with Cuba of private\nand public economic entities in third countries. They aspire\nto defeat by hunger and disease the exemplary nation which\nthey have not been able to vanquish by force or by siren\nsongs.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 13\nIt must be difficult for the illustrious representatives of\nthat great northern nation still to sustain today the thesis that\ntheir actions constitute a bilateral embargo, in the face of the\nirrefutable evidence that in fact those actions constitute a\nblockade.\nWe have provided the Assembly with irrefutable\nevidence of their ambition not only to maintain but also to\nstrengthen the blockade, to economically strangle my\nhomeland, to undermine the sovereignty of third States and\nto violate the freedom of trade and navigation, to the\ndetriment of the most fundamental principles of international\nlaw.\nBut there is more: if this is a case of bilateral relations,\nthen there are two blockaded peoples, that of Cuba and that\nof the United States. North Americans are denied an\neconomic opportunity that would benefit them; they are\ndenied access to the scientific advances that already\nguarantee the prevention and cure of diseases such as\nmeningitis, retinitis pigmentosa, hepatitis B and vitiligo,\namong other achievements of our science. The right to\ntravel freely to any place, which their Constitution confers\non all citizens, is also infringed upon.\nThe blockade\u2019s effect on my people is even more\ninhuman. We are prevented from purchasing drugs essential\nfor health; our ability to acquire resources to meet the needs\nfor our material and social well-being is curtailed; our peace\nand daily life is threatened. The generation to which I\nbelong was born and grew up under the blockade\u2019s siege.\nTo live in a sovereign and steadfast country is a crime for\nwhich two million children may have to pay with their lives.\nWe affirm before the peoples of the world that there\nwill be no possible absolution for those who commit or\nsupport this genocide, because \\\"to condone a crime is\ntantamount to committing it\\\". If against all logic our right\nwere to be denied, if aggressive forces were to prevail over\nreason, Cubans will nevertheless always maintain their\nunshakeable faith in victory. We love life, and life is\nfreedom, independence, sovereignty. We demand that the\npath we have chosen be respected. It is not our desire to be\na model for anyone, but we will never accept either\nimposition or force.\nI know that my words will be understood in different\nways, but I have said what our conscience as free human\nbeings dictates. My words may be applauded as a matter of\nsolidarity, courtesy or obligation, but I know that there are\nmany who wish us to be successful, for that is what they\nhope for themselves.\nTo you, Mr. President, I am thankful for having\nallowed me to express the feelings of a worthy people.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by congratulating\nyou, Sir, upon your election to the presidency of the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly.\nI feel particularly privileged and honoured to address\nthe General Assembly on behalf of a people that struggled\nfor half a century to regain its fundamental human and\nnational rights and that, despite the outright military victory\nit won, took the unprecedented step of organizing a free and\nfair referendum so as to join the community of independent\nStates on the basis of its freely expressed wish and on solid\nlegal grounds.\nAs I speak here today, I cannot help but remember the\nappeals we sent year in and out to the General Assembly\nand the States Members of the United Nations, describing\nthe plight of our people and asking for legitimate sympathy,\nsupport and recognition. We appealed to the United Nations\nnot only in its capacity as a representative of the\ninternational community, but also because of its special\nresponsibility to Eritrea. For it was the United Nations that\ndecided in 1950, at the beginning of the cold war, to deny\nthe colonized people of Eritrea their right to\nself-determination, thereby sacrificing their national and\nhuman rights on the altar of the strategic interests of the\nsuper-Powers.\nIn adopting that resolution, the United Nations affirmed\nthat it remained an international instrument which the\nGeneral Assembly could be seized of at any time. But for\nthe next 41 years, as a brutal war of aggression was\nconducted against the Eritrean people, initially with the\nactive support of the United States and later with a much\nworse and massive involvement of the Soviet Union, and\ndespite the repeated appeals of the Eritrean people, the\nUnited Nations refused to raise its voice in the defence of a\npeople whose future it had unjustly decided and whom it had\npledged to protect. Not once in 41 years did Eritrea, scene\nof the longest war in Africa, and victim of some of the\ngrossest violations of human rights, figure in the agenda of\nthe United Nations.\nThis deafening silence pained our people. It also gave\na free hand to the aggressors, thereby prolonging our\nsuffering and increasing the sacrifices we had to make. But\nit neither shook our resolve nor undermined our belief in the\njustness of our cause and the inevitability of our victory. As\nan Eritrean proverb says: \\\"The rod of truth may become\nthinner but it cannot be broken.\\\" Indeed, justice has finally\nprevailed. This is a source of hope and happiness not only\nfor the Eritrean people, but for all those who cherish justice\nand peace.\nWhile we rejoice at the peace and freedom that have\nbeen attained and the promising prospects that lie ahead, we\nare confronted with the reality of a devastated country and\npopulation. The extent of the physical and economic\ndestruction visited on our country, in terms of infrastructure,\nindustry, agriculture, education and health services, as well\nas the more painful human losses - the death of over\n150,000 people, the exile of a quarter of the population,\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 9\nmassive displacement, and over 100,000 disabled and\norphaned - are appalling by any standard, especially when\nmeasured against the meagre resources and small size of our\npopulation.\nFormidable as our problems are, we are confident that\nwe can and will rebuild our devastated country and provide\na decent life for ourselves. It is our firm conviction that\noutside assistance, no matter how generous, cannot of itself\nsolve our problems. Ultimately, deliverance will depend on\nour own efforts, on the mobilization and efficient utilization\nof our resources. But as we start to clear the rubble and\npick up the pieces after three decades of war and destruction,\nwe find that our resources are too limited for the awesome\ntask of rehabilitation and jump-starting our economy. We\ncannot help but ask: Will the United Nations and the\ninternational community come to our assistance this time or\nwill our pleas once again go unheeded?\nAt this critical juncture of its history, Eritrea needs and\ndeserves international support and assistance, not only\nbecause the United Nations and the international community\nbear special responsibility for Eritrea, but also because it is\na test case for the United Nations \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and\nthe whole concept of peace-building. Eritrea has not only\nsecured peace and stability; it has made the rare achievement\nof establishing warm relations of cooperation with its former\nenemy, Ethiopia. And it is tackling the task of\nreconstruction with popular support and participation, with\ncommitment and determination, with sound and flexible\npolicies, with prudent and efficient utilization of limited\nresources, and with a demonstrated readiness to promote\nregional understanding and cooperation.\nUnfortunately, the response of the United Nations and\nthe international community so far has not been encouraging.\nThough the active involvement of the United Nations in the\nreferendum was generally commendable, United Nations\ncontributions to the Eritrean referendum - one of the most\nsuccessful electoral processes in which the United Nations\nhas ever been involved - was less than $2 million, a meagre\nsum compared to the tens of millions of dollars devoted to\nsimilar exercises, many of which were dismal failures.\nSimilarly, the response of the international community to the\nprogramme for the repatriation of half a million Eritrean\nrefugees from the Sudan fell far short of reasonable\nexpectations, and the Government has found no alternative\nbut to start the programme regardless of funds and expected\nproblems. Eritrea has also embarked on a crucial\ndemobilization programme - it has demobilized close to one\nthird of its 90,000-man army in the first phase - without\nUnited Nations or other contribution. It had to cut back\nsome of its rehabilitation and development projects and\nborrow money to finance this first phase.\nIn our efforts at mobilizing international resources, we\nhave repeatedly been met with such excuses as \\\"a lack of\nfunds\\\", \\\"competing demands\\\", \\\"more pressing priorities\\\" and\n\\\"donor fatigue\\\". There well may be some truth in all of this.\nAnd we are appreciative of the constraints and commendable\nefforts of some donors. But, I believe, we cannot and\nshould not hesitate to acknowledge that, by and large, the\ninternational aid programme is deeply flawed, unfair, unjust\nand ill-structured to respond to the vital needs of recipient\ncommunities. Assistance and the amounts of assistance\nappear to be decided, not on the basis of need or the\ncapacity to put the assistance to good use, but - even after\nthe proclamation of the end of the cold war - on the basis of\nthe interests and agendas of donors. Moreover, the\ninternational community tends to be more responsive to\nputting out fires than to preventing them, and once the fires\nare put out it often turns its back on the smouldering\ncombustible remains.\nOne of the most disquieting features of the present\ninternational situation is the marginalization of the entire\ncontinent of Africa. Every indicator shows that Africa is\nsliding back and being left behind, which results in\nintolerable poverty, suffering and desperation for millions of\nits people. There is no denying that the onus of the\nresponsibility for these problems falls first and foremost on\nus Africans. But, I believe, the international community\nmust squarely face the fact that it also bears responsibility\nfor Africa\u2019s plight. Many of the dictators who have sown so\nmuch havoc and suffering were in fact brought to power and\nsustained during the years of the cold war by sections of the\ninternational community. Perhaps more significant is the\nfact that the now discredited economic policies and failed\nprojects were generally designed and approved by\ninternational donors and implemented under the direction of\nan army of foreign experts and advisers.\nIn our present highly interlinked world, Africa\u2019s\nmarginalization, the poverty and desperation of its people, of\nits youth, cannot be walled in within the continent\u2019s\nboundaries. They are bound to threaten global prosperity\nand stability. The frustration and resentment that continue\nto swell and may well explode must be defused in time.\nOnce again Africa must seize its own destiny. Its people\nand leaders must tap deep into their human and material\nresources and come up with the wisdom, strategy and\ncommitment to lift Africa from the mire. But as they set out\non this difficult road the international community needs to\ncome to their assistance, not with hand-outs that only\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nincrease dependency, not with the familiar packages and\nprojects that have gone down the drain, not with\npreconceived formulas and attitudes of \\\"We know what is\nbest\\\", but in a spirit of partnership dedicated to helping\nAfrica to stand on its own feet and contribute to the\nenrichment of human life and the protection of the\nenvironment.\nOf course, not everything in Africa has been bleak.\nJust as gross human failure is not limited to Africa - witness\nevents in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Soviet Union\nand elsewhere - Africa has its share of positive and uplifting\ndevelopments and successes. We are following with much\ninterest the determined and promising efforts of several\nAfrican countries, both at the individual country level and\nwithin a regional context. Despite the neglect and inequities\nof the international community, many African peoples are\nmaking a determined assault on poverty and social injustice.\nIn our part of the continent, Eritrea and Ethiopia have\nalready started mutually beneficial economic cooperation,\nand, together with the other countries of the Horn, are\nworking to set up a regional mechanism to foster peace and\ncooperation. We strongly believe all of the many positive\ndevelopments in Africa should be duly recognized.\nIn view of the positive developments in the Horn of\nAfrica, the tragedy that has gripped Somalia has been\nprofoundly disturbing. As the bloodletting among our\nSomali brothers assumed harrowing proportions, and at a\ntime when many were hesitating, we strongly advocated the\nconstructive intervention of the international community,\nunder the umbrella of the United Nations, to save lives and\nhelp extricate Somalia from the destruction it was heading\nfor. Despite our opposition in principle to external military\nintervention, we realized early on that the extraordinary\nsituation in Somalia demanded extraordinary measures.\nIt was therefore with great relief that we welcomed the\ndecision of the United States Administration to intervene in\nSomalia. Encouraged, we sought - individually and in\nconjunction with our regional partners - to ensure that the\nintervention would be guided by clear and comprehensive\nsecurity, and humanitarian and political objectives. And we\ndid not hesitate to share our views on the size, type and\nlength of stay of the intervention force needed for the\nsuccess of the mission. But unfortunately our views were\nnot heeded, although we were, and still are, better placed to\nunderstand and work in the realities of neighbouring\nSomalia.\nBe that as it may, we recognize and appreciate the\nachievements of the international intervention in Somalia.\nThe improvement of the humanitarian situation and the\nMarch 1993 Addis Ababa Accords on national reconciliation\nare major steps forward. At the same time, the worsening\nsecurity situation in Mogadishu and the increasing toll in\nhuman lives, including women and children, have cast a long\nshadow on the intervention in Somalia. Repeated mistakes\nin handling the situation have led some people openly to call\nfor an immediate end to the intervention.\nIt is our conviction that a precipitate withdrawal of\nUnited States troops - which we strongly warned against\nfrom the beginning - would not only signal a lack of United\nStates commitment to the intervention, but would eventually\nmake the position of the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia (UNOSOM II) untenable. This would plunge\nSomalia into a catastrophe much worse than the anarchy that\nprompted the intervention in the first place. We therefore\nurge the United States and the international community at\nlarge to stay the course in Somalia and to shoulder their\nresponsibility to the Somali people in the hour of their\ngreatest need. We also urge them to review, frankly and\ndispassionately, the intervention to date, build on the\nsuccesses and achievements and, more importantly, admit\nand correct mistakes.\nWe sincerely believe that the countries of the region,\nwhose role has so far been deliberately or otherwise\nneglected, can make a constructive contribution to the\ninternational effort. Consulting them informally every once\nin a while, as has been the case in the past, is clearly not\nenough. They need to become part of the process in a more\nmeaningful and formalized way, as it concerns and affects\nthem directly and more than anyone outside the region.\nThe advent of the new State of Eritrea happily\ncoincided with the end of the cold war, that era of\nsuper-Power rivalry that caused so much human misery and\nled to the virtual paralysis of the United Nations. Like the\nrest of humanity, we place much hope on the new era, on\nthe prospects of an enhanced role for the United Nations, a\nrole that would make it truly representative of \\\"We, the\npeoples of the world\\\". And yet we have no illusions that a\nnew, just and equitable world order has dawned. We see too\nmany old habits and practices - inside the United Nations\nand outside it - to entertain any illusions. Although we hope\nfor successes, we see that the failures of United Nations\ninitiatives far outnumber any of its successes. Injustice\nendures within nations and between nations.\nWe are awed by the challenges that continue to face\nhumanity and are deeply aware of our minuscule capabilities.\nStill, Eritrea is determined to make its own small\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 11\ncontribution to the betterment of human life in its own\ncorner of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to pay tribute to the wisdom of the\nAssembly in electing Ambassador Insanally to preside over\nthis session, thus highlighting the outstanding role of his\ncountry, the Republic of Guyana, and beyond it that of Latin\nAmerica in international relations.\nI also wish to congratulate the members of the Bureau\nand to extend to the outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\nour warm congratulations on the excellent work done during\nhis mandate.\nI should also like to reaffirm the full confidence of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in the Secretary-General ,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny,\nwho has met him several times this year, greatly appreciates\nhis impartiality and ability and his great devotion to his\nduties to the international community.\nFinally, my delegation congratulates and welcomes the\nStates admitted since the last session to our Organization,\nwhich is thus moving ever closer to its objective of\nuniversality.\nThe substantial transformations that have taken place in\nthe world since 1989 have given rise to profound changes in\ninternational relations. All the points of reference that\nallowed us to analyse these relations with certitude have\ndisappeared. The new atmosphere of confidence and the\nspirit of understanding, and at times of solidarity, that\nprevail in relations between States and peoples give grounds\nfor hope and the rapid advent of a new international order\nthat will be more stable, more just and more able to meet the\naspirations of peoples for shared happiness in a world that\nhungers for bread and thirsts for truth. Today\u2019s world is\nmoving towards a convergence around certain values,\nincluding the primacy of respect for human rights, the\nimperative need for democracy, development and\ndisarmament and the leading role of law in international\nrelations. Such development can only give rise to great\nhopes by opening up the possibility of correcting past\nmistakes, sharing the benefits of progress with all and\nensuring the fullness of peace.\nWith the beginning of real disarmament and the recent\nsigning of the Convention banning chemical weapons, the\nrelationship between war and peace is today undergoing a\nclear qualitative change. Unfortunately, however, we must\nrecognize that the international situation is far from\nsatisfying our hopes for justice and lasting peace.\nIndeed, the collapse of the bipolar world seems,\nparadoxically, to have opened the door for new threats to\ninternational peace and security. The accumulation of poorly\nbandaged wounds, blind ambitions and feelings of rivalry\nand hatred built up over decades has re-emerged in various\nregions of the world in the form of extremely devastating\nand brutal fratricidal conflicts. Thus, Europe, whose level of\nsocio-economic development did not prevent it from\ndestroying itself twice in less than thirty years, is today still\nin the grip of a terrible conflict in the former Yugoslavia.\nThat anachronistic and indescribably barbarous war has\njustified the creation, for the first time within the United\nNations system, of an international penal tribunal, under\nSecurity Council resolution 827 (1993). So too, Africa,\npushed aside by the disappearance of the bipolar world, has\nbeen torn by numerous internal conflicts with unfortunate\nconsequences for the entire continent, which needs, rather,\nstability and peace within African States, between African\nStates and between Africa and the rest of the world in order\nto deal with the imperative needs of its development and\neconomic integration.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be of great\nconcern, despite the presence of the United Nations peace-\nkeeping forces, for the spectre of anarchy, intolerance in all\nits forms and violence continues to hover over that country.\nWe hope that the tireless and commendable efforts of the\ninternational community to re-establish peace in that country\nwill, within the allotted time, lead to a positive conclusion\nand the reconciliation of all its sons and daughters.\nWe also hope to see very soon a resolution of the\nconflict in Liberia. Recent developments in that brotherly\nand neighbourly country, which led to the conclusion of the\nCotonou Agreement on 25 July 1993, tend to make us more\noptimistic about the rapid restoration of peace.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has always wished fervently to see the\nre-establishment of peace in Liberia and has, in addition,\nacted along these lines, as the Yamassoukro Accords attest.\nWe are gratified by the formation in that country of a\ntransitional government in the form of a State council\nentrusted with the organization of general elections. We\nwelcome the firm determination of the political elements in\nLiberia to work for the ultimate collapse of the wall of\nhatred and enmity between Liberian brothers and thus to lay\nthe foundation for a future of peace and prosperity for all.\nIn this context it is urgent that the international community\ncommit itself further to finding the necessary means for the\nrapid deployment of new contingents to reinforce the\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\nMilitary Observer Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia to promote\nthe effective implementation of the provisions of the\nCotonou Agreement, particularly with regard to the entry\ninto force of the Council of State, disarmament and the\ncantonment of factions. It is equally urgent that the\ninternational community come to the assistance, within the\nframework of Chapter VIII of the Charter, of States or\nregional organizations, participating in peace-keeping efforts\nin Liberia. It is also necessary that the question of the\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance be rapidly resolved to\nallow for the regular supply of those regions of Liberia\nwhere famine is raging in order to prevent the incursions of\narmed bands in search of food that attack border villages and\nhamlets. Here we should like to congratulate all the non-\ngovernmental organizations that are making every effort,\nwith courage, tenacity and dedication, to save human lives\nin that strife-torn country.\nIt is also fitting to welcome the conclusion of the\nInternational Conference for the Protection of War Victims\nheld at Geneva from 3 August to 2 September this year,\norganized by the Swiss Government and the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross. That Conference allowed for\na reaffirmation of the provisions of the major treaties of\ninternational humanitarian law aimed at the protection of\npopulations during armed conflicts and for sensitizing public\nopinion concerning the valid bases of those provisions and\nthe plight of civilian victims.\nConcerning Angola, progress made at the outset in the\napplication of the Bicesse peace agreements in May 1991\nnow needs to be maintained, and efforts must be made and\nencouraged, both in the Security Council and in African\nforums, for the achievement of a just and lasting peace.\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire knows only two paths for the settlement\nof conflicts: resort to force or resort to negotiation, that is\nto say, dialogue. Recent events in the international arena\nhave consecrated the value of dialogue, which has always\nbeen advocated by President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, for\nthe peaceful settlement of all conflicts. They clearly indicate\nhow dialogue, conducted by responsible individuals, can,\nregardless of the nature of the conflict, serve as an extremely\nuseful instrument for peace.\nIn South Africa, the recent developments in the political\nsituation are most encouraging, despite the uncertainties of\nthe moment resulting from the escalation of violence. For\nthis reason we welcome with satisfaction the joint statement\nof the political parties of South Africa concerning their\nintention to organize free and democratic elections in April\n1994. We also welcome the establishment of an executive\ntransition council that, for the first time in three centuries of\nwhite domination, after the first multiracial elections will\ninvolve the black majority in political matters.\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe send out an urgent appeal to those elements\nopposed to democratic changes in South Africa to refrain\nfrom acts likely to jeopardize the sensitive negotiation\nprocess, which would delay South Africa\u2019s return to the\nfamily of nations. We welcome the new spirit inspiring the\nSouth African leaders, particularly Mr. De Klerk and Mr.\nMandela, a spirit that led to the historic request made by the\nAfrican National Congress (ANC) to the international\ncommunity to lift the economic and diplomatic sanctions\nslapped on South Africa. We also welcome the agreement\nreached between the South African and Namibian\nGovernments concerning the transfer of the port of Walvis\nBay and the surrounding islands to the jurisdiction of the\nNamibian Government.\nIn the Middle East we can finally discern, after so\nmany years of war and built-up hatred, the prospect of a\nsettlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The mutual\nrecognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) and the signing in Washington on 13\nSeptember of the historic agreement on Gaza and Jericho\nconvince us that the process begun in the Middle East is\nnow irreversible, despite the obstacles that might arise on the\nroad to peace.\nThis is the moment to hail the courage, lucidity and\nself-abnegation of the high Israeli and Palestinian officials\nwho have risen above circumstances and resolutely chosen\npeace. Their ardour in working for peace after such a\nlengthy period of war has been recognized and saluted by\nthe international community. It is quite fitting that the\nmembers of the jury for the Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize,\nestablished by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\nCultural Organization, unanimously awarded the Prize for\n1993 to those illustrious leaders of Israel and Palestine.\nAs for the situation in the Gulf, where peace is still\nprecarious, we reiterate our unswerving support for the full\nimplementation of all resolutions on this conflict, particularly\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991, as\nwell as resolution 833 (1993). We call on the parties\nconcerned to respect these provisions. We believe that this\nresolution is a major asset in assuring security and stability\nin the region.\nIn Asia, we welcome the outcome of the conflict in\nCambodia, where the United Nations undertook one of the\nmost ambitious and complex peace-keeping operations it had\never conducted. We congratulate the members of the United\nNations Secretariat and the States that supplied various\ncontingents for the success of this operation, which allows\nworld public opinion fully to appreciate this other activity of\nthe United Nations which is too often ignored.\nIf the conflicts born of the cold war are now beginning\nto find solutions, it is none the less clear that we have\nentered upon a period of uncertainty, questioning and\ninstability, with the re-emergence of a number of secondary\nconflicts that had been effectively frozen or repressed during\nthe cold war and that are essentially of ethnic, tribal or\nreligious origin, as illustrated by the wrenching events in\nNagorny-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the former Yugoslavia.\nIt is becoming clear as well that in today\u2019s world there are\nfewer and fewer identifiable enemies and more and more\nproblems that are very difficult to identify.\nThe United Nations remains the indispensable recourse\nfor confronting these conflicts. Here, we solemnly wish to\nstate our full support for the proposals of the Secretary-\nGeneral contained in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nThe strengthening of preventive action by the United\nNations must prompt us to pursue the process of\nrestructuring and revitalization of its bodies to allow it to\ncope with these new challenges. Given the dominant role of\nthe Security Council in peace-keeping and international\nsecurity, the question of equitable representation in that body\nshould allow for a lengthy reflection so as to find a solution\nacceptable to all - in this case, the expansion of the Security\nCouncil to accord with the growth in the number of our\nOrganization\u2019s Members and in the complexity of the\nproblems submitted to it.\nSuch an expansion should be based on rigorous and\nobjective criteria which we need to define together, bearing\nin mind the imperative need for effectiveness in the taking\nand implementation of Security Council decisions. The\nUnited Nations, as a reflection of universal values, cannot\nstand outside the trend towards democratization which is\nsweeping across the world.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\nVienna last June, was of pivotal importance, allowing for a\nreaffirmation of human rights. If we can rightly be gratified\nby the fact that this Conference recognized the right to\ndevelopment as a fundamental human right to the disastrous\neconomic situation in numerous regions of the world, and\nparticularly in Africa, should remind us here of the need for\na general awareness of the fact that human rights cannot\nflourish in a context of poverty and misery.\nIn looking back over the economic situation, we note\nthat global economic activity in 1992 was characterized by\na slow recovery, growing by only 1.1 per cent. This weak\nrecovery is primarily the result of a moderate growth in the\nglobal production of the industrialized countries, as well as\na noticeable drop in the total production of those countries\nwhich formerly had planned economies. Unfortunately,\nthese trends continued in 1993, and thus we are seeing a rise\nin unemployment and the emergence of serious social\ntensions throughout the world.\nThese not very optimistic elements observed in the\nindustrialized countries can only have negative consequences\nfor other countries, particularly those of the developing\nworld, among which the African countries remain the most\nvulnerable.\nWe can therefore hardly be surprised that in the last\nUnited Nations Development Programme report on human\ndevelopment in 173 countries, 41 of the 53 African countries\nare among the 50 last countries in the classification. These\npessimistic conclusions were reaffirmed in the reports of the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nWe are aware of the causes of this serious recession.\nAside from the drop in economic activities in numerous\nindustrialized countries, those causes are the collapse of\ncommodity prices - for minerals, mining and agriculture -\nand the subsequent exacerbation of the foreign-debt burden\non our economies, which in turn limits our investment\ncapability. Additional causes that should be noted are the\ngeneral inadequacies in economic management as described\nin the World Bank study entitled \\\"The African Capacity-\nBuilding Initiative\\\". All these factors taken together have\nled to the present crisis in our countries, manifested above\nall by a drastic drop in economic growth and an intolerable\nrise in unemployment, particularly among our young people\n- the driving force of our countries.\nThe image this brief sketch of the African economic\nand social climate projects is hardly encouraging. In the\nface of such a situation, we believe that prospects for seeing\nthe advocated solutions succeed lie primarily in a consistent\napproach to them.\nOur States have had the political courage to embark\nupon deep-rooted economic reforms and our peoples have\nprogressively become aware of the need for the adjustment\neffort. Thus in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for several years now, we\nhave been implementing a set of measures of economic\npolicy aimed at creating the conditions for economic\nrecovery. The stabilization phase of this process has\nprimarily tended towards putting our public finances on a\nsounder footing, which is basic to the revival of our\neconomy and its integration into a larger collective within\nthe region and throughout the continent.\nThe extension of the democratic process in Africa is\nevident. But it is also clear that there can be no democracy\nwithout economic development, nor genuine sustainable\ndevelopment without democracy. One of the primary\nconditions of this development for our countries is just\nremuneration in primary commodities - mineral, mining and\nagricultural.\nStatistics show that Africa represents only 2 per cent of\nthe value of world trade, and that inter-African trade\nrepresents only 5 per cent of the value of the region\u2019s total\nexternal trade. These data remind us once again of the\neconomic urgency for Africa to achieve genuine economic\nintegration within the continent.\nIn West Africa, this exercise has already begun, in\nparticular within the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), whose treaty has just been revised, and\nabove all within the West African Monetary Union\n(WAMU), with the upcoming establishment of the West\nAfrican Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).\nFrom our point of view, such an exercise in structuring\nand harmonizing the institutional and legal framework of\neconomic integration should be carried out and should\nrapidly be extended to all regions of Africa in order to pave\nthe way for the building of the African Common Market,\nwhich we all so wish to see.\nIt is also appropriate to note the great hopes we place\non the establishment of the African Import-Export Bank,\nwhose primary objectives will be to increase the level of\nAfrican exports and of inter-African trade. We should also\nnote the significant progress made in laying the groundwork\nfor an expanded cooperation between our States in several\nareas, such as those of business law, the insurance industry,\nand the establishment of a body for regional statistics.\nWe wish here particularly to emphasize the extremely\nimportant role played in the area of financing by the African\nDevelopment Bank in implementing the objectives of\nintegration in Africa. We must hail the will this institution\ndemonstrates in its efforts to establish positive correlations\nbetween actions implemented within the framework of\nstructural adjustment programmes and the objectives of\nregional economic integration. This step by the African\nDevelopment Bank affects the central elements of the\ndevelopment strategies of African countries.\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIt goes without saying that such integration can be\nimplemented only in an environment which is one of peace,\nstability and security. We therefore welcomed the creation,\nwithin the OAU and ECOWAS, of machinery for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts.\nWe must recognize that our efforts at regional\nintegration will remain futile as long as the global economic\nenvironment remains unfavourable and as long as our\npartners in the developed countries lack the necessary\npolitical will resolutely to tackle our countries\u2019 problems in\nthis interdependent world of solidarity.\nAt a time when the marginalization of Africa is\nincreasing, we welcome the positive initiative of the\nGovernment of Japan to hold, several days from now in\nTokyo, the International Conference on African\nDevelopment, which will allow the developed countries to\nbetter grasp the specific problems of Africa.\nWe must acknowledge, however, that any assistance\noffered by the international community will be only a small\ncontribution, given the magnitude of the development needs\nof the African continent. This assistance will be effective\nonly if consistent and lasting solutions are found to our\nproblems within the framework of an international\ncooperation even further based on interdependence and\nsolidarity, in particular in the areas of international trade,\nforeign debt, the environment, the war on drugs, and the\nimportant question of raw materials, to avoid confining our\ncountries to the exclusive role of purveyors of raw materials\nand allow them also, through the transformation of these\nproducts, to become consumers in trade relations.\nMore specifically, the Rio Conference, by adopting\nAgenda 21, reached a consensus on the planetary level\nconcerning the need for immediate and bold international\ncooperation in the area of sustainable development and the\nenvironment. In applying Agenda 21, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for its\npart, has established regional environmental committees to\ndraw up its white book on the environment, which will help\nit zero in on the objectives laid down in the Agenda.\nIn this context, the elaboration of an international\nconvention on the struggle against desertification is of\ncritical importance for Africa, and we continue to place our\nhopes in the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating\nCommittee on that convention.\nUltimately, given the importance and complexity of the\nareas affecting the question of the environment, it is\nindispensable for the international community to openly\nsupport the development efforts of the African countries by\ngranting them adequate financial resources and by helping\nthem strengthen their scientific and technical capacities.\nConcerning the question of drugs and its financial\nramifications, the gravity of these issues requires that the\ninternational community give them serious thought. The\nmost recent studies of this phenomenon indicate that Africa\nhas become one of the major centres for this illegal traffic.\nAt the same time, we note that local consumption of hard\ndrugs, in particular heroin and cocaine, are notably\nincreasing in numerous African countries.\nThis represents, therefore, a global scourge against\nwhich individual States are doomed from the outset, for the\nravages of drugs spare no continent and no country,\nregardless of how powerful they may be.\nAfrica is the weak link from which the international\ndrug trade profits. Thus, given the extreme vulnerability and\nthe precarious nature of the means available to the African\ncontinent to combat this danger, the international community\nshould supply - specifically through the United Nations Drug\nControl Programme, with which my country is fruitfully\ncooperating - the needed financial resources.\nSince the end of the bipolar war, history has speeded\nup. We are the privileged witnesses of political events of\nthe highest importance, events that will shape international\nrelations along the lines of a rapprochement among nations\nand will therefore contribute to the strengthening of peace\nand global security, essential foundations for the building of\na more just world order and one of greater solidarity.\nHowever, despite the dynamics of peace, which promise\nbetter tomorrows, we must admit that the ideas of peace and\nsecurity can no longer be limited solely to the political field,\nfor the truth is that peace and security can be genuine only\nif economic development and social progress are ensured for\nall.\nThe effective globalization of the economy as well as\nthe ever-increasing interdependence of nations today requires\nalso an acceleration of history on the level of international\neconomic relations, for the world must become aware of the\nfact that there can be no lasting peace, no universal\nprosperity, if the greatest part of humankind is on the\nsidelines of economic development and social well-being.\nIn such a context, therefore, the North-South dialogue\nmust be reactivated with the goal of seeing that further\nmeans are established to eradicate underdevelopment and\npoverty, which today represent the greatest threat of our era.\nFor peace does not coexist well with poverty, as President\nFelix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny often says.\nThe capability of the international community to grasp\nthis danger and to find rapid and lasting solutions will\ndetermine our joint survival.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I take great pleasure in expressing to\nthe President of the General Assembly the sincerest\ncongratulations of the people and the Government of\nHonduras on his well-deserved election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nIn entrusting this very delicate role to him, the\ninternational community is recognizing his personal merits\nand those of our sister nation of Guyana. We are convinced\nthat with his experience and proven capacity he will conduct\nthe work of this Assembly with great success.\nMy delegation also extends a warm welcome to the\nnew Members of our Organization: the Czech Republic, the\nSlovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Andorra and the Principality of Monaco.\nWe do so fully convinced that within the framework of the\nUnited Nations we will establish and strengthen strong bonds\nof friendship and cooperation with them, and that their\nparticipation will contribute effectively to the full realization\nof the principles and purposes enshrined in the United\nNations Charter.\nPursuant to those same principles, the Republic of\nHonduras calls, as it did at the previous session of the\nGeneral Assembly, for greater support and resources to be\naccorded to the universal organs for the legal settlement of\ndisputes, such as the International Court of Justice, whose\nrulings contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes\nbrought before it. We are pleased to state that a year ago\nHonduras and El Salvador were handed down a ruling by the\nInternational Court of Justice on their border dispute; we are\nnow complying with that ruling and the border populations\nare living in complete harmony.\nOn the question of disarmament, in taking note of the\nvital discussion of the destructive power of nuclear weapons,\nwe urge the nuclear-weapon States to arrive at sound,\nverifiable agreements on the reduction and destruction of\nsuch weapons and their means of delivery, taking into\naccount the great danger the use of these and other weapons\nof mass destruction represents for humanity, and ensuring\nthat the growing financial resources released from the arms\nrace are transferred to the needs arising from international\ncooperation for development.\nIt is only natural that, in activities in the field of\ngeneral disarmament, priority should have been given to\nnuclear disarmament, but this must not impede renewed\nefforts in the field of conventional disarmament, particularly\non a regional basis.\nHonduras has observed with great concern the tragic\nsituation still prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the\nescalation of hostilities, massive violations of human rights\nand attempts to enshrine in legal instruments territorial\nconquests obtained by aggression.\nMy country therefore unreservedly supports the Security\nCouncil\u2019s efforts to protect the displace populations, to\nprovide them with food, medicine and protection, and to\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nobtain a cease-fire and a solution to the various problems\nthat stand in the way of restoring peace to the region.\nIn Somalia, there is no national government to ensure\nthat the United Nations intervention in that country will not\nonly mitigate the hunger which unfortunately afflicts its\ninhabitants but also make it possible, with the full\nparticipation of the Somalis, to follow the path to peace,\ncoexistence and the restoration of normalcy.\nThat path of hope has already been taken with great\ndetermination in South Africa, and the international\ncommunity is rejoicing at the end of the last vestiges of\napartheid and the beginning of national reconciliation and\nreconstruction.\nIt was with rekindled hope that the entire world learned\nof the outcome of the negotiations which, under the inspired\nmediation of the Government of Norway, led to the recently\nsigned historic agreement on mutual recognition between the\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.\nThis is one more step towards the normalization of good-\nneighbourly relations in the Middle East with respect to the\nright to self-determination of peoples.\nThe Honduran Government, which has followed with\ninterest and concern the fierce struggle that for decades has\npitted Israelis and Arabs against each other, welcomes this\npositive development and hopes it will be accompanied by\npeace agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\nSimilarly, our country has followed with great attention\nthe course of events in Haiti, where we have welcomed the\nagreement reached between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\nand the head of the country\u2019s armed forces, through the\nmediation of Mr. Dante Caputo, the Special Envoy of the\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States (OAS).\nThe text of this agreement, in addition to contemplating\na series of basic provisions for the solution of the crisis,\ncalls for the return of Haiti\u2019s legitimate President, and for\ncompliance with all commitments undertaken both in the\nUnited Nations and in the OAS. Our country expresses its\nresolute support for all measures that may be taken to\ncomply with the timetable established in the Governors\nIsland Agreement, which led to the parliamentary ratification\nof Prime Minister Robert Malval, which in turn has made it\npossible to suspend the embargo on Haiti.\nIn Central America, the Tegucigalpa Protocol of\n13 December 1991 has entered into force. It adapts the legal\nframework of the former Organization of Central American\nStates to the new realities of the region by establishing a\nsystem of Central American Integration which, acting under\nthe impetus of the regional summits, is strengthening and\nfostering a new system of economic, social, cultural and\npolitical integration for the benefit of all Central Americans.\nIn accordance with this basic objective, my country\naspires, with increasing determination and political will, to\nsee our region established as a region of peace, freedom,\ndemocracy and development which is more actively involved\nin the new reordering of the international community.\nHowever, in spite of the progress in the regional peace\nprocess, many of the root causes of the Central American\ncrisis persist, and the advances that have been made are only\na starting-point in confronting the underlying causes of the\narmed conflict which threaten to destroy all that has been\naccomplished.\nPeace and development will be securely established\nonly if a broad and participatory commitment is achieved,\ninvolving both the Governments and the organized sectors of\ncivilian society of each of our nations.\nIt is a fact that the difficulties of any one Central\nAmerican country have an effect on all other countries of the\nregion. Concerted action within a regional framework is\ntherefore necessary, to allow internal processes to be\nstrengthened while fully respecting the particular\ncircumstances of each country.\nThe Government of Honduras therefore appeals to our\nfellow Central Americans to meet in the near future in order\nto give a new thrust to coordination of the efforts which\nbenefit from international support and to make it possible for\nus to view with hope the economic integration now under\nway.\nThe challenge of establishing peace in Central America\nrequires that we give priority to the geographical areas most\naffected by poverty. This in turn requires us to promote\ngreater social participation by deepening the process of\ndecentralization through a concept of human development at\nthe local level and expressing that social development in\nrealistic macroeconomic policies which encourage both\ndomestic and foreign investment.\nIn Honduras this year we will be holding our fifth\nconsecutive general election since the restoration of\ndemocracy in 1980, and it is our policy to give firm support\nto the economic integration of the Central American isthmus\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 47\nin order to consolidate the results of growth with greater\nsocial well-being.\nA revitalized Central America with sustainable\neconomic growth, while respecting the natural environment\nand continually acting to rapidly improve the quality of life\nof its inhabitants, is the best guarantee of permanent security\nfor the region bathed by the Caribbean Sea, within which\nCentral America, in harmony with the principles of the\nmember countries of the \\\"Community of the Caribbean\\\", can\nconsolidate an era of peace and cooperation by the end of\nthis century.\nThe third Ibero-American summit, held at San Salvador\nde Bahia, Brazil, examined with concern the subject of\ndevelopment, with emphasis on social development. In so\ndoing, it reaffirmed in that community of nations the\ncommitment to representative democracy, the promotion of\nthe observance and defence of human rights, and the\npromotion of the economic and social development of our\npeoples, which are united by language, tradition and by a\nshared future.\nTo follow up on what was decided in this new forum\nfor cooperation, we Ibero-Americans must strengthen our\ncommitment to the successful convening of the World\nSummit for Social Development, an initiative of the Chilean\nGovernment supported enthusiastically by Honduras, and\nwhich we hope will be given a final impetus by this General\nAssembly.\nThere can be no doubt that all of these attempts to\nachieve prosperity for our nations must inevitably involve a\nwillingness on the part of the industrialized States to include\nus in trying to establish an open, multilateral trade system\nthat gives our products greater access to competitive markets\nso that more and more countries can reach satisfactory levels\nof growth and trade.\nUnfortunately, the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\nNegotiations has not yet been concluded, and this is a source\nof grave concern to the less developed States whose\nexpectations are affected along with the programmes of\nstructural adjustment they are carrying out with great\nsacrifice, as an effective contribution to a better ordering of\nthe world economy. Protectionist measures imposed by\ncertain States on exports from our region not only cause a\ndecline in the prices of those products but also impede\naccess to international markets, thus helping to plunge our\neconomies into a climate of uncertainty by restricting the\npossibilities of investment and continued growth.\nThe need to achieve greater global economic stability\nwithout regard to the economic and political might of any\nindividual nation should be examined along with the growing\nconvergence of opinions concerning global priorities with\nregard to the environment; this was demonstrated in a clear\nand positive way at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro\nlast year.\nThe deterioration of nature must be avoided. Together\nwe can design preservation strategies that also make it\npossible to make rational use of our natural resources in\norder to meet our countries\u2019 requirements for employment\nneeds and economic growth. In Honduras, we have\nestablished a Ministry of the Environment charged with\ndesigning policies and strategies aimed at creating\nmechanisms to protect and preserve our ecosystem and its\nendangered species of flora and fauna.\nLastly, as regards the restructuring of the United\nNations, Honduras supports the proposal that the Security\nCouncil be expanded to include new permanent and non-\npermanent members so as to reflect the realities of today\u2019s\nworld, allowing for the rotation of membership and an\nequitable geographical distribution in the composition of the\nCouncil.\nWe are also in favour of the revitalization of the United\nNations in the economic, social, cultural and related spheres.\nIt is essential that the necessary measures be adopted as soon\nas possible to strengthen the capacity of those organs\nconcerned in order to discharge the functions conferred upon\nthem by the Charter of the United Nations in the sphere of\ninternational cooperation.\nWe welcome the steps that have already been taken to\nachieve the objectives we have set, but we believe that we\nneed to arrive at a more effective and more economical\nUnited Nations system, one which is at the same time less\npassive in executing the programmes adopted here.\nThe emergence of new conflicts and the persistence of\nold ones in different parts of the world reconfirm, if such a\nthing is necessary, the proven wisdom of trying to achieve,\nas we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations, an integral structure of harmonization and peaceful\ncooperation for the international community. Let us pledge\nto achieve this with our votes and our actions.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is my pleasure\nto extend to you, Sir, my sincere felicitations on your\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. In discharging your important duties,\nyou can count on the support and cooperation of my\ndelegation. Your wide experience and diplomatic skills are\na valuable asset for the success of this important session of\nthe General Assembly.\n\nThis is the first time that my country, the Republic of\nMacedonia, is attending a session of the General Assembly\nas an independent State committed to making its full\ncontribution to the enhancement of world peace and the\npromotion of international cooperation.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is a country with foreign\npolicies based on the principles of peace, friendship and\ncooperation. We see the interdependence of interests and\nmutual respect as the future of successful international\ncooperation. An important element of our foreign policy is\nto promote good-neighbourly relations and to incorporate the\nprinciples of the new European architecture in the\ncrisis-ridden region of the Balkans. Such a foreign policy is\nconsistent with the internal development of the Republic of\nMacedonia, which is oriented towards a market economy,\ndemocracy, a State of law, human rights and harmony in\ninter-ethnic relations.\nBy attaining its independence in a peaceful and\nlegitimate manner, the Republic of Macedonia has kept the\npeace and forestalled a spill-over of the war into the\nsouthern Balkans. The comprehensive efforts of the past\ntwo years have changed our historic position from a bone of\ncontention to a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans.\nPursuant to this, the endeavours of the delegation of the\nRepublic of Macedonia in the course of this session will be\naimed at strict compliance with the United Nations Charter;\nsupport for all measures that enhance international peace and\nsecurity; the democratization of international relations in all\nspheres; the advancement of human rights and freedoms to\nthe utmost degree; the promotion and development of a\npolicy of good-neighbourly relations; forestalling the\nproliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction; and\nthe enhancement of preventive diplomacy in settling\ndisputes.\nThe adverse situation of the world today is a source of\nconcern to all of us. We are not fully satisfied with the\nefforts of our Organization nor especially with the results it\nhas achieved in resolving current sources of tension. We\naccept the assertion that the world today is not threatened by\na new world war and that the use of nuclear arms is not very\nlikely. But the fact remains that the number of serious and\npotential military conflicts is increasing. The efforts of our\nOrganization to find peaceful solutions have been enormous.\nRegrettably, the results have not always been productive,\nowing to a certain extent to the absence of a wider\nimplementation of preventive diplomatic measures and\nactivities.\nI take this opportunity to emphasize the extraordinary\nsignificance of the historical accord between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization for peace in the Middle\nEast and the development of world relations. All those who\nhave contributed to its signing deserve our special\nrecognition.\nIn this context, I am deeply convinced that, despite all\ndifficulties, we will soon be speaking of South Africa as a\nregion of successful development and human dignity. Let us\nhope that the forces of peace in that region will ultimately\nprevail over the forces of regression and apartheid.\nI must reiterate our deep concern over the perpetuation\nof the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the threat of a\nspill-over and a wider destabilization of our region. In dead\nearnest we, a country situated in the immediate vicinity, see\nthis as the threat of an all-out Balkan war. The situation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina is extremely grave, tragic and\nincomprehensible. The most terrible post-cold-war drama is\nunfolding in the heart of Europe: massive killings, massive\ndestruction, over 2 million refugees, insane acts of ethnic\ncleansing and genocide. Numerous international conferences\nand activities have been undertaken in order to bring an end\nto this war. The Security Council has adopted numerous\nresolutions. Let us all hope that peace in Bosnia will finally\nbecome a reality.\nAn end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a first\nand essential step. However, permanent peace in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina will not be possible without compliance with,\nand upholding of, the fundamental principles of international\nlaw, the United Nations Charter and the principles of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\nnamely that borders cannot be changed by force; that the\ninternational community does not recognize or accept \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\"; and that the rights of minorities must be\nrespected.\nWithout these preconditions, not only will permanent\npeace in Bosnia and Herzegovina be impossible, but a\nprecedent will be set which will incite new conflicts. To\ncondone the use of force and military superiority for\nterritorial expansion and redrawn borders would exacerbate\nother, less heated, tensions, especially in the ethnically\nmixed Balkans and the countries of Eastern Europe. It\nwould in fact mean condoning the potential for permanent\ninter-ethnic wars.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3\nThe Republic of Macedonia is vitally interested in\nseeing an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nforestalling a spill-over and attaining peace on lasting\nfoundations. For these reasons, and out of concern for our\nown security and for peace and stability in the region, we\nhave undertaken a number of timely preventive measures in\ncooperation with the United Nations. In this context, I\nwould like to stress the key role played by Security Council\nresolution 795 (1992) of December 1992 for the deployment\nof a contingent from the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) in the Republic of Macedonia.\nThe decision of the Security Council, to which the\nSecretary- General made a great contribution, has proved to\nbe justified, timely and efficient. It has demonstrated the\nenormous advantages of preventive diplomacy. The\npeace-keeping forces of the United Nations, strengthened by\nthe United States contingent, are of great importance for our\nsecurity and for sustaining peace and stability in the region.\nOur cooperation with these forces is exemplary, and it will\nremain so in the future. This step has greatly increased the\nfeelings of security and trust in the peace-keeping activities\nof the United Nations on the part of the citizens of the\nRepublic of Macedonia.\nAs a country and as a people, our permanent interest\nlies in peace and cooperation in the Balkans. In the same\nspirit, our efforts are aimed at establishing good- neighbourly\nrelations with all our neighbours and at resolving all existing\nproblems with our southern neighbour. The war in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, the implementation of United Nations\nsanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, and the remains of\nbloc divisions prevalent until recently prevent the Balkans\nfrom functioning on natural regional principles. Economic\nand cultural ties, communications, the free flow of people,\ngoods and ideas have practically been severed. This is\nindeed a depressing situation. In order to prepare for the\ntwenty-first century and a Europe of open borders and\ncooperation, it is essential that the Balkans undergo major\nchanges. This is in the interest of all the peoples and all the\ncountries in this region. Those are the reasons why\nMacedonia has adopted policies of good-neighbourly\nrelations, peaceful settlement of problems and development\nof overall economic, political and cultural cooperation\namong the countries of the Balkans. We are truly convinced\nthat, in the interest of peace and stability, the international\ncommunity will ardently support these processes in the\nBalkans. The principles of the Conference on Security and\nCo-operation in Europe and the processes within the\nEuropean Community are the only options for peace,\nstability and economic revival in the Balkans. However, this\nalso implies that all the Balkan States, which have chosen\nthe European option, must be enabled to achieve gradual\nintegration into the European Community.\nWe are all dissatisfied with the stagnation of the world\neconomy in the past year, the deterioration of the economic\nsituation in the world, and the economic situation in certain\ncountries and regions. The number of people affected by\nunemployment, poverty and hunger is on the rise. For\ndeveloped countries, recovery from the recession has been\nslower than expected, hindering their increased participation\nin the development of the developing countries and countries\nin transition.\nBecause of this situation, and because of our firm\nconviction that the period after the cold war must not grow\ninto a period of economic conflicts, we believe that much\nmore can be done to seek a way out of the world\u2019s current\neconomic and social difficulties. In this context, I am\nconvinced that the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly will serve as firm encouragement for an increase\nin world demand and for liberalization of world trade. A\nvery important prerequisite for the realization of this goal is\nthe successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations,\nencouraged by the Tokyo summit. It is also essential to\nresolve the issue of arrears and that of access by developing\ncountries and countries in transition to international financial\nmarkets. All of these activities support the view that only\ndevelopment generates new development, while stagnation\nbrings only regression and poverty.\nEnhanced protection of human rights is justifiably\nreceiving greater priority in the work of our Organization.\nWe are concerned by the fact that in the past year, violations\nof human rights have reached epidemic proportions. We feel\nthat the Vienna Conference on Human Rights is a very\npositive step in the right direction, and we hope that the\nDeclaration and Action Programme adopted at that\nConference will contribute greatly to ending the\nunfavourable developments in this area today.\nThe negotiations in Vienna have clearly shown that\ncurrent mechanisms for implementing existing human-rights\ninstruments are not efficient, and that much improvement is\nneeded, particularly in the rights of ethnic, religious and\nlinguistic minorities. A significant step in this direction has\nbeen taken by the adoption last year of the Declaration on\nminorities. The next steps which our delegation will support\nare the commencement of operations of the Commission on\nHuman Rights according to the Declaration on the Rights of\nPersons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and\nLinguistic Minorities, and an examination of the need for\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsetting up a United Nations high commission for minorities,\nwith headquarters in Geneva.\nI would like to point out that all unresolved issues\ninvolving ethnic minorities can well lead to future military\nconflicts, particularly in certain regions of the world, thus\nendangering international peace. Hence it is essential to take\nimmediate preventive measures in this area as well.\nThe Republic of Macedonia is a European country in\ntransition, a landlocked country, a country of transit and a\ndeveloping country. These factors contribute to the\neconomic difficulties of my country. The situation is further\ncomplicated by the consequences of the United Nations\nsanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. I would\nimmediately like to emphasize that we have strictly complied\nwith the implementation of the sanctions. As a result, this\nyear alone, our gross national product has been cut in half.\nExternal trade has been reduced considerably, transport costs\nhave increased immensely, and other indirect damage has\noccurred as well.\nToday, the survival, democracy and economic\ndevelopment of the Republic of Macedonia are\nfundamentally dependent on assistance from the international\ncommunity. Otherwise, it is very possible that social\ntensions, and the probable collapse of the economy, will\nbring about a new crisis spot. I am deeply convinced that,\nin accordance with Article 50 of the Charter and Security\nCouncil resolution 820 (1993), the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council will be in a position to provide us with\nconcrete forms of assistance.\nIt is inconceivable to expect a small country to bear the\ndamage of an international action of this type on its own,\nwithout solidarity and timely assistance. Aid should be\nprovided now as a preventive measure, instead of after the\noutbreak of those likely social clashes which may grow into\nnew conflicts.\nIn this spirit, the delegation of the Republic of\nMacedonia at this session will lay out our direct proposals\nregarding the problem of compensation for damage incurred\nas a result of implementing the sanctions, the problems\nderiving from the position of landlocked countries, and other\nissues related to peace and cooperation.\nThe strengthening of the United Nations in all aspects,\nin the post-cold-war period, is of vital importance to the\nRepublic of Macedonia. My country belongs to a group of\ncountries that can survive and develop only in conditions\nwithout war, in a world where peace and stability are not\nthreatened, where international cooperation will be conducted\nwithout obstacles and discrimination, and a world where\neveryone will have respect for human dignity.\nIn this context, the delegation of the Republic of\nMacedonia will make its full contribution to the successful\nwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nand to strengthening the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Since PLO Chairman Yasser\nArafat shook hands with the Israeli Prime Minister on the\nWhite House lawn, nothing seems impossible any more.\nThe end of the cold war has opened opportunities to set\naside some of the most intractable, destructive and polarizing\nconflicts of our time.\nApartheid is coming to an end in South Africa. Eastern\nEurope is free. Russia and the other States of the former\nSoviet Union are shaking off the stifling effects of more than\n70 years of communism. Germany has been peacefully\nreunited.\nIn Asia, Cambodia is moving towards national\nreconciliation after almost 20 years of war. Viet Nam and\nLaos are reintegrating themselves into the South-East Asian\ncommunity.\nChina and Taiwan held direct informal talks in\nSingapore and Beijing this year. They will continue their\nown dialogue at their own pace. They should be encouraged\nto build confidence by working together, as they already\nhave in the Asian Development Bank and the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC) and as they hope to\ndo in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\nChange has its own dynamic. And not all changes are\nbenign. The post-cold-war problems are legion and well\nknown. It will be a challenge for the United Nations to\nrespond. In recent years, there has been a marked expansion\nin the number and scope of the operations and activities\nauthorized by the Security Council.\nEstablished procedures, such as the Security Council-\nmandated Commission that has demarcated the boundary\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait, have made and will continue to\nmake positive contributions to stabilizing the post-cold-war\nworld, providing authoritative reference points. United\nNations specialized agencies, such as the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are playing an important\nrole in holding renegade countries like North Korea to\ninternationally accepted standards of conduct in the critical\narea of nuclear non-proliferation. The international\ncommunity must continue to support such tried and tested\nmeasures and organizations.\nBut there is also an expectation that the end of the cold\nwar will enable the Security Council to play more ambitious\nroles and at last assume \\\"primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security\\\" under\nChapters V and VII of the Charter. In Cambodia, Haiti and\nSomalia, among other places, the United Nations is breaking\nnew ground by actively interposing itself as a vital\nstabilizing actor in situations which would once have been\nconsidered essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of\nStates.\nThe legal, diplomatic and political implications of these\ndevelopments are still unfolding and are not yet fully\nunderstood. Not everyone is entirely comfortable with them.\nBut I believe that most Member States regard the trend as\ngenerally positive and as making for a more secure world.\nThe majority wants a more active and effective Security\nCouncil.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report on the question of\nequitable representation on and increase in the membership\nof the Security Council, submitted in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 47/62, has thus occasioned\ngreat interest. There is wide consensus that if it is to be\neffective in the next century the Security Council cannot\nsimply extrapolate its mandate from the starting-point of\n1945 after the cold-war interregnum, but must accurately\nreflect the current configuration of global power.\nInternational order cannot be built on nostalgia. Too great\na disjuncture from reality will doom the Security Council to\neventual irrelevance. As membership of the United Nations\nexpands, there is also a general expectation that the Security\nCouncil should become more representative of the\nOrganization as a whole.\nThe composition of the Security Council is a\ncompromise between the principle of the sovereign equality\nof States and the realities of power politics. That all States\nare equal but that some, for better or for worse, have a\ndisproportionate influence on the international order is a fact\nof life. Great-Power leadership is vital. It is a reality.\nRecognition of the special status of great Powers is thus a\nrequisite for effective action by the Security Council. When\nit comes to the crunch, only the great Powers can make a\ndecisive difference. But the temper of our times also\ndemands that if action is to command a general consensus:\nthe great must seek the mandate of the many.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 17\nThe issue is, however, more easily defined than\nresolved. The only previous increase in the size of the\nSecurity Council began in the 1956 session of the General\nAssembly with discussions on an increase of non-permanent\nseats. Agreement was reached only in 1963 and came into\nforce two years later, almost a decade after the process had\nbegun. The lapse of time shows the complexities involved.\nThe difficulties are still with us. To be sure, there are\nestablished principles laid down in Article 23 (1) of the\nCharter to guide the way to a possible further expansion of\nnon-permanent seats. But there are no such guidelines for\nthe more crucial question of an increase in permanent\nmembers. The Secretary-General\u2019s report must therefore be\nrealistically considered as only the beginning of a long\nprocess of debate whose outcome cannot be confidently\npredicted at this point.\nThere are two basic problems. The first is simply to\ndecide what is the current configuration of international\npower that should be reflected in the distribution of\npermanent seats. This is not as straightforward as it may\nseem. When the Charter was being drafted, the end of the\nSecond World War, with easily discernible winners and\nlosers, was in sight and was being prepared for. The\nintention was for the winners to have primary responsibility\nfor guiding the new international order. Yet even then, two\nof the \\\"Big Three\\\" victors, the Soviet Union and the United\nKingdom, were sceptical of Roosevelt\u2019s view of China\u2019s\nability to play a major role in the post-war world.\nChurchill\u2019s insistence on including France among the elite\ngroup was met with similar scepticism by Roosevelt and\nStalin.\nIt will be even more difficult to decide who belongs to\nthe new elite. The end of the cold war took everyone by\nsurprise and was far from clear-cut in its resolution.\nEconomic, political and military power no longer necessarily\ncohere in one single locus. The United States is victor, but\nits economic recovery is slow and its competitiveness\nblunted. Russia is in serious economic and political\ndifficulties but, because it has nuclear weapons, it remains\na military great Power exercising a commanding influence\non its former dominions, where the threat of chaos in the\npost-cold-war world is also greatest. Japan and Germany are\nclearly world economic powerhouses, but both lack an\ninternal and regional consensus on the use of military forces\nbeyond their borders.\nThe second problem is even more fundamental and\nvexing. The United Nations is an international Organization.\nIt is not and was never intended to be a supranational\norganization. The United Nations was created by sovereign\nStates and can do nothing without their assent, in which\nprocess the permanent members have a more than\nproportionate say through their veto. I state this without\nrancour as a fact well known to all. Any design for\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council therefore\ncannot just be based on abstract wisdom concerning the\nrequisites of the international order. No plan that has any\nprospect of succeeding can avoid reckoning with calculations\nof the national advantage of the current permanent members.\nBut if the new Security Council is really to reflect the\ncurrent international distribution of power, the process\nshould logically entail the deposition of some from the elite\nas well as the anointment of others. Even if some were to\nbe elevated without necessarily displacing others, the\nexpansion of the small group of the select would imply the\nrelative diminution of the status of the current permanent\nmembers. It is not surprising, therefore, that only one\npermanent member has so far come out unambiguously in\nfavour of an expansion in the number of permanent seats.\nIt does not take a cynic to wonder whether it was\nemboldened to do so because the others have been so\nconspicuously coy on this critical point. No country has\never voluntarily relinquished privilege and power. We are\nafter all in the company of sovereign States, not saints.\nThere is no circumventing the veto. There is no\nconstitutional means of amending the Charter without the\nassent of all the permanent members, some of whom may\nbelieve they stand to lose by it. Yet change is imperative if\nwe are not to squander the opportunity afforded by the end\nof the cold war - more so for small States that have few\nbetter choices than an effective United Nations for their\nsecurity.\nTo make progress, there is no alternative but gradually\nto shape a consensus through a patient process of debate and\ndiscussion. To force the pace or attempt to impose a\nmajority agreement will not work. At this preliminary stage,\nit would be most useful to try to identify and build\nconsensus on objective general criteria that all permanent\nmembers, present or aspiring, must fulfil. This is a more\nclinical and constructive approach than engaging in a horse\nrace or a beauty contest to pick specific countries. To\nattempt to do so at this stage is premature and would only\nbe divisive. But the identification of objective criteria will\nset a common standard and, if we can agree on them, a\nconsensus on specific countries will naturally emerge.\nThis will entail thinking through the role of the United\nNations into the next century. What challenges will the\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nUnited Nations face in the next decade? What will be the\nrole and priorities of a new Security Council under these\nconditions? What capabilities will it need? These difficult\nquestions demand the most exhaustive possible examination.\nThe General Assembly should consider the formation of a\nworking group, representative of the whole membership, to\nconsider them and formulate agreed objective criteria for the\nexpansion of the Security Council, especially its permanent\nmembership.\nTo stimulate discussion, Singapore suggests the\nfollowing:\nFirst, there should be a level playing field with regard\nto all present and future members of a possible expanded\nSecurity Council. Anachronistic references to \\\"enemy\nStates\\\" in Articles 53, 77 and 107 of the Charter should be\nremoved. It is time to set aside the baggage of the past.\nSuggestions that there could be or should be a different set\nof permanent members without the veto are also impractical.\nNo country that is capable of making a contribution as a\nnew permanent member will accept such second-class status\nfor long. It will only undermine the principle of great-Power\ncooperation, in the absence of which the Security Council\ncannot function. Nor is it practical or even desirable to do\naway with the veto. The fact that the veto has been abused\ndoes not detract from its intended function. It is a\nrecognition of the hard reality that great Powers will not\nconsent to put their power at the disposal of a sheer majority\nfor the implementation of decisions which they do not agree\nwith. It is a safety valve that prevents the United Nations\nfrom undertaking commitments that it lacks the power to\nfulfil. However, to minimize the misuse of the veto, if\npermanent membership is expanded at least two vetoes\nshould be required to block a resolution.\nSecondly, privilege must be paid for. An expanded role\nfor the Security Council will require more resources. A\nUnited Nations perennially on the brink of financial\ninsolvency cannot effectively meet the challenges of the next\ncentury. A permanent member should therefore carry a\nlarger portion of the financial burden of the United Nations.\nEach permanent member should pay at least 9 per cent of\nthe operating expenses of the United Nations as well as\n11 per cent of the costs of the peace-keeping operations of\nthe United Nations, which are the average percentages of the\npermanent five\u2019s current collective percentage of these\nbudgets.\nThirdly, permanent members must have muscle and the\nwill and the capability to wield it for the cause of the United\nNations. The main mission and primary responsibility of the\nSecurity Council is to maintain international peace and\nstability. Force will be needed in pursuit of order and the\nSecurity Council cannot be effective without a sword that is\nsharp and ready. All permanent members should be\nprepared to give effect to Article 43 of the Charter and be\nready to place their military forces at the disposal of the\nUnited Nations and shed blood to uphold international order\nif necessary.\nThis list is by no means exhaustive. Other members\nwill have their own suggestions for appropriate criteria. I\nurge all members to participate in discussions on the\nexpansion of the Security Council so that we may have the\nbenefit of the fullest possible range of views and emerge\nwith the widest possible consensus.\nFinally, Mr. President, I should like to congratulate you\non your unanimous election. I am confident that you will\nlead the Assembly at this session effectively. I should also\nlike to take this opportunity to welcome the six new\nMembers that have joined the Organization. I am certain\nthat they will contribute positively to the work of the United\nNations.\n"

I also wish to acknowledge the excellent work done\nby His Excellency Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria as\nPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.\nI also pay tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the cause\nof the United Nations and to its reform at this important\njuncture.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express my\nwarmest welcome to the new Member States - Andorra, the\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Monaco and the Slovak Republic. My\ndelegation wishes them every success and looks forward to\nworking closely with them in all areas.\nWe live in an age of historic transition. This is\nconfirmed by the dramatic changes in the international\nsituation since the last session. A new world order, which\nis fundamentally different from the old one, is taking shape.\nWe are witnessing a trend towards peace, cooperation and\ninterdependence, instead of conflict, confrontation and\nideological bigotry. The most resounding testimony to this\neffect emerged in the peace accord between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization signed in Washington this\nmonth.\nToday we find ourselves in an international\nenvironment that was only a vision to the founding fathers\nof the United Nations. I should like to quote from the\nremarks of Mr. Oswaldo Aranha, a distinguished diplomat\nfrom Brazil, who was the President of the General Assembly\nin 1947. He said:\n\\\"All idea of force is today obsolete and negative. The\nold order, based on political power, is trying to survive,\nbut there is no longer room for predominance through\nforce. The United Nations stands for the new order,\nbased on peaceful accord, on understanding, on free\ndiscussion ... and on the common and equal\nresponsibility of peoples.\\\" (Official Records of the\nGeneral Assembly, Second Session, Plenary Meeting,\\\"\n128th meeting, p. 1442)\nForty-five years after these words were spoken, we\nfinally stand at the end of one era and on the threshold of a\nnew one. This may be a second, and perhaps the last,\nopportunity for us to fulfil the stated mission of the United\nNations at its creation.\nTo be sure, the end of the cold war does not mean the\nend of all problems. The world worries about the continuing\nand even worsening ethnic and religious conflicts. We face\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Environmental protection is another major\nchallenge to today\u2019s world. Development cannot be taken\nfor granted. These are monumental issues that require the\ncollective efforts of all members of the international\ncommunity, and of the United Nations in particular.\nWe have entered an age of diversity and uncertainty,\nbut we should not be daunted by this new reality. We may\nnot be accustomed to it, but we should not be afraid of\nliving in a pluralistic world. Nations differ in what they\nwant to achieve and in how they want to achieve it. These\ndiverse goals, while constituting a possible source of\nconflict, should also form the basis for complementarity and\ncooperation among nations.\nSome say that bipolarity is being replaced by\nmultipolarity. Yet \\\"pluralistic\\\", rather than \\\"multipolar\\\", is\nperhaps more precise a term to describe the emerging world\norder. A multipolar world would postulate geopolitics based\nupon conflict and balance of power. A pluralistic world, on\nthe other hand, accepts diversity and encourages cooperation.\nThus, the world has the potential to become more democratic\nand harmonious than it has ever been in history.\nOne of the most noteworthy changes in the aftermath\nof the cold war is the strengthening of the United Nations,\nparticularly in the field of peace and security. The \\\"Agenda\nfor Peace\\\" report that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali\nsubmitted last year provides a solid base on which to\naugment the role of the United Nations in this area.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 35\nPreventive diplomacy, in particular, is of the utmost\nimportance, given the enormous human and material costs of\nconflicts once they break out. My delegation will continue\nits participation in the efforts to translate into a meaningful\nreality such initiatives as \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\" and\n\\\"post-conflict peace-building\\\".\nAs the continuing tragedies in Bosnia and Somalia\ndemonstrate, conflicts fuelled by ethnic and religious\ndifferences, poverty and internal disorder are becoming a\nnew and major threat to international security. In response\nto increasing demands, 17 United Nations peace-keeping\noperations are active in different parts of the world.\nHowever, traditional peace-keeping may no longer be\na sufficient response to current conflicts. We find that the\nscope of these operations is widening, ranging from the\nsupervision of a cease-fire to nation-building. Furthermore,\nthe timely deployment of peace-keepers is imperative to\ntemper a conflict at an early stage.\nFor this reason, we believe that the proposed\nmechanism of United Nations stand-by forces is an\nappropriate way to enhance the Organization\u2019s role in\nmeeting new challenges to peace. The availability of\nstand-by forces will enable the United Nations to provide a\nquick and effective response to conflicts.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm my Government\u2019s\nsupport of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM II). We dispatched an engineering battalion in\nJune, and we urge all the factions concerned in Somalia to\ncooperate fully with the United Nations. Given the\nsuccessful precedent set by the United Nations Transitional\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC), I am confident that\nUNOSOM II will also fulfill its peacekeeping mission.\nNone the less, it is a source of grave concern that the\nnumber of United Nations casualties in Somalia is sharply\nincreasing. Effective arrangements need to be worked out to\nenhance the safety and security of those who are involved in\nthe United Nations peace-keeping operations there and\neverywhere else.\nIn the domain of peace and security, preventing the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, both nuclear\nand biochemical, is another critical task.\nThe Republic of Korea strongly supports the efforts to\nstop nuclear-weapons proliferation beyond 1995 through the\nextension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). We\nalso support the strengthening of International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards as the central device for\nensuring the effectiveness of the NPT.\nAt the same time, consistent with the spirit and\nobjective of the NPT, we urge the existing nuclear Powers\nnot only to accelerate their efforts to reduce their nuclear\narsenal but also actively to join the efforts for a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. That will encourage\nnon-nuclear countries to adhere and agree to an indefinite\nextension of the NPT r\u00e9gime. My delegation welcomes the\ncommitment of nuclear-weapon States to a continuing\nmoratorium on nuclear testing.\nWith regard to chemical and biological weapons, the\nconclusion of the chemical weapons Convention in January\nwas a big step forward. We urge those States that have not\nyet joined the Convention to do so as early as possible. The\nConvention, together with the biological weapons\nConvention, will serve as a major instrument in preventing\nproliferation of biochemical weapons.\nWith the ending of the cold war, disarmament has\nmoved into the realm of real possibility. Over the past few\nyears disarmament has gained momentum with agreements\non nuclear-arms reduction and cut-backs in conventional\nforces. We have to keep this momentum alive. In the light\nof these developments, the October 1992 report of the\nSecretary-General on \\\"New dimensions of arms regulation\nand disarmament in the post-cold war era\\\" has offered timely\nand useful guidelines for disarmament.\nAt the same time, we should take note of the ongoing\nreassessment of multilateral disarmament machinery. The\nConference on Disarmament is particularly important as the\nsingle multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. In my\ndelegation\u2019s view, the Conference on Disarmament should be\nappropriately expanded in membership to reflect the changed\ninternational environment.\nIn addition, the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms that was launched with the participation\nof more than 70 Member States should be implemented on\na universal basis as soon as possible.\nAs I discuss the issue of disarmament, I need to draw\nattention to the Korean peninsula. Despite the worldwide\ntrends towards peace and cooperation, there is still tension\nin Korea.\nMy Government believes that the solution to the inter-\nKorean question should be sought in the context of the post--\ncold-war international order of reconciliation and\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncooperation. This means active participation by both North\nand South Korea in the regional and global order.\nWe are particularly concerned with the North Korean\nnuclear programme. North Korea should cooperate in\nremoving any suspicions surrounding it by honouring its\nnon-proliferation obligations under the NPT.\nIn conformity with the Security Council resolution\n825 (1993), the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea must\ncomply with its safeguards agreement with IAEA. At the\nsame time, we urge the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea to cooperate with us in implementing the 1991\ninter-Korean Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the\nKorean Peninsula.\nMy delegation is also deeply concerned about the safety\nof North Korean nuclear power reactors. The International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the countries concerned\nshould pay special attention to the safety issue as well as to\nthe non-proliferation question in relation to the North Korean\nnuclear program.\nThere are several urgent issues of a non-military nature\nwhose solution requires a global approach. Development\nand trade, environment, and human rights are some of them.\nThe post-cold war international environment both\nrequires and enables us to place greater emphasis on\neconomic and social development. We should now devote\nthe peace dividend to development efforts. Given the high\ndegree of interdependence in today\u2019s world, no country is\nimmune from the consequences of economic difficulties in\nother countries. Poverty, population problems and\nenvironmental degradation have become a common threat to\nthe well-being of mankind. These non-military crises are\nnow the issues to be addressed with a sense of urgency and\ncollective endeavour by all nations.\nThe role of the United Nations in this area should be\nstrengthened. I welcome the recent initiatives to restructure\nand revitalize the United Nations system in the economic\nand social field. The structure of the system should be\nstreamlined for effective mobilization of limited resources.\nMeanwhile, I believe a substantial increase in development\nresources is necessary to support developmental cooperation.\nDeveloped countries are encouraged to enhance their efforts\nin this area.\nTo achieve a more prosperous world, we need to\nstrengthen the global free trade regime. The regime of the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) was created\nshortly after the founding of the United Nations. The\nunderlying philosophy was clear: peace and security can\nbest be guaranteed if buttressed by economic prosperity.\nDuring the cold-war period, this global free trade regime\nexceeded early expectations by bringing wealth and\nprosperity to those who embraced it. Now that the cold war\nis over, the whole world can more fully benefit from it.\nOur choice is clear. We must strengthen the free trade\nsystem, by ensuring a successful conclusion of the Uruguay\nRound.\nEconomic development is closely linked with the\nenvironment issue. It was at the Rio Summit last year that\nthe world was keenly awakened to this critical issue. The\nSummit emphatically stressed the importance of global\npartnership to achieve environmentally sound and sustainable\ndevelopment towards the twenty-first century.\nWhen we deal with environmental problems, it is\nimportant to strike a balance between the North and the\nSouth. The former focuses on the primacy of environmental\nprotection while the latter emphasizes the development\nimperatives. We believe that the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment is a very appropriate forum for seeking such\na balance and coordinating the implementation of the results\nof the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment.\nAs a member of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the Republic of Korea is ready to do its part\nin contributing to global action. We hope to help bridge the\ndivergences between the developed and the developing\ncountries. We are now in the process of joining the\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and other\nenvironmental agreements.\nThe human rights issue is receiving growing attention\non the international level. This may be a natural\nphenomenon as the emerging pluralistic world society\nfacilitates the promotion of democracy all over the world.\nAt the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna\nin June, I had the privilege to report to the forum that human\nrights have finally come of age in Korea. I also pledged our\nfirm support for the international movements to promote\nhuman rights.\nThe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action are\nthe most significant results of the Conference. We must take\nthe necessary follow-up measures. In five years we will\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights of 1948. I hope that our\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 37\ngeneration will be able to meet the expectation set by those\nwho produced this Declaration.\nAs we pay due attention to the human rights issue, we\nshould also concern ourselves with the question of refugees\nand disadvantaged groups. Armed conflicts and natural\ndisasters around the world raise the need for humanitarian\nassistance and protection of refugees and displaced persons.\nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s recent accession to the Convention\nrelating to the status of refugees testifies to its commitment\nto this cause.\nI attach special significance to the World Summit for\nSocial Development which will take place in 1995 in\nCopenhagen. I hope that effective programmes of action\nwill be put forward at this Conference to tackle major\nimpediments to social development.\nAs the United Nations faces new opportunities and\nchallenges, it also needs reforms in order to cope with them\nbetter. This is indeed a tall order.\nWe believe that, with the enormous increase in the\ngeneral membership of the United Nations, it has become\nnecessary to enlarge the Security Council. The question is\nhow to enlarge the Council without sacrificing its\neffectiveness. The creation of a third category, with long-\nterm membership but without the power of veto, coupled\nwith the expansion of the non-permanent membership, may\nbe an answer.\nConcerning the General Assembly, the simplification of\nthe committee structure, through the merger of the Fourth\nCommittee and the Special Political Committee, will\nundoubtedly enhance its efficiency. The rationalization of\nthe agenda may be another measure to help enhance the\ncapability of the General Assembly.\nMy delegation also welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s\nmeasures to reform the Secretariat and supports him in this\ncomplex task. In particular, the recent establishment of the\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary-General for Inspections and\nInvestigations is an initial step towards increasing the\naccountability of the Secretariat.\nI note with concern the report of the Secretary-General\nthat refers to the financial status of the United Nations. We\nfully agree with him that in order to enable this Organization\nto meet the demands of its time, the resources provided\nshould match its political will. My delegation is in favor of\nconstructive discussions during the current session which\nwould explore ways and means of alleviating the current\nfinancial difficulties of the United Nations.\nI believe the reform should be based on a proper\nunderstanding of the changed world situation. It should also\nconform with the purposes and principles of the United\nNations. I hope this process will lead to an efficient and\nproductive United Nations that is truly capable of fulfilling\nthe aspirations of mankind by the year 1995, the world\nbody\u2019s fiftieth anniversary.\nGiven the vital role that the United Nations has played\nin the Republic of Korea, we will observe this occasion with\nparticular dedication. A national committee will be formed\nand activities will be coordinated with the Secretariat, with\nspecial emphasis on conveying the message of the United\nNations to Korea\u2019s next generation.\nIn the Republic of Korea, the new Government has\nlaunched a reorientation of foreign policy. Our new\ndiplomacy places emphasis on universal values - peace,\ndemocracy, liberty, welfare and human rights. Globalism is\nat the core of the new diplomacy.\nKorea is pursuing a more active role in tackling global\nissues such as international peace and security, disarmament,\nthe eradication of poverty, protection of the environment and\nefficient utilization of natural resources. It is through such\nengagement in global affairs that Korea seeks to play its due\npart in the activities of the United Nations designed to make\nthe world a safer, more just and more prosperous place.\nThe Republic of Korea is now participating in the\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II). It is\nalso serving a three-year term on the Economic and Social\nCouncil. We shall actively seek ways to increase our\ncontribution to international organizations, especially those\nwithin the framework of the United Nations.\nIn this regard, the Republic of Korea hopes to better\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity by having an opportunity to serve on the Security\nCouncil. We hope to receive the encouragement and support\nof the world community in these efforts.\nDemocratization, and harmony between nations, are the\nmost important trends of the new world order. By drawing\nupon them, we have the opportunity to make the future more\npeaceful and secure than ever before in the history of\nmankind. Our success or failure will depend upon our\nunderstanding of the nature of the new order and our ability\nto build on it.\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nTo be sure, there are dangers also. We failed with the\nLeague of Nations. We often experienced bitter frustration\nduring the cold war period. Yet, we are on the threshold of\na new beginning. We need to look forward, because the\nfuture is in our hands. We have to prove to ourselves that\nwe are equal to the task.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish, on behalf of the\nUganda delegation, to join those representatives who have\nalready congratulated Mr. Insanally of Guyana on his well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His election to\nthis high office is a tribute to his personal qualities and also\nan honour to Guyana, with which Uganda enjoys warm and\nfriendly relations. Given his wide experience, and especially\nhis intimate knowledge of the United Nations, I am\nconfident that he will successfully guide its deliberations\nduring the session. In this effort, he can count on Uganda\u2019s\ncooperation and support.\nI wish also to express the appreciation of my delegation\nto Mr. Insanally\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, who presided with distinction at the forty-seventh\nsession.\nOur appreciation goes, equally, to the distinguished\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has\nprovided dynamic and courageous leadership to our\nOrganization. He has come to grips with one of the biggest\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 29\nchallenges to the international community - conflict\nresolution - and his incisive reports are an inspiration to us\nall.\nIt is with happiness that, on behalf of the people and\nGovernment of Uganda, I express a warm welcome to the\nCzech Republic, Slovakia, Eritrea, the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra as new\nMembers of the United Nations. We look forward to\nworking closely with them in our common efforts to fulfil\nthe objectives and achieve the goals of the Organization.\nAllow me to convey to the people and Government of\nIndia Uganda\u2019s profound sympathy and solidarity following\nthe tragic earthquake that struck that country last week,\ncausing enormous destruction and massive loss of life.\nThe dramatic end of the cold war created a wave of\noptimism. The ideological rivalry and the attendant\nconfrontation between the major Powers yielded to\nunderstanding and cooperation, and the nightmare of the\nnuclear annihilation of the world receded - even if, in our\nminds, it was not totally eliminated. We believe that we are\nwitnessing the dawn of a new era that promises the\nbeginning of a new order based on peace, justice and equity\n- as envisaged in the United Nations Charter - both within\nand between nations. Whether we can succeed in attaining\nthat lofty goal is one of the challenges of our time.\nHowever, the events of the last few years have\ntempered this sense of optimism. We see contradictory\ndevelopments - some positive and others negative. On the\none hand, there are positive developments in disarmament,\nthe resolution of conflicts, and the emergence of democratic\ngovernance in many countries. But, on the other hand, we\nhave witnessed the dangers of ethnic and religious\nintolerance, which have generated centrifugal forces in many\nparts of the world, often with debilitating tolls in human life,\nsuffering and the destruction of property. I wish to caution\nagainst the danger of making purely ethnic and religious\nconsiderations the basis for forging a modern State. The\nchallenge is to find democratic solutions for peaceful and\nequitable coexistence in a heterogeneous society.\nThe divide between North and South, reflecting\naffluence on the one hand and widespread poverty and\ndeprivation on the other, is widening. The same division\nbetween the haves and the have-nots is reflected within\nmany nations. Clearly, the deterioration of economic\nconditions in developing countries, if not adequately\naddressed, can only lead to despair and frustration. In the\nlong run, such developments will pose a danger to\ninternational peace and security. The international\ncommunity should keep at the top of its agenda the urgent\ntask of ensuring that the positive changes ushered in by the\ndemise of the cold war equitably benefit all mankind. It is\nincumbent upon us to encourage and promote the positive\ntrends while endeavouring to eliminate or minimize the\nnegative aspects. Marginalization of developing countries\ncannot be in the interest of a better world. We should\nmuster the will to face the political, economic, ecological\nand social challenges that stand in the way of the\nemancipation of the developing countries.\nAt the last session of the General Assembly the\nSecretary-General showed the way forward in his \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\", when he outlined his views on how the\nUnited Nations should carry out its task of maintaining\ninternational peace and security. He underscored the need\nfor an early warning system for crisis situations and the need\nfor timely preventive action, and he suggested peace-building\nmeasures that need to be taken. Uganda supported, and\ncontinues to support, the Secretary-General\u2019s endeavour in\nthis area.\nIn our view, a critical pillar of conflict resolution, both\nat the international and the regional level, is the political will\nof the parties to the conflict and a commitment on their part\nto translate that will into practical actions. Where that will\nand commitment exist, solutions have been forthcoming,\neven to what were perceived as intractable problems.\nAnother critical element in this regard is the capacity to\nenforce solutions where agreements exist. When a group\u2019s\nmajor consideration is military victory, contrary to the\nagreements reached, this may call for legitimate international\nintervention. I have in mind, for example, a number of\nagreements brokered between the parties by regional\norganizations or the United Nations which have then been\ndeliberately scuttled for no legitimate reason. The situations\nin Yugoslavia, Somalia, Liberia and Angola are vivid\nreminders of the need for such a capacity. It is untenable\nthat the international community should fail to act while\nsenseless loss of life is perpetuated or chaos obtains in a\ncountry, as was the case in Somalia and Liberia. As many\nspeakers have stated, sovereignty should not be used to hold\na population hostage. A capacity to intervene in such\nsituations should be in place. This is the question that we\nshould ponder in the course of our deliberations, with a view\nto establishing parameters for such eventualities.\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn our continent, Africa, the contradictory positive and\nnegative trends have also manifested themselves, both in the\npolitical arena and the economic sphere. In southern Africa,\nwe are on the verge of achieving the goal the international\ncommunity has always sought, namely, dismantling apartheid\nand putting in place a democratic and non-racial Government\nin South Africa. Here we have an example of political will\nand determination, and the capacity to translate that will into\nreality.\nUganda welcomes the progress made in South Africa\nand the decision to establish the Transitional Executive\nCouncil (TEC), the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)\nand the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). These\nare vital steps that should pave the way for free and fair\nelections next April, which should lead to the establishment\nof a transitional Government based on universal adult\nsuffrage. We salute Mr. Nelson Mandela and other leaders\nof the liberation movements and President de Klerk for their\nvision and statesmanship, which have made this progress\npossible.\nWith regard to the call to lift sanctions against South\nAfrica in response to this progress, Uganda\u2019s approach has\nalways been guided by the position of the people of South\nAfrica, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the\nCommonwealth and the United Nations. We are therefore\nsupportive of the statement adopted on 29 September in New\nYork by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa,\nwhich recommends the lifting of all economic sanctions,\nwith the exception of those relating to the arms embargo and\nnuclear matters, as recognition of the progress made thus far.\nWe also agree with the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s call for\nvigilance until the Transitional Executive Council is\nestablished and for the establishment of full diplomatic\nrelations following the installation of an elected interim\nGovernment of national unity.\nAs regards Mozambique, Uganda welcomed the signing\nof a peace accord between the Government of Mozambique\nand RENAMO on 4 October 1992. We had hoped that by\nnow all obstacles to the implementation of the accord would\nhave been settled. Addressing the Assembly on 27\nSeptember, President Chissano, outlined the progress made\nin the revival of the country\u2019s economic and social activity\nas a consequence of a cease-fire being effectively honoured.\nThe deployment of the United Nations Operation in\nMozambique (ONUMOZ) provides an atmosphere conducive\nto implementing the provisions of the General Peace\nAgreement. We commend the Government of Mozambique\nfor the flexibility and statesmanship they have demonstrated.\nWe call on RENAMO to reciprocate equally and to comply\nwith Security Council resolution 863 (1993), so that the\npeople of Mozambique can embark on the important task of\nnational reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace and\nstability.\nUganda deeply regrets the resumption of hostilities in\nAngola, which clearly has negative consequences for the\nwhole region. Remarkable progress had been made,\nculminating in the United Nations-supervised elections last\nyear. Unfortunately, the hopes and aspirations of the people\nwere dashed by the resumption of hostilities which\ninterrupted the electoral process. The only way forward lies\nin national reconciliation and the acceptance of the rules of\ndemocratic governance. Uganda supports Security Council\nresolution 864 (1993), the implementation of which would\npave way for a lasting solution. It is incumbent upon\nUNITA to abide by this resolution.\nIn our own region Uganda welcomes the agreement\nbetween the two parties, the Rwandese Government and the\nRwandese Patriotic Front, on a process of national\nreconciliation and the installation of a broad-based\ntransitional government. Uganda, like other countries in the\nregion, is ready and willing to support the Rwandese people\nin their endeavour to find a lasting settlement of their\nproblems. This would also help foster stability and\ncooperation in our subregion. I wish to pay a tribute to\nPresident Ali Hassan Mwinyi and the Government of the\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, to the Organization of African\nUnity, and to all those who have been helping the parties to\nreach this accord.\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in the\nimplementation of the Rwanda agreements. Both parties to\nthe conflict requested the United Nations to provide a neutral\nforce. We are happy to see that this request has received\npositive consideration by the Security Council. The Council\nhas accepted the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendation for the\nestablishment of a neutral force known as the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). In the\nmeantime, Uganda has agreed to the deployment on the\nRwanda-Uganda border of the United Nations Observer\nMission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) - as part and parcel\nof confidence-building measures - and stands ready to give\nadditional support as and when requested.\nThe conflict in southern Sudan continues to be of great\nconcern to, and a source of anguish for, us in Uganda. The\ncivil war has escalated rather than abated, resulting in loss\nof life, increased refugee flows, and the displacement of the\npopulation to neighbouring countries, Uganda included. We\nurge the parties to the conflict to cooperate in support of\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 31\nregional efforts designed to find a lasting solution. I wish\nalso to appeal to the international community to continue\nproviding humanitarian assistance and to be supportive of\nnegotiations for a peaceful settlement.\nThe situation in Somalia is a vivid example of both\nnatural and man-made disasters. Uganda welcomed the\ndecision of the Security Council in 1992 to provide\nhumanitarian assistance to the Somali people and to restore\norder in Somalia. The United Nations operations helped to\nend massive starvation and brought hope to the people of\nSomalia. Uganda is also supportive of the second United\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), whose\nmandate is to provide an appropriate atmosphere for\ncontinued humanitarian assistance and for reconstruction and\nrehabilitation, and to facilitate an overall political settlement.\nWe were encouraged by the Addis Ababa agreement of\nMarch this year whereby various Somali political forces\nagreed upon a programme of disarmament and reconciliation.\nIt is sad that the situation in Somalia took a dramatic turn\nfor the worse with the killing of members of the United\nNations peace-keeping force. We regret the loss of life and\nattacks on the peace-keeping force. I wish to express our\nsincere condolences to the bereaved families and their\nrespective Governments. It remains our conviction that these\nincidents, reprehensible as they are, should not lead the\nUnited Nations to divert from, let alone abdicate, its\nresponsibilities towards the Somali people. Much has been\nachieved. Normalcy has been restored to much of the\ncountry, although chaos and armed resistance continue in a\nnumber of areas, especially in and around Mogadishu, where\nthey imperil international efforts. We call on Somali\npolitical leaders to cooperate with the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD), the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the United\nNations in efforts aimed at achieving peace and\nreconciliation and setting in motion transitional\narrangements, including the establishment of a broad-based\ngovernment. I wish to take this opportunity to commend\nUnited Nations personnel, the countries which have provided\nmaterial and financial support, and the volunteers who have\nrisked their lives in this worthy cause.\nAs regards the situation in Liberia, Uganda supports the\ninitiative of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) for the settlement of the crisis. We\nwelcomed the Cotonou Agreement signed on 25 July 1993,\nwhich provides for a cease-fire and for the transitional\narrangement leading to elections early next year. The\nECOWAS Miliary Observer Group (ECOMOG) has clearly\nbeen a stabilizing force in Liberia. That is why it has been\nentrusted with the supervision and implementation of the\nCotonou Agreement. We look forward to the full\nimplementation of this accord.\nAll this provides an example of the matching of the\npolitical will of the parties to the conflict to the capacity in\nthe region to implement the agreed settlement.\nEqually, the Security Council decision to make it easier\nfor the United Nations to supplement regional efforts in the\nsearch for agreements and in their implementation is most\nwelcome. Apart from enhancing the regional capacity for\npeace-keeping, the Security Council decision helps to\nengender confidence.\nAt the OAU Summit held in Cairo in July this year,\nAfrican States agreed to set up, within the OAU, a\nmechanism for conflict resolution. The positive\ndevelopments in Liberia and Rwanda, where the OAU and\nthe pertinent leaders in the subregion have effectively\ndischarged this role, are indicative of the potentialities of the\nregional mechanism.\nIn the Middle East, the mutual recognition between the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, together\nwith the agreements signed between them, constitute a\nbreakthrough of historic proportions. This is yet another\nillustration of the dictum that where there is a will, vision\nand statesmanship, a way forward will be found. This\ndevelopment holds the promise for concord and cooperation\nin the Middle East region as a whole. We welcome the\nDeclaration of Principles on Palestinian interim self-rule in\nthe occupied territories. These arrangements, which\nenvisage a five-year transition period, are an important step\ntowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973). We commend Chairman Arafat and Prime\nMinister Rabin for the courage and statesmanship they have\ndisplayed. We encourage all of them to persevere in the\ntask ahead and on the journey they have begun. I wish also\nto express Uganda\u2019s appreciation to Norway, the United\nStates, the Russian Federation, and all those who were\ninstrumental in the reaching of this historic accord.\nThree years have elapsed since the outbreak of the Gulf\ncrisis. We are glad that the sovereignty of Kuwait was\nrestored. It remains our hope that, with positive\ndevelopments elsewhere in the region, it will be possible for\nthe people in the Gulf to be reconciled and to solve the\noutstanding problems so that harmony and cooperation can\nbe re-established. This requires, among other things,\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions relating to the\nGulf War settlement.\nUganda supports the efforts by the Secretary-General to\nensure an overall settlement of the Cyprus problem. Any\nsettlement, while taking into account the legitimate interests\nof the parties, should safeguard the sovereignty, unity and\nterritorial integrity of Cyprus.\nAs regards the Korean peninsula, Uganda supports the\naspiration of the Korean people to peaceful reunification.\nWe encourage them to continue their dialogue towards this\nobjective.\nIn Cambodia we have just witnessed the fruitful\ncompletion of the peace process in accordance with the Paris\nAgreements. Under the auspices of the United Nations\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) the\nCambodian people have been able to exercise their right to\nvote and to decide on their own Government in the general\nelections for a constituent assembly. We are happy to see\nthat a new democratic Constitution, with a constitutional\nmonarchy has been peacefully promulgated. I wish to\nexpress the gratitude of the Uganda delegation to the\nSecretary-General and the UNTAC personnel who, under the\nable leadership of Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, have contributed\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian\nquestion. Our appreciation goes equally to Viet Nam,\nFrance, Australia, China, the United States of America and\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\nwhich, at different stages, contributed to the peace process.\nIt is to us a matter of deep regret that in the former\nYugoslavia, instability, strife and war based on ethnic and\nreligious differences continue unabated. In pursuit of the\nreprehensible notion of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", atrocities are\nbeing committed. In spite of the grave situation, it has not\nbeen possible for the Security Council and the international\ncommunity to act decisively to put an end to the agony and\nsuffering there. The injunctions of the Security Council\ncontinue to be flouted with impunity. We reject and\ncondemn the notion of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\". I wish, however,\nto commend the United Nations Protection Force for the\nefforts it has made under the most difficult of conditions.\nOn disarmament, Uganda is encouraged by the progress\nachieved in the wake of the demise of the cold war. The\nUnited States and the Russian Federation under START II\nhave significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. We were\nencouraged by the decision of the United States to extend\nthe moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994, by the\ndeclaration of Russia not to resume testing even if others\ndid, and by France\u2019s commitment not to be the first to\nresume. In spite of the recent set-backs, we hope that this\nmoratorium will hold. Uganda, however, believes that a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the ultimate\nsolution. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty,\nwe shall continue to participate actively in the preparatory\nprocess leading to the 1995 Review Conference. We support\nthe extension of the Treaty, subject to periodic reviews. We\nshall also seek to remove the imbalances in the present\nTreaty and to secure increased assistance for developing\ncountries in the area of the peaceful application of nuclear\nenergy.\nWe maintain that there exists an intrinsic relationship\nbetween the disarmament process and development.\nDeveloping countries paid a heavy price during the height of\nthe cold war as world attention was focused on acquiring\nadditional armaments under the doctrines of deterrence.\nMany of them were trapped in civil conflict arising from\nideological wars. As the resources devoted to building\narmaments are released in the disarmament process, these\nshould be applied for development both within and between\nnations. Unfortunately, at the international level, we have\nyet to see the peace dividend being channelled towards\nassistance to developing countries.\nAt the national level, Uganda, after the restoration of\npeace in the country, has now embarked on a process of\nscaling down its army to a level which the economy can\nsustain and which at the same time meets our legitimate\ndefence needs. This is a bold decision by the Government,\nwhich, in the long run, should release resources for\ndevelopment purposes. I wish here to express our\nappreciation to those countries and organizations which have\nagreed to assist us in the resettlement and integration of\ndemobilized soldiers within the civilian community.\nThis session is taking place in the aftermath of the\nmomentous World Conference on Human Rights that took\nplace in Vienna. That Conference reaffirmed the\ncommitment of the international community to try to secure\nthe full and universal enjoyment of human rights. We hope\nthat as a result there will be increased awareness in the\nworld of the importance of human rights and a determination\nto build the requisite capacity at the national and local levels\nto ensure their enforcement.\nLinked with the human rights issue is the question of\ndemocratic governance and the rule of law. Democratic\ngovernance promotes human rights. In Uganda, as part of\nthe restoration of democratic civilian rule, the Constitutional\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 33\nCommission has already produced a draft constitution. The\nelection of a Constituent Assembly, which is to deliberate\nand agree on the Constitution, will be held in December this\nyear or early next year.\nWhether in Africa or anywhere else, the\ndemocratization process may be difficult, but it is an\nessential ingredient for peace, stability, the rule of law, and\nthe full respect and enjoyment of human rights. This is\nparticularly urgent in developing countries, in Africa in\nparticular. They are essential aspects and conditions of the\ndevelopment process. We must therefore bring our full\nenergies to bear so that the democratization process may\ngain momentum.\nOne of the major objectives of the United Nations,\nenshrined in the Charter, is the promotion of economic and\nsocial progress. In our quest for peace, it is imperative to\naddress the economic and social challenges, which, too\noften, are the fundamental causes of conflicts in many\nregions.\nThe present world economic situation is very grim.\nThere has been a prolonged recession in the developed\ncountries which, in turn, has had a negative effect on the\nworld economic situation. This has been devastating for the\ndeveloping countries, which have had to labour in a harsh\ninternational environment. The crippling external debt is one\nof the major obstacles for developing countries. In Uganda,\nfor example, it is estimated that we shall spend about 60 per\ncent of our projected export receipts on debt servicing. The\ndebt problem has been exacerbated by the unfavourable\nterms of trade, especially the collapse of the prices of\ncommodities, which are the mainstay of our economies.\nCoupled with the reduction of resource flows, this has\nhampered our development. Yet, while still experiencing\nthese conditions, our countries have undertaken structural\nadjustment reforms which call for heavy sacrifices on the\npart of the population, especially the very vulnerable people.\nFor these programmes to achieve the desired objectives of\nsustained growth, it is imperative that further measures on\ndebt relief, including debt cancellation, be put in place, more\nso in respect of sub-Saharan African countries. There is also\nan urgent need to increase significantly the volume of\nresource flows in support of development efforts in these\ncountries. We look forward to the urgent and balanced\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations. We are hopeful that a successful conclusion of\nthese negotiations would increase world trade and increase\nthe access of our products to world markets. This should\nhelp to increase our export earnings.\nRegrettably, for Africa the critical economic situation\nand the trend of marginalization continue. It is crucial to\narrest and reverse this trend if Africa is to succeed or even\nsurvive in the geopolitical and economic system of the\ntwenty-first century. We need to enlarge our economic\nspace. Forging regional integration is an imperative if\nAfrica is to end its underdevelopment and to be integrated\ninto the global economy.\nAfrican integration will create economies of scale,\nwhich are essential for the diversification of the African\neconomies, making full use of Africa\u2019s natural resources,\nincreasing self-sufficiency and strengthening the continent\u2019s\nposition within the global economy. It is precisely for this\nreason that the Organization of African Unity adopted the\nAbuja Treaty creating an African Economic Community.\nThe Treaty stipulates, inter alia, the strengthening of\nsubregional economic groupings. In this regard, the\ncountries of the Eastern and Southern Africa Preferential\nTrade Area have resolved to establish a subregional common\nmarket. A treaty to this effect will be signed in Kampala,\nUganda, on 4 November this year. We appeal to the\ninternational community to be supportive of regional\nintegration by providing assistance to put in place the\nnecessary infrastructures.\nThe Rio Earth summit was an important milestone on\nthe road to forging a global consensus on sustainable\ndevelopment. Uganda welcomes the adoption of Agenda 21,\nwhich spelled out measures to be adopted by the\ninternational community. As a follow-up, Uganda has drawn\nup a National Environment Action Plan to address our\nenvironmental problems. We welcome the establishment of\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development and of the\nNegotiating Committee for an international convention on\ndrought and desertification, in line with the wishes of\nAfrican countries.\nIn spite of the progress made, we notice a reluctance on\nthe part of the donor community as regards fulfilling the\ncommitments agreed upon in Rio. This is especially true\nwith regard to providing new and additional resources. I\nwish to stress that for us in Uganda the cause of\nenvironmental degradation is poverty. Forests, for example,\nare being depleted daily because the people use their trees as\na source of energy. To reverse this trend we need capital to\nexploit hydro-electric power or solar energy, both of which\nwe have aplenty. We urge the international community to\nappreciate this problem.\nAs regards reform of the United Nations, we maintain\nour position that we shall support those measures which\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nimprove efficiency and which do not distort the priorities\nthat have been agreed on, and which reflect the interests of\nall Member States. We are also supportive of the proposals\nfor the enlargement of the Security Council to reflect\npresent-day realities. We reaffirm that an important criterion\nto take into account is that a country, big or small, seeking\nmembership of the Security Council must fully embrace, and\nbe seen to act in accordance with, the underlying values of\nthe United Nations mandate for peace, respect for human\nrights, democratization and other accepted international\nnorms. It is also important that the composition of all\nUnited Nations organs accord with the principles of the\nCharter, notably the principle of sovereign equality of\nnations and the principle of democracy. It is with this in\nmind that we shall examine all proposals for restructuring\nthat are before us.\nWe stand at a historic watershed on account of\ncontradictory trends which characterize the current transition\nto a new world order yet to be shaped and defined. We\nhave, one hopes, a unique opportunity to construct a firm\nfoundation for the edifice of a future in which the interests\nof all of us can be adequately catered for.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this\nsession of the General Assembly. Your well-known skills\nand your vast knowledge of the United Nations augur well\nfor the success of the session\u2019s work.\nI should like to pay a tribute to your predecessor as\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former Foreign Minister of\nBulgaria, for work well done.\nI should also like to express my appreciation to the\nSecretary-General for the dynamism he has brought to\nUnited Nations activities, for his constant efforts to\ncontribute to the betterment of the Organization and for his\npersonal commitment to reforming the Secretariat structures\nand improving the Organization\u2019s efficiency in the discharge\nof its functions and duties.\nWe live in a time of great hopes. The political events\nof the recent past have greatly facilitated adherence to\ndemocratic values, while at the same time they have\ncontributed to the world movement in favour of respect for\nhuman rights and have promoted the world\u2019s awareness of\nthe necessity for urgent measures to improve the living\nconditions of all peoples as well as the planet\u2019s environment.\nIndeed, in a short period of time a substantial number\nof countries have, against all odds, attained their\nindependence and recovered their freedom. The ideological\nconfrontation of the past has been replaced by political\ncooperation between countries, and conflicts with a long\nhistory, such as the struggle against apartheid and the\nsituation in the Middle East, seem finally to be close to a\nnegotiated solution. On the other hand, democracy, as a\ndesirable system of government, has gained an\nunprecedented dimension and support, although much\nremains to be done to consolidate it.\nThese are indeed political developments of the greatest\nimportance that shape and at the same time are the result of\na world in profound transformation. That transformation\nbodes well for a more stable future in the relations between\nnations and peoples. While on the one hand these changes\naugur well for a better, more humane and more just and \nstable world, they have, on the other hand, been\naccompanied by the resurgence of many conflicts, most of\nthem of an internal nature. Indeed, in many regions of the\nworld, especially in Europe and in Africa, ancient ethnic\nrivalries or internal struggles for power have turned into\nopen conflicts, leaving a trail of death and destruction,\nspawning millions of refugees and displaced persons and\ngiving rise to regional instability.\nI have been witnessing with deep concern the\ndevelopment of many of these conflicts in Africa, which\nhave a negative impact not only on the countries involved\nbut on the entire region. At a time when all our efforts and\nresources should be put to good use to assist the\ndevelopment of our countries and continent and to create\nbetter living conditions for our peoples, we have come to\nrealize that the scarce resources that we still have in our\ncountries are wasted on the fire of armed conflicts, and the\nfew economic structures that were left are being sacrificed\nto violence.\nThe armed conflicts that appear to proliferate almost\neverywhere seem to elude the efforts of the United Nations.\nIn most of these conflicts, the world has been faced with\ntremendous difficulties in containing and managing them,\nnotwithstanding the constant efforts of the Security Council\nand the Secretary General.\nSuch is the case of the conflict in Angola, a sister\ncountry whose suffering people have for more than 30 years\nendured the horrors of war, the anxiety of constant instability\nand the uncertainty of the future. Despite the enormous\nefforts made, especially by the United Nations, the conflict\nin Angola continues to cause death and the destruction of the\ncountry. The international community had placed great\nhopes in the elections of September last year that were\nsupervised by this Organization. We all expected that those\nelections would be the last step in a peace process that\nwould finally put an end to decades of destruction and give\nbirth to a new and democratic Angola, thus creating the\nclimate of political and social harmony in the country so\nmuch needed for its development.\nInstead, the events that followed the elections have been\nregrettably translated into a violent and tragic situation\nknown to the whole world, a situation which is a cause of\ndeep concern to us all and in which many thousands of lives\nare being lost, while the suffering of the population that has\nlasted so long continues and the destruction of cities and the\neconomic infrastructure goes on. Unfortunately, the repeated\nmediation efforts of the United Nations and other forums\nand entities, geared towards obtaining a cease-fire and the\nresumption of the Bicesse process, have so far not attained\nthe expected results.\nThere should be no illusions, for, as the long history of\nthis conflict has abundantly demonstrated, no military victory\ncan guarantee lasting peace and stability and the prosperity\nof the country. I do not envisage any alternative to\nnegotiations if peace is to prevail as a goal to be achieved\nby all in Angola. The use of violent means following the\nelections cannot be justified and, indeed, shows blatant\ndisregard for the sovereign will of the people, which was\nexpressed freely and fairly, as certified by the international\ncommunity.\nI sincerely hope that, worn out by a protracted and\ndevastating war, faced with a country whose economic\nstructure has been destroyed and touched by the social and\nhuman drama caused by the hostilities, the parties to the\nconflict, especially UNITA, will rise to the moment and,\nmoved by political realism, lend the negotiations the much-\nneeded political will and seriousness, thereby demonstrating\nthe magnanimity that the security and the well-being of the\nAngolan people require.\nThe Angolan experience is a lesson that should be taken\ninto consideration by the Organization in managing or\nassisting in the management of other conflicts. One such\ncase is the conflict in Mozambique, a country to which Cape\nVerde is linked by fraternal ties. My country, as a member\nof the Security Council, has been following the situation in\nMozambique very closely and with particular interest. After\nmany years of war, peace seems finally to prevail in that\ncountry. The General Peace Agreements concluded last year\ndefined the framework for the attainment of final and lasting\npeace. I therefore ascribe the utmost importance to the\nobservance and timely implementation of these Agreements\nby both parties. It is a moral duty to the people of\nMozambique, who are still going through the hardships of\nday-to-day life and who legitimately aspire to a future of\npeace, harmony and progress, that these Agreements be\nrespected and abided by.\nThe positive steps taken lately in this regard give me\ngrounds for hope. In this context, I consider particularly\nimportant the dialogue that has started between the President\nof the Republic of Mozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano and\nthe President of RENAMO, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama. I hope\nthat that dialogue will continue on a regular basis with a\nview to facilitating the removal of obstacles that might arise\nduring the implementation of the peace agreements, so as to\nenable the elections to take place on the scheduled date. I\nappeal to both parties to exert all their efforts with a view to\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 3\nexpediting the implementation of key aspects of the\nAgreements before the elections, namely, the demobilization\nand the cantonment of troops and the formation of the\nnational army of Mozambique.\nI should also like to refer to the conflict in Liberia,\nwhich has been the focus of the attention of the countries of\nthe West African subregion to which my own country\nbelongs.\nThe conflict in Liberia has caused much destruction and\nthe loss of thousands of lives, and has inflicted enormous\npain and suffering on the population. It has been a source\nof constant concern to the countries of our subregion. The\nCotonou Agreement, a decisive step in the quest for a lasting\npeaceful solution to the conflict, is the result of the\ninternational community\u2019s commendable efforts to establish\npeace in Liberia, efforts in which the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) played a pivotal role.\nThe recent Security Council decision to deploy an\nObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to assist, in\ncoordination with the forces of the ECOWAS Military\nObserver Group, in the implementation of the Cotonou\nAgreement is an appropriate and commendable one. I\nappeal to all the parties involved to abide by their\nobligations and cooperate with the United Nations and\nECOWAS in order to secure the timely implementation of\nthe peace agreement and the holding of the legislative and\npresidential elections on the scheduled date at the beginning\nof next year.\nThe situation in Somalia is one of the most tragic\nconflicts of modern times. This tragedy has resulted in the\nloss of hundreds of thousands of lives and in the\ndisintegration of the country\u2019s civil society and\nadministrative structures. The Security Council\u2019s timely\ndecision to involve the United Nations in the management of\nthe conflict and the humanitarian action of various\norganizations and entities have changed the situation in\nSomalia and created the conditions for the return of\nnormalcy to the country.\nI commend the internationalist and humanitarian role of\nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM), whose\npresence there has contributed much to eliminating famine,\nre-establishing order and guaranteeing the security of the\npopulation, despite the condemnable and deliberate attacks\nto which the Operation has been subjected.\nIt is imperative that immediate efforts be made, in\naccordance with the last decision of the Security Council, to\naccelerate the process of consultations and contacts with all\nthe parties and forces in Somalia, with a view to creating a\nclimate of security there and bringing political harmony and\nadministrative normalcy to the country.\nOn a more positive note, it is encouraging to see the\nprogress made in the negotiations to bring the regime of\napartheid to an end. The announcement of the establishment\nof a Transitional Executive Council is a major event in the\nlong struggle against apartheid which will finally be\neliminated with the holding of democratic elections next\nyear.\nNotwithstanding the substantial progress made over the\nyears in the field of peaceful solution of inter-State conflicts,\nthe tendency still persists in some countries to solve conflicts\nwith other countries through the use of force. The conflict\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait illustrates well such a tendency,\nwhich led to the disastrous Gulf war. Despite the tragic\nlesson taught by this war and the various resolutions adopted\nby the Security Council, much tension still exists between\nthe two countries. I hold it to be of fundamental importance\nto peace in the region that the two sister countries live\ntogether as good neighbours and respect their common\nborders, in accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nNot long ago, we all thought that the conditions for\npeace and stability in the world had finally arrived, since the\ndanger of a super-Power military confrontation and the\nrivalry between the two blocs had disappeared with the end\nof the cold war. However, we are now, paradoxically,\nconfronted as never before with a series of armed conflicts.\nThe time has come for a deep collective reflection in order\nto identify ways to contain these conflicts. At the same\ntime, preventive measures should be adopted to eliminate or\ndiminish the possibility of potential conflicts degenerating\ninto armed confrontation. Preventing conflicts is the most\nsecure and least expensive way of saving lives and\npreserving international peace and security.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" contains\na series of ideas and recommends a number of measures for\nthe management, control and prevention of armed conflicts.\nI believe that most of the measures proposed by the\nSecretary-General, in particular those having to do with\npreventive diplomacy, should be put into practice as soon as\npossible.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe United Nations and the regional organizations\nshould be able to create effective mechanisms to control\npotential conflicts and to eliminate the political and social\nconditions which spawn them. We should bear in mind that\nthe majority of the armed conflicts which today affect almost\nall regions of the world are internal, though some have\ninternational implications because of their repercussions on\nthe peace and stability of neighbouring countries. If we\nwant to prevent such armed conflicts, we should be able to\naddress their root causes.\nAmongst these root causes, attention should be focused\non the limitations imposed by the denial of effective\nparticipation by all citizens in the process of the governance\nof their country, as well as on the violence resulting from\ndisrespect for the fundamental human rights of the individual\nor of ethnic or religious groups.\nI believe - and this is demonstrated by our own\ndemocratic experience in Cape Verde - that the internal\nstability of a country and the social harmony among its\nvarious groups have much to gain when all citizens are able\nto exercise freely, fairly and fully their political rights by\nparticipating in the definition of their country\u2019s destiny,\nchoosing their system of Government and freely and\nperiodically selecting their Government leaders.\nThe changes that have taken place in the international\nscene have unequivocally demonstrated the importance of the\nprotection of human rights for all countries. Indeed, the\nrespect for and the promotion of these rights have gained a\nglobal dimension and are today one of the most visible\nglobal issues on the international agenda. My country has\na Constitution enshrining a vast list of fundamental rights,\nand the respect for human rights is one of the most\nimportant pillars of its internal and external policies. We\ntherefore welcome the central role that the protection of\nhuman rights has today on the agenda of nations. Cape\nVerde is deeply committed to the cause of human rights\npromotion. Our policies and Government actions are guided\nnot only by humanistic considerations but also by practical\nmotives, for we believe that the respect for human rights\nintroduces an equilibrium that creates internal conditions\nfavourable to economic development and social harmony.\nI therefore find it all the more difficult to accept the\nprecarious human-rights situation in which the people of\nEast Timor find themselves. In this regard, I encourage the\nSecretary-General to pursue his efforts with a view to\nfinding a negotiated solution to the question of East Timor.\nIn a world fraught with ethnic conflicts, respect for the rights\nof minorities should deserve the best of our attention and\nrequires a deeper national awareness and better international\nprotection as well.\nI commend all those countries that have actively been\npromoting, at the world level, the cause of human rights.\nHowever, I think that such promotion must not be selective.\nFor my country, the situation in which migrant workers find\nthemselves in certain receiving States is an equally important\nhuman-rights issue.\nSince Cape Verde is a country with an emigrant\ncommunity abroad that is larger than the island\u2019s resident\npopulation, I cannot miss this opportunity to express my\ndeep concern about the hurdles and difficulties that migrant\nworkers are increasingly facing in certain receiving\ncountries, difficulties that, in some cases, amount to flagrant\nviolations of their fundamental human rights.\nIt is unfortunate to note that in many countries,\nincluding some developed countries, the rights of migrant\nworkers are being neglected or simply forgotten. The\nworsening of the economic situation in these countries has\nbeen accompanied by a worsening of discriminatory actions\nand practices against the expatriates and the implementation\nof policies that frustrate the enjoyment of their hard-won\nrights, leading to their expulsion from countries where they\nhave, for long, been making an honest living and to whose\neconomy they have been making great contributions. The\nfuture of humankind cannot be seriously protected in the\nabsence of values that are inherent to sincere and fraternal\nsolidarity.\nHuman rights cannot be adequately promoted and\nprotected if, in many countries, poverty persists and if their\npeoples continue to live on the periphery of development and\ntheir populations continue to endure the hardship of extreme\npoverty. Underdevelopment brews conditions conducive to\ngeneralized and persistent violations of the most fundamental\nrights of the human person, especially the rights of women\nand children. Indeed, the poverty and precarious living\nconditions generated by underdevelopment give rise to social\nand political instability, which, in the end, will have an\nenormous effect on international peace and security.\nIt therefore becomes imperative for us all to work\ntowards effective cooperation for development in order to\nguarantee a minimum standard of human dignity and living\nconditions, thus breaking the chain of poverty and human\nsuffering. I hope that the answer to some of these concerns\nwill be found during the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 5\nIn this regard, the African countries are facing a\nparticularly difficult economic and social situation. Affected\nby drought and desertification, confronted with the social\nand economic strangulation caused or worsened by many\narmed conflicts, marginalized by a system of economic and\nfinancial cooperation more prone to respond to the needs of\nother regions and countries, and torn by widespread poverty\nand the worsening of living conditions, the African countries\nare in dire need of urgent measures on the part of the\ninternational community to assist them in their necessary\ninternal development efforts.\nAgainst this background, I commend the timely\ninitiative of the Japanese Government to promote the\nconvening of an International Conference on African\nDevelopment, set to take place this month in Tokyo. It is\nmy sincerest hope that this Conference will produce the\nexpected results. In this regard, developed countries should\nincrease substantially the resources earmarked to support\nAfrican countries in their development efforts, especially at\na time when these countries have embarked on fundamental\neconomic reforms, imprinting more dynamism on the private\nsector, promoting the economic diversification of their\ncountries and introducing structural adjustments.\nI share the views of those who advocate the need for\nthe democratization of Africa. I would, however, like to\nemphasize that the promotion of democracy cannot be\nreduced simply to the setting up of formal democratic\nmechanisms and guarantees. Our own democratic\nexperience in Cape Verde has taught us that, although\ndemocracy is the most desirable system of government and\nshould, at all times, deserve our support, its consolidation\nand full acceptance by all the segments of the population\nrequire a favourable internal economic climate so as to have\na positive impact on the creation of better living conditions\nfor all.\nI would like to seize this opportunity to emphasize the\ngreat interest that my country, as an island nation, attaches\nto the preparatory work for the First Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, which is to take place next year. It is my most\nfervent hope that this Conference, the first initiative on the\nimplementation of the decisions and commitments\nundertaken in the framework of Agenda 21, will produce\nsatisfactorily concrete results.\nCape Verde equally attaches utmost importance to the\nongoing negotiations on the draft convention on\ndesertification, in the implementation of a Rio Conference\ndecision. Let us hope that this draft Convention will be\nconcluded at an early date and will substantially contribute\nto the creation of the international mechanisms needed to\ndeal effectively with the devastating effects of drought and\ndesertification, which have been causing immense damage to\nthe economy of the affected countries and to the global\nenvironment as well.\nWe are living a historic moment, a moment full of\npotential for a collective future of peace and development.\nWhile on the one hand we have lately been confronting\npainful realities and negative developments that have raised\nreal concerns for those of us interested in the maintenance\nof international peace and security, on the other hand it is\ncomforting and encouraging to note the profound positive\nchanges that have taken place not only in inter-State\nrelations but also, and especially, in the redefinition of our\nsystem of values which will, we hope, in peace and harmony\nguide nations in their internal as well as in their international\nrelations in the coming decades.\nWe should seize the opportunity offered by the\nremaining few years of this century to act with determination\nand commitment with a view to consolidating democracy in\nthe world, promoting human rights and, at the same time and\nwith the same commitment and determination, recognizing\nthat the foundation for a new world order can reside only in\nthe development of countries and in cooperation amongst\nthem in order to arrive at solutions to the global problems\nthat affect us all.\nThis is my conviction as the Head of State of a small,\npeace-loving country that has always advocated dialogue\namong peoples and countries, and also as a citizen of this\nworld, which I wish were more humane and more united.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations\nis our Organization; we are its custodians, and we have to\nadjust to change. We have a huge responsibility to pass it\non in better shape than we found it. Historians in future\nyears will acknowledge this period of radical change.\nBut what are the objectives of this Organization of ours\nin 1993? Well, they are not very difficult to enumerate,\nbecause they are set out for us and by us in the Preamble to\nthe Charter, and they remain as valid today as they were\nwhen they were agreed in 1945.\nThe first, of course, is peace, because without peace\nand security no human society can flourish; then human\ndignity, because if we do not treat each other with respect as\nindividuals, we will not do so as nations; justice, because\nunless relations between nations are grounded in law, the\npowerful will always be able to triumph over the weak;\nsocial and economic progress, because without the sustained\nand sustainable development of our economies, all our other\nachievements will be as nothing.\nI believe that to this list we must now add the\nmaintenance of a clean and attractive environment. We are\nlearning, painfully, that our planet also has rights. We\nignore them only at our peril.\nThese are the foundations for the vision of what the\nworld should be. In New Zealand, we would say that they\ngive opportunities to all. When the United Nations came\ninto existence almost 50 years ago, the vision was sharper\nthan the reality, but the founders of the United Nations were\ncertainly not deterred. They were at the watershed in the\naffairs of the world. They had just experienced the awful\nreality of a global conflict in which millions had died, and\nthey were determined to do everything in their power to\nmake sure that such a conflict could never occur again.\nThey did build well. They embodied their vision not only\nin this Organization but also in a whole series of economic,\nfinancial, social and humanitarian institutions, and they gave\nit the only strength that counted: their sheer determination,\nas men and women from very different countries, to make\nit happen.\nOnly the utmost patience and perseverance has kept that\ndream and that determination alive through most of the\n50 years since 1945. Progress has been slow and it has been\nhalting. Some great things were done, but too often the\nMembers of the United Nations could agree only at the\nlowest common denominator, a reflection of the political\ngaps and strains within the United Nations membership.\nThere are, however, four reasons why I believe that that\nlong, grey era has closed.\nThe first is that the cold war, that shadow and threat of\na global conflict, is now over. Freed of that constraint, the\nUnited Nations can operate, as it was intended that it should,\nas the ultimate guardian of the security of all its Members,\nthe ultimate arbiter of world peace.\nSecondly, democracy, one of the most effective\nguarantors of peace between nations, is spreading. We\nwelcome the establishment of democratic institutions and\nprocesses in countries that have for too long been without\nthem.\nThe third point is that in the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations, the world has a major opportunity to turn its\nback on protectionism and lock in the prospects for\neconomic growth through trade and other forms of economic\nintegration. Freedom and free trade go hand in hand.\nFourthly, and last, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro\nand Agenda 21 contain a global consensus, a universal\ndetermination to act to preserve our environment.\nThis combination of developments marks a new\nwatershed; if we are to keep faith with the founders of this\nOrganization, we must do what they did in 1945 at their\nwatershed, and build well, not just for ourselves, but of\ncourse for those who follow.\nOn the issue of security and peacemaking, the first\npoint that I raised was that the elimination of confrontation\nbetween the super-Powers has opened up new possibilities\nfor the practice of collective security and peacemaking. The\nunfortunate consequence of 50 years of super-Power\nconfrontation is, paradoxically, that we are not yet very good\nat working together: like a novice sports team, we are really\nrather uncoordinated, sadly lacking in strategy, sadly lacking\nin team skills or knowledge of the new rules, and sadly\nlacking in collective determination. We cannot correct these\ndeficiencies overnight, but we must keep on trying to\nimprove.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 39\nThe other paradox is that peace has not broken out\nsimply because the former Soviet Union and the United\nStates have stopped squaring off against each other. There\nhave been unexpected consequences: some would liken the\nresult to taking the lid off a pressure-cooker. Conflicts,\ninternal and between neighbours, seem to have burst out\neverywhere. These consequences, in human terms, are\nhorrific.\nSo here we are, in the United Nations, underresourced,\nundertrained and facing an enormous peacemaking, peace-\nbuilding and peace-keeping challenge. We really have no\nalternative to learning as we go, and I believe that we are\ndoing so.\nDuring the past year, I have spoken to soldiers and\nrelief workers in the field in United Nations missions as\nwidely spread as Somalia and Croatia, and I pay my highest\ntribute to their dedication under some of the most adverse\ncircumstances. United Nations people are trying there, as\nelsewhere, to create conditions where their work will\nultimately no longer be required. They are actually trying to\ndo themselves out of a job.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s document \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\" is now in a consolidation phase. The problems are\nclear: rising expectations; machinery due for reform; lack of\nfunds; and the lack of ready, well-trained and well-equipped\nforces. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already made some\nthoughtful proposals, including sending teams to Member\nStates to help identify in advance resources available for the\nUnited Nations operations. New Zealand is willing to\nrespond positively to this approach.\n\nThe Secretary-General has also made organizational\nchanges in the Headquarters departments that support peace-\nkeeping. The revamping of the Department of Peace-\nKeeping Operations is a very good start, providing we\nrecognize that we need more than just a shifting of the\nresources. The new philosophy of peace-building and\npeacemaking must work in tandem with the well-tried and\nsuccessful peace-keeping philosophy of the past.\nOn the issue of safety and security of United Nations\npersonnel, recent peace-keeping operations have highlighted\nthe risks to United Nations personnel working in dangerous\nand unstable situations. That does not help the recruitment\nof peace-keepers, and it does not help the recruitment of\ncontributing countries. The United Nations must have the\nmeans to hold personally responsible and accountable those\nwho attack or commit other acts of violence against the\nUnited Nations and associated personnel.\nEarlier this year the New Zealand Government took the\ninitial step of calling for all possible measures to ensure the\nsafety of United Nations personnel. We asked the Secretary-\nGeneral to report on the adequacy of existing arrangements.\nHis report makes a number of positive recommendations.\nHe has highlighted the need for the General Assembly to\nelaborate a new multilateral instrument on the role the\nSecurity Council might play in setting the appropriate\nconditions designed to improve the safety of personnel.\nI was very pleased just this afternoon to participate in\na Security Council meeting that adopted a resolution\nwelcoming the Secretary-General\u2019s report and spelling out\nthe conditions the Council will impose in the future for the\nprotection of United Nations personnel. I was also delighted\nthat the General Assembly last week agreed to New\nZealand\u2019s proposal to include a new item on the safety of\npersonnel in this year\u2019s agenda. I hope that the Sixth\nCommittee will establish a working group to consider the\nissue and make urgent progress. I hope the subject will also\nbe very fully discussed in all other relevant United Nations\nbodies.\nOf course, any mechanisms for protecting peace-keepers\nmust also require that parties to any conflict respect the\nintegrity of those personnel that have been deployed on their\nbehalf. Such an undertaking should, in principle, form part\nof the mandate for any peace-keeping operation. The recent\npractice of the Security Council of establishing clear\nmandates for peace-keeping operations at the outset of\ndeployment is especially welcome, but there remains an onus\non a host State both to explain carefully to its people the\nreason for the United Nations presence and also to take\nactive steps to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel.\nBut the purpose of peace-keeping or peacemaking and\npeace-building is not solely to deal with conflicts that have\nalready arisen, urgent though that task is. We must improve\nour capacity to prevent conflicts before they break out, and\nI should like to acknowledge here the importance and\ntimeliness of recent improvements in conflict-resolution\nmechanisms and the ongoing work on preventive diplomacy.\nI welcome very warmly the contribution made by my\nAustralian colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, to the debate on\nthis subject. He has given us much food for thought and\nsome helpful suggestions for concrete steps we can take to\nimprove our performance in this area.\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nDisarmament measures remain a key element in conflict\nprevention. This year, as the international community\nmoves towards the extension - I hope for an indefinite\nperiod - of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, the Assembly will have non-proliferation as one\nof its major themes. In this regard, North Korea\u2019s continued\nevasion of its responsibilities under that Treaty demands a\nfirm international response.\nWe welcome very strongly the restraint being shown by\nthe nuclear-weapon States on testing and their positive\nattitude towards the launching of negotiations for a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. It is not before time. New\nZealand has sponsored a draft resolution on comprehensive\ntest-bans for many years. Its purpose now is on the brink of\nfulfillment. The subject needs to be taken up in the\nConference on Disarmament. Given the importance of the\ntasks now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament,\nmembership of the Conference must be open to all who have\nthe will to participate constructively.\nIn respect of conventional weaponry, we applaud the\nenhancement of controls through the commencement of the\nRegister of conventional-arms transfers. We now have a\nchemical weapons Convention in place alongside the\nbiological weapons Convention.\nIt is timely to consider what similar work can be done\nin respect of conventional weapons. As disarmament moves\nfrom the realms of Utopia into the achievable, we must lend\nevery effort, here in the United Nations and outside it, to\nensure disarmament\u2019s more rapid progress. No sensible\nproposal should be discarded simply for outdated ideological\nreasons.\nThe spread of democratic institutions to every corner of\nthe globe is, I believe, one of the most encouraging\nphenomena of recent years, and the pace is astonishing. In\nthe space of just 24 hours last week, the Parliament of Israel\napproved a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-\ngovernment; the Parliament of South Africa enacted\nlegislation establishing the Transitional Executive Council to\ntake charge of that country until a democratically elected\nGovernment is in office; and a constitutional Government\ntook office in Cambodia.\nWe welcome these historic events and the promise they\nhold for a more just and prosperous existence for the peoples\nof those nations. As delegations will remember, the Middle\nEast and South Africa dominated the political agenda of the\nAssembly for many years. These positive developments in\nboth regions will give a new cast to the Assembly\u2019s\ndeliberations.\nWe can also take heart from progress on another front\nof long-standing concern to the Assembly. The United\nNations is now three years into the International Decade for\nthe Eradication of Colonialism. The good news is that we\nare already seeing evidence that the goals and objectives of\nthe United Nations in this area are almost completely\nrealized. The number of Self-Governing Territories on the\nUnited Nations list is now very small, and many of these are\nexploring innovative ways to complete the decolonization\nprocess. The recent United Nations Seminar on Colonialism,\nheld in Papua-New Guinea in June, confirmed this trend. It\nalso revealed that in some cases some very small Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories do not want fundamental constitutional\nchange thrust upon them.\nNew Zealand has always been a strong advocate of the\nprinciple that in all cases decisions on self-determination are,\nof course, for the local people to make. We are comfortable\nwith the notion that certain Territories, such as the Tokelaus,\nmay finally choose to develop concepts of self-government\nand free association that further develop models that have\nalready been successfully employed for other very small\nformer Territories.\nIn that connection, and consistent with New Zealand\u2019s\nprincipled approach to all matters of decolonization, I am\npleased to confirm that the New Zealand Government and\nthe people of the Tokelaus have extended an invitation to the\nUnited Nations to send a further visiting mission to the\nTokelaus early in 1994 to meet local leaders and, of course,\ndiscuss recent developments.\nDemocracy is a sure foundation for peace between\nnations. It is the political expression of that universal\nrespect for human rights to which we are all committed.\nThe Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action arising out of\nthis year\u2019s World Conference on Human Rights gives some\ndirection to steps the Organization can take to strengthen the\nobservance of human rights.\nI believe we should move quickly to approve a high\ncommissioner for human rights. The United Nations needs\nan officer with a mandate to play a constructive role in\npreventing, monitoring and alleviating human rights abuses\nthroughout the world. The Centre for Human Rights should\nbe given the resources to match the immense task it will\nhave before it. There is a clear need for an enhanced\nprogramme of advisory services and technical assistance to\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 41\nhelp countries build up their national human rights\ninfrastructure.\nHuman rights is also about recognizing the rights of\npeoples to self-identity. In this, the International Year for\nthe World\u2019s Indigenous People, I would like to support a\nproposal that the United Nations declare a decade for\nindigenous peoples. We need to build on what has been\nachieved, first at Rio de Janeiro and subsequently during the\nInternational Year world wide. This is a long-term task. It\nwill require a sustained and very coordinated effort.\nUnhappily, our task is not just to enhance the\nobservance of human rights. In this last decade of the\ntwentieth century, we seem at times to be actually moving\nbackwards, witnessing the abuse and deprivation of human\nrights on a scale that we really believed we had put a long\nway behind us. The suffering of millions of refugees\ndisplaced by conflict is beyond our comprehension but\ncannot and should not be beyond our compassion. This\ndimension is starkly evident in nearly every issue now\nbefore the Security Council. Last June, the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put the\nfigure at 19 million people - 19 million displaced people\naround the world - and it continues to rise.\nIt is appropriate to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ogata\nand her staff for the way in which they are meeting, often in\ndangerous and trying circumstances, the challenges which\nthis problem brings. New Zealand has responded to these\nincreased demands by making a special provision for\nrefugees from Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia by\nestablishing special programmes for particularly vulnerable\ngroups, such as women at risk, and by providing aid. We\nnow have one of the highest per capita resettlement ratios in\nthe world. But this is, of course, addressing the symptoms,\nnot the cause. The ultimate objective must be to create or\nrecreate conditions that allow refugees to return in safety and\ndignity to their own homes and homelands.\nNor can we neglect the need to bring to justice those\nwho have brought about such suffering. The establishment\nof a war crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is\ncertainly a central pillar in the international response to this\nparticular conflict. The full achievement of the Tribunal\u2019s\nmandate is of the highest priority. At the same time, and in\na broader context, New Zealand also welcomes the\nconsideration being given to the creation of an international\ncriminal court. We would like to see further progress on\nthis issue made during this session of the Assembly.\nSustainable economic growth for all countries is\nessential for stability and peace in the world. A principal\ndeterminant for that is an open, healthy and international\ntrading system, a system that encourages closer economic\nrelations and strengthened North-South exchanges. There is\nno greater assistance developed countries can give to the\ndeveloping countries than to open their markets. A\nsatisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round of multilateral\ntrade negotiations would be of immense benefit to us all and\nhas been mentioned, I believe, by just about every speaker\non this rostrum during this debate.\nProgress to that end in the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade, of course, has been slow, as we know.\nMany deadlines have come and many deadlines have gone\nwithout resolution. We should not be under any illusion.\nCome this December, after seven years of negotiations on\nthe Uruguay Round, either we will have the liberalization of\nmultilateral trade with a benefit to all or the prospects of\navoiding global economic warfare will have suffered the\nmost serious setback. The New Zealand Government sees\nthe purpose of these negotiations being to lock in place\ntoday the politically attainable, and to build on what might\nbe possible tomorrow. In preparing for that, we also have\nto focus our attention on what is needed to ensure that all\ncountries are placed where they can reap the benefits of the\nfuture.\nWe still have much to follow up from the Rio\nConference on Environment and Development. But time is\nnot on our side. Environmental degradation continues to\npose a serious threat to the planet and its resources, and no\ncountry - no country - is immune from its impact. The\nlevels of responsibility for environmental damage may differ\nfrom country to country, but we must face up to their\nconsequences together. We must meet the objectives of\nAgenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. All countries should\nmove to ratify the climate and biodiversity Conventions, a\nstep that New Zealand took just recently. New Zealand will\ncontribute to the global environmental facility that is to fund\nboth of those Conventions. We have begun work to reduce\ncarbon dioxide emissions and are developing a\ncomprehensive strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas\nemissions. We are also making excellent progress on\nphasing out consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals.\nNew Zealand is ready to share its expertise on biological\ndiversity with other countries to assist them in meeting\nobligations under the Conventions.\nI suppose that one of the most useful exercises that we\ncan conclude here is to draw some lessons from the\nexperiences and views that I have set out. The most obvious\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\none to me is that, however important it is to deal with the\nparticularities of human aspirations for peace, respect for the\nindividual, economic well-being and a good, clean\nenvironment, one should never lose sight of the connections\nbetween them all. The Secretary-General has pointed out\nhow peace, development and democracy form a mutually\nreinforcing circle, and we agree. Getting the linkages right\ncan be as important for success as the elements of each.\nPeace and security are not likely to be soundly based if\npeople are hungry. Economic growth cannot last if the\nnatural resources used to create it are not conserved. People\nare not likely to make the effort required by economic\nrestructuring if the important choices are made for them.\nEconomic growth cannot be sustained if countries keep\ncoming up with new pretexts, such as environmental\nprotection, to justify excluding outside competition from\ntheir own markets.\nHuman aspirations and human security must be seen in\nthe round. That is one of the major challenges facing the\nmembership of this Organization. The work done by the\nUnited Nations in post-peace-keeping situations, I believe,\ndeserves renewed attention. For those countries where there\nis still a need to foster economic, political and social\ndevelopment, we should look at establishing a partnership\narrangement between the United Nations and the sovereign\nGovernment. A coordinating body comprising the\nGovernments and a group of friends of the Secretariat could\nhelp to ensure that the gains of peace-keeping are taken\nthrough to reconstruction. I believe that we need a new\ninstitutional framework to graduate problems out of the\nsecurity area and into a forum more able to cope with the\nneeds of redevelopment and reconstruction.\nThe second lesson is that we need to keep looking at\nhow well the United Nations is fitted to meet the challenges\nit is facing and be prepared to change it where necessary.\nMembership of the United Nations has continued to grow\nand I warmly welcome the newest Member States.\nMany speakers have referred to Security Council\nreform. The Security Council is in need of early reform.\nWe support a modest increase in membership and a fresh\nlook at the institution as a whole. The possibility of some\nmembers representing regional groupings for, say, a 10-year\nperiod is worth considering. New Zealand will continue to\noppose any extension of veto rights.\nAnother imperative is for the Council\u2019s work methods\nto be improved. Wider consultation with the broader\nmembership of the United Nations is essential. United\nNations agencies are also ripe for restructuring. The General\nAssembly has made a good start on itself. We have\nstreamlined the Committees, but we also must streamline the\noverall workload. It is unmanageable at present.\nFor several years now, we have been looking hard at\nways to fund new demands on the Organization by making\ncompensating savings elsewhere. We still need to ask hard\nquestions about whether all that has been done traditionally\nstill needs to be done. I welcome the fact that the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s budget proposals already envisage some major\nsteps in this area. He has also identified better contracting\nas a source of further savings.\nAt the end of the day, however, all that can be done to\nincrease efficiency and cut costs will come to naught if the\nfinancial commitment by Member States is lacking. New\nZealand pays its dues on time; most others do not. I urge\nthem to do so. Let us certainly go on talking about financial\nreform, but let us also secure the financial basis of the\nOrganization while we are doing so.\nBut what is the real dream that all of us have? I would\nurge all members to keep making, from year to year, real\nprogress towards satisfying those basic human aspirations I\nmentioned at the outset and to do so with a strong, well-\nequipped and well-focused United Nations. Specifically, I\nwant to see a reshaped Security Council, a more tightly\nfocused General Assembly, better peace-keeping practice, a\nSecretariat equipped to handle peace-building and partnership\narrangements, and financial arrangements built on efficiency\nand punctuality. Would that not give a point to the fiftieth\nanniversary celebrations that lie ahead in 1995, and would it\nnot make the United Nations of the next 50 years a more\neffective, more dynamic and exciting place to do the world\u2019s\nbusiness in than the conditions of the last 50 years have\nallowed? The deprived of this world expect no less. The\nwell-off know the world is too small for the huge gap that\nnow exists amongst all people to remain.\n"

        "file_text": "It\ngives me pleasure to convey to you, Sir, and to your friendly\ncountry my sincere congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. I wish you every success in carrying out your\nresponsibilities in light of the current developments and\nchanges in the international situation.\nOn this occasion, I should also like to pay tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the constructive\nefforts he made and the positive role he played as the\nPresident of the past session.\nSince the end of the cold war, reference has been made\nto a new age. The implications of this have given rise, not\nonly to hopes and aspirations, but also to caution and\napprehension. Although there was overall satisfaction that\nthe era of confrontation, the arms race and polarization had\ncome to an end, and while there was cause for hope that an\nera of justice, cooperation and disarmament was about to\ndawn, there has been grave concern over the great injustices\nthat we have witnessed in Bosnia; over the attempt at\npolitical suicide in Somalia; over the illogical and irrational\nwars in many parts of the world; and over the multiple\ncriteria used in addressing various problems.\nSide by side with concern, there has been increasing\ndespair and frustration over the continued deterioration of\neconomic conditions in most developing countries,\nparticularly in Africa. It must be acknowledged, however,\nthat international developments, judged fairly and considered\nclosely, are still in flux, and that the world situation is still\ndynamic. We truly hope that such dynamism is moving\ntowards the strengthening of the positive factors and the\nrectification of the negative ones, in order that the political\noutlook worldwide might change and that everyone might\nembrace the new world order with satisfaction and a will to\nparticipate rather than with despair and frustration.\nFortunately, this session begins amid increasing feelings\nof optimism in view of the ongoing progress towards a just\nsolution to the question of Palestine and of the steady\nprogress towards a solution to the problem of South Africa.\nAt the Israeli-Palestinian level, a major step has been\ntaken through mutual recognition by Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization. This means mutual recognition by\nthe two peoples of each other and mutual acceptance of the\nidea of coexistence with one another. This also opens the\ndoor to serious and substantive negotiations which would\nprovide an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a just\nsettlement to the problem that has cast its shadow on the\nMiddle East - indeed, on the whole world - since the end of\nthe Second World War.\nIf what has been achieved represents the first step\ntowards such a settlement, it will undoubtedly lead to the\nestablishment of a positive relationship that would deal with\nissues such as withdrawal, self-determination and refugees\nuntil the historic and comprehensive settlement between\nIsrael, Palestine and the Arabs is finalized. This may be the\nreal meaning behind the statement of the Israeli Prime\nMinister at the signing ceremony in Washington, D.C., when\nhe said: \\\"Enough\\\", and when he said that the time for peace\nhas come; and also of President Yasser Arafat\u2019s statement\nthat the Palestine Liberation Organization has turned a new\nleaf in its relations with Israel. And God bless the memory\nof the late President Anwar El-Sadat, who said: \\\"No more\nwars\\\".\nSixteen years ago, Egypt made a breakthrough towards\nthe outer reaches of the future and shook off the shackles of\nthe status quo by realizing that wars neither create peace nor\nresolve conflicts and that only reason and dialogue provide\nthe effective means of tackling problems, no matter how\ninsurmountable or intractable they may seem. Peace was\ntherefore initiated by Egypt, a peace founded on the solid\nfoundation of respect for international legality and on the\nresultant responsibilities in a balanced manner that ensures\njustice for all.\nThe peace process initiated at the Madrid Conference\nin October 1991 is now bearing fruit after unrelenting\nefforts, and we are encouraged by the initial outcome we\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 11\nsaw recently on both the Palestinian-Israeli and the\nJordanian-Israeli tracks and look forward to similar results\non the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Both countries rightly\ncall for complete withdrawal from their territories within a\ncontext based objectively on the principle of land for peace.\nIn order to put an end to the legacy of wars and enmity,\nEgypt, which has devoted a substantial part of its efforts to\nMiddle East issues, calls upon all the peoples of the region\nto look to the future and to reflect upon our relations in the\nperiod following the settlement of the conflict. It calls on\nthem to reflect upon the future of the region and its\ndevelopment to ensure optimum utilization of the ample\nexpertise available and optimal investment of the rich human\nresources at our disposal and of the valuable natural\nresources with which it has been endowed.\nEgypt calls on these peoples to reflect upon the most\nsuitable social contract for our region so that they might\nmaintain their respective unique, intrinsic characteristics and\nachieve harmony and integration among the region\u2019s\ncommon elements, so that social and cultural stability may\nprevail and the region may achieve comprehensive cultural\nintegration in a genuine era of comprehensive integral peace.\nFinally, Egypt calls on the peoples of the region to\ndevelop a system of relations based on equal security, the\nnon-use of force, a balance of armaments and the elimination\nof all weapons of mass destruction in a context of\ntransparency and peaceful relations.\nIn the same vein, Egypt calls on all States in the\nMiddle East, and particularly on Israel, to accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to\ntake the necessary practical measures to prohibit and\nrenounce the possession, the use or the threat of use of\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons so that the Middle\nEast may become a zone free of these weapons as called for\nin President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s initiative of April 1990. We\nconsider this to be an indispensable prerequisite for security\nand stability in the Middle East.\n\nSide by side with the considerable optimism generated\nby what has been achieved in the context of the Palestinian-\nIsraeli conflict, there has been progress in another area, that\nfor far too long has been a hotbed of serious historical and\ninternational conflict, namely, the conflict in South Africa,\nbetween a people calling for its rights to equality and\nfreedom and a regime that was based on repression and\napartheid. Egypt, an African state with an African people,\nfeels glad to see positive developments in South Africa, the\nmost important of which is the agreement on the formation\nof a transitional Executive Council that would lead towards\ndemocracy and equal rights. The Council consists of\nrepresentatives of majority as well as minority groups and\nwould work within a framework of cooperation, co-existence\nand understanding. Despite the many obstacles and the great\nchallenges that still lie ahead, the start has been encouraging\nand developments are promising. In this regard, we\nrecognize the role played by President De Klerk. We also\npay tribute to the role played by Nelson Mandela and his\ncompanions across the political spectrum in South Africa in\nturning a new leaf towards a common future.\nThe twenty-ninth African Summit Conference was held\nin Cairo last June. It gave the countries of the continent an\nopportunity to evaluate its progress on the thirtieth\nanniversary of the establishment of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU). The meeting produced the Cairo\nDeclaration, which reflected the imposing record of the\nstruggle of the peoples of the African continent over the past\nthree decades. The Declaration also put forward the member\nStates\u2019 vision for the future and their conception of the\nmanner in which they may adapt to the successive and quick\ninternational changes in shaping their conditions and\nrelationships. The Cairo summit discussions established\nmany landmarks that would guide the direction of African\nactivities in the coming years. They noted the options\navailable to the continent and the challenges it has to face.\nThe continent has expressed its determination to eliminate\npoverty, desertification and indebtedness and to initiate a\ncomprehensive development process for its countries and\npeoples and to improve their economic and political\nconditions.\nDespite the numerous problems of Africa, the continent\nhas demonstrated that it is prepared to shoulder its\nresponsibilities in facing up to the challenges posed by those\nproblems. Most prominent among its decisions in this\nregard was the decision to establish an African machinery\nfor resolving disputes. In that regard, the African States are\nhave set forth a new mode of international cooperation and\ncollaboration in shouldering responsibilities, notwithstanding\nall the difficulties facing the continent because of its\ncontinued low share in the world gross national product and\nthe increasing cost of debt servicing. Such a situation,\nthough restraining the continent\u2019s endeavors and weakening\nits capabilities, has not debilitated either its will or its\ndetermination.\nThe Cairo Summit was an expression of a determined\nattitude towards the indispensable need to make a number of\nadjustments to African policies and plans. It showed that the\ntime has come to take the difficult decisions required to\nbridge the gap between Africa and the developed world -\nindeed, between Africa and many countries of the third\nworld itself.\nMention of Africa leads to a discussion of the\ndevelopments in the Horn of Africa. This is all the more\nimportant owing to the fact that the developments and\ninteractions in the Horn of Africa are closely related to the\nsecurity of the Middle East and of Africa in general. Hence,\nwe welcome the independence of Eritrea and its accession to\nmembership of the United Nations. We also express our\ndeep regret at the situation in Somalia. In this regard, Egypt\nis fully cooperating with the international community, which\nhas moved effectively to put an end to the famine that\nbeleaguered that country and to the armed conflicts that have\nshaken its very existence. In the meantime, Egypt\nsympathizes with the people of Somalia in their aspiration\nafter a secure future based on a national reconciliation that\nwill serve the interests and meets the aspirations of all the\nSomali people and not merely the ambitions of a certain\nleader or faction. As a result, immediately after being elected\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity, President\nHosni Mubarak, inspired by Egypt\u2019s keen interest in the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions on the\nsituation in Somalia, coordinated efforts with the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of\nthe OAU to create the climate that would make it possible\nto achieve continued progress in the efforts designed to\nenable that brotherly country to begin the reconstruction and\nrehabilitation of its infrastructure and to permit its people -\ntorn by conflicts and dissension - to clear the debris of\ndiscord and to reunite. That can be done only by helping\nthe Somali people to achieve a comprehensive national\nreconciliation that would allow all its elements to express\ntheir will freely, without any repression or apprehension and\nwithout being blackmailed by power-seekers who instigate\npolicies of destruction and annihilation. This is a\nresponsibility that the Somali people, who fell prey to tribal\ndisputes and personal ambitions, must shoulder, and the time\nhas come to put an end to that situation from an exclusively\nnational perspective.\nMoving from Somalia to Angola where the situation\nhas been aggravated by UNITA\u2019s disregard for the will of\nthe majority of the people, expressed in free elections, Egypt\ncalls for absolute support for Security Council resolution 864\n(1993) which was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter,\nand which condemned UNITA and urged all States to refrain\nfrom providing any form of assistance to it until it respects\nthe provisions of the \\\"Acordos de Paz\\\" as well as the will of\nthe people of Angola and the resolutions of the United\nNations.\nAfrica\u2019s problems are not confined to those of South\nAfrica, the Horn of Africa or Angola. They also extend to\nnumerous African States whether in the form of civil wars,\nsuch as the one in Liberia, with its impact on its neighbours,\nor in the form of internal political dissension, like that\nprevalent in many African States at the present time, in\naddition to all the development-related problems and the\npangs of democratization. Nevertheless, Africa is ready,\nwith determination and political will, to go beyond those\nproblems and to embrace the twenty-first century and, all\ntotal confidence, steadfastness and determination, to be an\nactive partner in the formulation of the desired new\ninternational order.\nI began by reviewing some of the positive\ndevelopments in international relations that gave us reason\nto look toward the future with hope. However, there have\nbeen other recent developments in the world which give rise\nto concerns and fears. Those developments have posed an\nessential question among a number of thinkers: What kind\nof a world order do we need, and would such an order,\nwhose foundations would be laid today, be an extension of\nthe past, with its notions and policies, but in some new form,\nor would it be a mere reflection of the present with all its\nimbalances, contradictions and double standards? Or, rather,\nwould it be a real and genuine development towards a future\nthat may take us into the twenty-first century?\nLiving in just peace and prevailing stability is the prime\ndemand, without which none of our aspirations will be\nattained. Peace is not a passive or abstract concept. It is the\nexpression of the active and conscious will of all countries\nand peoples, small or large, to manage the common life on\nthis planet, with all its peoples, entities and groupings,\naccording to commonly agreed principles, values and\nguidelines.\nCertain principles underlie our concept of living in\nconditions of peace and security, the most important of\nwhich are the following: first, respect and support for\ninternational legality to maintain the reverence for and\npredominance of the law we have all accepted; secondly, the\nprinciple of equal rights and obligations to relieve frustrated\npeoples and to encourage them to utilize their expertise and\nefforts in joint and integrated action for the benefit of all.\nAll men are required to abide by the same rules in their\ninternational relations and to have a balanced share in\nregional and international responsibilities within a framework\nthat gives priority to public interest.\n\nThirdly, the same standard should be applied in judging\nall cases that are similar in nature. The same provisions\nshould be applied on a universal basis without selectivity or\nbias to ensure stability and security, reward compliance and\npunish and deter those who breach the accepted norms of\ninternational legality.\nFourthly, the principle of peace for all in the context of\ncorresponding and balanced commitments should be\nrespected.\nFifthly, the right to development should be respected\nand joint assistance made to developing countries,\nparticularly to the least developed among them.\nRespect for these principles constitutes direct and active\nimplementation of the rules of international legality. It also\nrepresents a sincere response to the will of the international\ncommunity. Their violation would threaten our efforts to\nagree on a more just and humane international order and\nwould greatly harm the credibility and progress of such\nefforts.\nI have to state here in all frankness that Muslim\ncommunities, and many others, have witnessed the\nmanifestations of repression and bias in a number of\ninternational policies. This has become apparent in the\nhesitation and inconsistency witnessed in addressing the\nquestion of Bosnia and certain other issues. There is no\ndoubt that a great deal of the suspicions of the Muslim\nworld could have been dispelled if the Bosnian problem had\nbeen dealt with according to the established principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter relating to\naggression, occupation, war crimes and crimes committed\nagainst humanity. All of those crimes have been committed\nagainst the people of Bosnia. This will not be forgotten by\nthose who have witnessed that tragedy unfolding under their\nvery eyes, day in and day out. Instead of addressing the\nproblem in accordance with the principles of the Charter, the\nblockade has been tightened around the people of Bosnia and\nall manner of procrastination and stalling has prevailed.\nEgypt rejects this flagrant manipulation of the norms of\njustice. Such manipulation rewards the aggressor for his\naggression. Egypt rejects this gross breach of human rights.\nHow can anyone justify this hesitation in the face of Serb\naggression against Bosnia on the part of the international\ncommunity that stood against Iraq\u2019s Government when it\ncommitted aggression against Kuwait? And if we approve\nthe demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border, why do we allow\nthe Serbs to expand at the expense of the Bosnian people\nand their territorial rights?\nThe protraction of the Bosnian problem without a just\nsolution acceptable to its people weakens the credibility of\nmany international policies and developments. The only\npositive development in this regard may be the establishment\nof the International Tribunal for the prosecution of war\ncriminals who have practiced ethnic cleansing. These\nprosecutions should target those who advocate or condone\nsuch practices that bespeak cultural decadence and\ncriminality in those who perpetrate or advocate them.\nThe issue of human rights is one of the major questions\nthat face us. We in Egypt believe that the human rights\nissue is universal both in content and nature. When we deal\nwith this issue in Egypt, we look at it through the\nperspective of the cultural and historical heritage which is\npart of our national identity. We view it through our\ndeep-rooted history extending through the millennia; through\nour ancient Egyptian civilization; through our Islamic\ncivilization, which is deeply impressed upon our\nconsciousness; through our interaction with the\nMediterranean civilizations; and through the legacy of the\nages of renaissance and enlightenment in contemporary\nEurope, which have had their effect on philosophy and\nmodern thought in Egypt.\nThe essence of this interlocking and integrated cultural\nheritage is the assertion of the individual human being\u2019s\nvalue, recognition of his role in working for revival and\nprogress, and upholding his right to freedom of thought and\ncreativity in line with Islam\u2019s sound principles which uphold\nman\u2019s personal and social freedom. Those principles\nmaintain a balance between rights and duties as well as\nbetween the individual and society, so that neither may\nencroach on the rights of the other and so that all may live\nwithin a framework of a meticulously formulated social\ncontract.\nAs we see it, the main aim of human rights is to protect\nthe real interests of the individual, his family and his\nhomeland, as well as his fundamental, essential and genuine\nright to live in safety and security. This is the primary right\nfrom which all other rights should emanate. All these rights\nmust be protected from those who try to violate or deny\nthem through terrorism or intimidation. All communities of\nthe world are now in the same struggle against terroristic\npractices, whether they emanate from racial chauvinism, the\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nradical right, doctrines of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" or religious\nfanaticism. All these doctrines follow practices that\nconstitute gross violations of human rights, and should be\ndefied.\nIn view of our firm stand in favour of safeguarding and\nmaintaining human rights - foremost of which is the right to\nlife and security - we are aware that real democracy is the\nbest guarantee of stability, security and social peace. All\npolitical freedoms and rights, individual or collective, will\nremain forever incomplete if they are not complemented by\neconomic, social and cultural rights. We believe that it is\nnot an overstatement to say that the right of the individual\nand of the community to development and economic and\npolitical progress is closely related with their political and\ncultural rights in general. They reinforce each other and\nneither can proceed on its own.\nOne of the challenges now facing us is the need to\ndemonstrate our collective ability to bring about a real\nchange in the world economic order that would transcend\nnarrow interests and considerations and rise to the level of\nreal world partnership in striving for sustainable\ndevelopment for all and the protection of our common\nenvironment. Such a challenge requires us frankly to\nexpress our views concerning current international\ndevelopments that give cause for concern with regard to the\nfuture.\nThe current world economic situation pivots on the\ncentrality of the decision-making process which remains in\nthe hands of the industrialized countries, with all that that\nentails with regard to the economies of developing countries.\nFurthermore, the current recession in the industrialized\ncountries is reflected directly in the depression and\nincreasing unemployment and poverty rates that plague the\ndeveloping countries.\nThis situation is exacerbated by the protectionist\nmeasures put in place by rich countries in trying to face up\nto their economic problems. Developing countries find\nthemselves helpless before such measures. They can only\nplead and hope. And this takes place at a time when most\nof the developing countries are in the throes of implementing\nrigorous programmes of economic reform. As the\nliberalization of trade constitutes a fundamental resource for\ndevelopment in the case of the developing countries,\nprotectionism deprives those countries of the opportunity to\nreap the fruits of their agonized efforts in the area of\neconomic reform and liberalization and severely hampers the\nintegration of their economies in the world economy.\nSo far, we find nothing in the Uruguay Round of\nmultilateral trade negotiations that augurs well for the future.\nToday, the developing countries find themselves\nmarginalized by side deals in which they do not participate.\nSuch deals are characterized by ambiguity rather than\ntransparency. They jeopardize the interests of developing\ncountries. On the other hand, the developments of the last\ntwo years have demonstrated that the international monetary\nsystem is no better than the trade system. Conflicting goals\nof monetary and macro-economic policies in industrialized\ncountries have led to a state of chaos in foreign exchange\nmarkets, destabilizing the world economic order, with all\nresultant adverse effects on developing economies.\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro was an important\nmilestone on the road of constructive dialogue between\nNorth and South for a world partnership to counter the\ndangers facing our planet. In spite of the meagre progress\nthat has been achieved in the implementation of the Rio\nresolutions, we still perceive a marked difference between\nthe perspectives of the developed and the developing\ncountries. The developed countries focus mainly on the\nsymptoms of the crisis, which represent a major threat to\ntheir life styles and their welfare, even though it was those\nvery countries which contributed to the deterioration of the\nenvironment.\nBy contrast, many developing countries continue to\nsuffer from environmental pollution for which other\ncountries are largely responsible. In their attempt to solve\nproblems of debt, declining commodity prices and trade\nbarriers as well as the problems of sustainable development\nand the requirements for environmental protection,\nGovernments found that they were facing a real impasse\nleading to low productivity and declining growth rates which\nin turn led to more poverty.\nIn the long run, the divergence between these two\nperspectives may hinder comprehensive world action to deal\nwith the world environmental crisis. In order to surmount\nthis dilemma, all parties are called upon to shoulder their\nresponsibility for lending credibility to and promoting the\nacceptance of the slogans of interdependence and world\npartnership.\nIn this regard, it is important to address an integral\naspect of the equation for achieving development and\npreserving the environment: the population problem, which\nthreatens both sides of that equation. We are all aware of\nthe extent of this problem, which completely absorbs the\nyields of development and will ensure the continued\ndestruction of the environment.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, which Cairo will host in September 1994,\nrepresents an opportune occasion for the international\ncommunity to address population issues from the appropriate\ndevelopmental perspective and from the perspective of their\nrelationship to issues of economic and social development.\nWe in Egypt, as the host country, shall exert every\neffort to ensure the success of this important conference, and\nwe are confident that its outcome will represent a sound\ncontext for international cooperation in the field of\npopulation and development.\nOur discussion of the conditions and circumstances of\nthe Third World leads us to a broader and more\ncomprehensive discussion of the political movements and\ngroupings with which the various developing countries are\nassociated, despite their different orientations and stages of\ndevelopment. It is high time for us to stop and ask\nourselves what these groupings have achieved and what can\nbe done to further their legitimate goals. We need to reflect\non this issue in a frank, constructive and objective manner.\nIt has become apparent that the challenges facing the\ndeveloping countries have changed substantially. We are on\nthe threshold of new international conditions and challenges\nwhich have different economic, political and security effects.\nIn Egypt, we have already begun to study this issue,\ntaking into consideration the positive and the negative effects\nof the past decades at the political, economic and social\nlevels in the Third World, and the implications for changing\npriorities and areas of concern. We have come to the\nfollowing conclusions:\nFirstly, the so-called Third World represents the\nmajority of the world population and the majority of world\ncountries. It has the major share in the production of\nprimary commodities, and it has vast market potential. This\nThird World is fully entitled to be a full-fledged partner in\nthe ongoing restructuring process at the world level.\nSecondly, in order to be able to do so, the Third World\nhas to mould a political collective will, and this can only be\nachieved through democratic open discussion between its\nStates.\nThirdly, this, in turn, can only be achieved through the\nestablishment of a political system or movement that would\ninclude all these States.\nFourthly, the ultimate aim should be dialogue,\nnegotiation and partnership within a framework of\ncooperation, collaboration and integration, rather than\nconfrontation or conflict.\nToday, I propose that the developing countries embark\non a dialogue aimed at establishing a grouping for the Third\nWorld, a grouping within which the developing countries\nwould deal with the political, economic and social aspects of\nvarious world issues, a grouping to coordinate their\npositions and shape their contribution towards the laying of\nthe foundations of the new world order which we hope will\nprevail during the 21st century.\nThe developments we have just reviewed, and the\nsuccessive changes we are witnessing, strengthen Egypt\u2019s\nbelief in the pivotal role of the United Nations in managing\ninternational relations in line with the principles and\nprovisions of its Charter.\nEgypt attaches great importance to increasing the\neffectiveness of the United Nations and preserving its\ncredibility. We are aware of the nature and number of the\nchallenges that face the international Organization, perhaps\nfor the first time. These urgent challenges were suddenly\npushed to the surface of international relations by historical\ndevelopments that were never imagined by the founding\nfathers or the drafters of the Charter. We all agree that the\nmomentum that characterized the past few years was so\npressing and rapid that there should be a comprehensive\nreview of the United Nations mechanisms and structure, if\nwe are serious in our effort to adjust the international will to\nthe facts of our age, and if we are eager to maintain the\ncredibility and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nIn this connection, and with reference to the envisaged\nstructural changes, I would like to state that Egypt, as one of\nthe States which took part in the formulation of the Charter,\nand as one of the founding states of the Organization, is\nmainly concerned with the continued presence of the United\nNations and its principles, message, prestige and credibility\nto serve the causes of international peace and security\nwithout interruption.\nNeedless to say, the burdens of the United Nations in\nthe post-cold war era are far greater than they were during\nthe cold war itself. If the collective will of the international\ncommunity agrees to make structural changes in the\nmembership of the Security Council, for example, Egypt -\nwhich is undertaking an effective role within the\ninternational order in the formulation of regional and\ninternational relations and in establishing the concepts and\nprinciples on which we all agree, in addition to its\nparticipation in numerous peace-keeping operations on\nseveral continents - has the right and the potential to\ncontribute in a responsible manner to the proposed\ninstitutional restructuring of the United Nations. Egypt has\nthe desire and determination to take part both in the process\nitself and in setting the standards and values to be used in\nthe process. Egypt believes that it has now gained the\nrequisite standing to be included within the framework of the\nongoing discussion and within the new membership.\nWe must open the doors to a better future in whose\ncreation all of us will participate to achieve the 21st century\nworld for which we hope. This is the time for collective\nformulation of a new solid and stable world order. This is\nthe great challenge that faces us all at a time of\nunprecedented opportunity.\n"

        "file_text": "Last year, my Head of\nState, Captain Valentine E. M. Strasser, acquainted this body\nwith the devastation visited on Sierra Leone as the result of\nthe civil war in Liberia. He described to this Assembly the\npain and agony that Sierra Leoneans have had to endure as\na result of that conflict, and the ramifications it portended\nfor regional peace and security.\nRegrettably, I am constrained to inform this body, not\nonly that the war in Sierra Leone has persisted, but that the\nlives of many innocent Sierra Leoneans have continued to be\nlost. What we are witnessing today is the internal\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ndisplacement of more than 400,000 Sierra Leoneans and\nmore than 250,000 others who have had to seek refugee\nstatus in neighbouring countries, not to mention the\ndevastation caused to the national economy.\nThus, with our territory devastated and our economy\nnearly destroyed, it is understandable that my country is so\nanxious that peace should return to Liberia. Without peace,\nSierra Leoneans cannot embark on the economic\nreconstruction of their country. Sierra Leoneans are also\nhopeful that if peace should return, we can start picking up\nthe pieces of what is left of our country and get on with our\nlives, and that the massive diversion of our resources to\nprosecute a rebel war will no longer be necessary. It is also\nour hope that with the conflict behind us, the Government of\nthe National Provisional Ruling Council will be able to give\nits undivided attention to the essential task of nation-\nbuilding. We therefore renew our appeal, from this rostrum,\nfor timely humanitarian assistance for the hundreds of\nthousands of our fellow citizens who have been displaced\nand made refugees, for it is only with such help that they\ncan start their lives anew.\nThe socio-economic assistance of this Organization will\nalso be necessary for our post-war reconstruction and\nrehabilitation efforts. Our cri du coeur is for the\ninternational community to provide the requisite support and\nassistance for a country desperately in need, through no fault\nof its own; a country that has acted as its brother\u2019s keeper,\nin the true meaning of that expression, and on behalf of the\ninternational community to bring an end to bloodshed and\nhelp restore law and order in Liberia.\nIt is, therefore, our hope that the latest Cotonou\nAgreement on that conflict will continue to pave the path to\npeace in Liberia. It was my Government\u2019s expectation that\nby now, with the assistance of the Security Council, there\nwould have been a rapid establishment and deployment of\nthe United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)\nand also meaningful support for the Trust Fund established\nby the Secretary-General for the continued engagement of\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) in\nLiberia.\nPart of that peace plan calls for the establishment of a\nbuffer zone along our borders to prevent the infiltration into\nour territory of men and mat\u00e9riel from Liberia. In the name\nof regional peace and security, we call on this Organization\nto give its full support to our request. International help for\nECOMOG is particularly necessary when one considers that\nfor the past two years, West African countries have been\nshouldering the burden of maintaining peace in Liberia\nwithout much outside help, in spite of the enormous\nproblems facing them individually and collectively. In a\nregion which contains 10 of the least developed and poorest\nnations, it is obvious that sooner, rather than later, the West\nAfrican subregion will not be able to continue with the\nECOMOG burden without such outside help.\nI would like to issue a note of warning here: the\nCotonou Agreement, in our view, offers the last chance to\nbring peace to Liberia. If it should fail, we fear that that\ncountry might become another Somalia. Hence, the support\nof the United Nations remains indispensable. We therefore\nhope that Member States will contribute, and contribute\ngenerously, to the Trust Fund. Doing so would save lives.\nBefore continuing with my line of thought, on behalf of\nthe Sierra Leone delegation and on my own behalf, I should\nlike to convey warm greetings to Ambassador Insanally on\nhis unanimous election to preside over our deliberations\nduring the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nIt is also fitting that I express my delegation\u2019s sincere\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, his\npredecessor, for the able manner in which he executed his\ntask and for his personal exertions in the advancement of the\nnoble objectives of our Organization.\nOur distinguished Secretary-General has, stoically and\nwith dedication and determination, continued his yeoman\u2019s\nservice on behalf of us all. We congratulate him warmly on\nhis latest report.\nI should also like to extend the best wishes of the\nGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone to the friendly\nGovernments and peoples of those countries that have joined\nus in this Assembly as full Member States. We have no\ndoubt that their admission has not only enhanced the goal of\nuniversality; with their new energies they will effectively\ncontribute to our quest for a more peaceful world.\nWe believe that our Organization is at a crossroad, that\nwhat we say and commit ourselves to during this session\nwill have serious implications on the shape of things to\ncome, and that the rebirth of this Organization will require\nlearning from the lessons of the recent past and adjusting our\nvision for the future.\nSierra Leone had sincerely hoped that the end of the\ncold war era would usher in a golden millennium of peace\nand prosperity for all. Unfortunately, however, we have\nwitnessed a series of situations all over the world that have\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 41\ngiven rise to a more violent and insecure international\nenvironment. We are faced with conflicts and misery that\nhave adversely influenced the lives of vast sectors of\nhumanity, and we now feel an even deeper sense of\nhelplessness and despair that makes us almost nostalgic for\nthe order and logic of bygone days. But nostalgia has no\npurpose if it serves only to pander to escapism, without\nusing the lessons of the past to guide our future courses of\naction.\nLet me now turn to an issue that continues to deeply\nconcern us all, namely, peace-keeping. The principle and\nefficiency of peace-keeping are not in question, but already\nexpenditures for peace-keeping have several times over\noutstripped the Organization\u2019s regular budget. More\ntroubling is the prospect that such expenditures will soon\nexceed resources committed to development since the\nestablishment of the United Nations. We sincerely believe\nthat the time has come when more attention should be given\nto conflict prevention and resolution.It would serve our\npurpose much better and cost this Organization much less if\nconflicts were contained and resolved before reaching the\npoint of open hostilities, when situations are more difficult\nto control. We can catalogue a series of lost opportunities\nof which one glaring example is the Liberian conflict. Let\nus, from this point forward, give more attention to the\nprevention of conflict rather than having to field troops in\nvarious theatres of war at exorbitant cost. Recent events\nhave proved that we cannot afford to risk the lives of our\nmen in the field in situations that could have been prevented.\nLet me reiterate Sierra Leone\u2019s firm conviction and\ncommitment to the peace-keeping operations that are now\ntaking place throughout the world. We deplore the acts of\nthose who have made peace-keepers objects of their\nviolence, and we salute the gallant men and women who are\nacting on behalf of us all.\nHowever, our perseverance in the pursuit of global\npeace and in peace-keeping will not reap the desired harvest\nif the present proliferation of arms and ammunition to\ntheatres of conflict continues. As we all are aware, many\nthird world countries where military conflicts are raging\ntoday do not manufacture arms. On the other hand, they\ncontinue to be the recipients of some of the deadliest\nweapons. Such weapons, when supplied to the contending\nfactions, be they rebels or others, have as their main victims\ninnocent civilians. Today, we are witnessing carnage and\nloss of human life, as a result of the use of weapons\nacquired by various rebel movements in Africa from arms\nmanufacturers over the years.\nIt therefore becomes obvious that, if we are to put a\nstop to such blood-letting and human carnage, further\nstringent measures must be imposed on the sale and\nproliferation of arms and ammunition. In our view, into this\ncategory falls the proliferation and ever-increasing use of\nmines and other explosive devices in the third world which\nhave taken a heavy toll in human life, especially innocent\ncivilians. Many civilians continue to die because of the\nindiscriminate manner in which these mines have been\nplanted and used by rebel forces ever since they were\nacquired from unknown sources. We therefore welcome the\ninitiative taken by the European Community to inscribe an\nitem on the agenda of this session of the Assembly to\naddress such issues. We believe that the support of the\ninternational community is indispensable to dealing with the\ndisastrous consequences of the presence of such mines.\nWhile still on the issue of conflicts, we wish to reiterate\nour support for the recently concluded International\nConference for the Protection of War Victims and its\nrecommendations. We are firmly convinced that\nhumanitarian law must be made completely universal, widely\nknown and fully respected, and must be extended to fully\ncover non-international conflicts.\nMy delegation continues to watch with interest the\npolitical developments gaining momentum in South Africa.\nYet, much as the ongoing negotiations offer hope for a\nresolution of this problem, we are deeply saddened that the\ncontinuing violence, directed especially against innocent\npeople - the majority of whom are blacks - goes on\nundiminished. Violence, in whatever form, is an abhorrence,\nbut its pursuit by unscrupulous groups and individuals to\nreap political capital, at a time when patience, courage,\ncommitment and tolerance are required, can only give us all\ncause for concern.\nWe therefore wish to appeal to all, regardless of\naffiliation, to exercise forbearance and to renounce the use\nof violence. But, more so, we call on all Governments and\npolitical leaders to use their influence with their supporters\nto prevail upon them not to threaten the democratization\nprocess and to work constructively for a better South Africa.\nThis appeal goes also to all emerging democracies.\nNow that the goal of majority rule is in sight, it is time\nfor blacks, who have for long suffered under the odious\nsystem of apartheid, to close their ranks in solid unity so\nthat, together, they may be able to let the new South Africa\ncreate an impact on the international scene, for their own\nbenefit and the benefit of all South Africans.\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe appeal to black South Africans to forge greater\nunity and to be conscious of their responsibility to disprove\nthe assertion of the apologists for apartheid that blacks are\nincapable of ruling themselves. For it is only when they act\nin unison and stop the violence that they will be able to\nenjoy the fruits of their freedom struggle, which they have\nendured for so long and are, at last, about to win.\nSierra Leone has for many years supported a\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict, based on\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nWe see the recent mutual recognition of the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as an extremely\npositive step towards the full restoration of peace in the\nMiddle East.\nWe also encourage all the parties to the ongoing\nnegotiations concerning other facets of the Middle East\nproblem to demonstrate the same spirit of accommodation in\nthe interests of their own people, who for decades have\nknown nothing but strife, conflict, suffering and hatred, and\nin the interests of peace and of mankind as a whole.\nSierra Leone supports the territorial integrity of Kuwait.\nI would now like to turn to another important matter in\nthis Organization: that is the functioning of the Security\nCouncil.\nUndoubtedly, just as a growing number of nations\ncontinue to encourage greater participation by their citizens\nin the attainment of the ends of the State, so must this\nnational awareness of the need for political harmony and\njustice be a paradigm instructive to the Security Council,\nwhich, as the primary organ responsible for the maintenance\nof international peace and security, should be perceived as\nlegitimate in its decision-making process and, thus, should\nembrace the views of a wider section of the international\ncommunity.\nIt is necessary at this juncture to express our concerns -\nconcerns that are shared by many small States Members of\nthis Organization - regarding the willingness of the\ninternational community, but more so its major players, to\nensure respect for the principles enshrined in our Charter.\nIt is clear that the time has come to articulate the normative\nvalues that are to be pursued in guaranteeing the security of\nthose who are not in a position to undertake their own\ndefence and to reassure them that their reliance on the\nUnited Nations as the guarantor of their sovereignty against\nviolations by stronger nations has not been misplaced.\nThe failure to halt aggression in some recent cases has\nseriously undermined the foundations of the common\nsecurity arrangement that the end of the cold-war presaged.\nThe repeated indecision with which aggression in different\nparts of the world has been confronted has set a dangerous\nprecedent by undermining the confidence of small nations in\nthe Organization\u2019s protective capacity and by encouraging\nautomatic resort to self-defence, with a concomitant increase\nin arms build-up. It also goes some way to assuaging the\nresidual fears that perpetrators of massive violations of\nhuman rights, even genocide, may have had that their\ndespicable actions will somehow be met with purpose and\nresolve by the international community.\nIn the coming days, there must be a firm, unequivocal,\ntimely and balanced response from the international\ncommunity to threats to and breaches of international peace\nand security if the Bosnian experience is not to become a\nfeature of relations between States. It is undesirable to allow\nthe view to prevail that the international community is more\ndisposed to act forcefully in certain instances than in others.\nIt is in this vein that we must express our concern over the\napparent deterioration of the security situation in Somalia.\nWe express the belief that, despite the provocation, a\ndistinction must continue to be made between the Somali\npeople, the warlords and gunmen. We firmly reject those\nwho want to impose tyranny on the Somali people, and we\nexpress our heartfelt condolences to the families of those\ngallant peace-keepers who have fallen while on duty in\nSomalia.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held in\nVienna in June this year was a landmark event which was\nable to overcome the numerous challenges that it faced.\nThat Conference addressed, inter alia, such fundamental\nhuman rights as the rights of women and children and\nreaffirmed the universality of human rights and the\nlegitimate role of the international community in protecting\nthese rights worldwide. It also reaffirmed the importance of\neconomic, social and cultural rights and the right to\ndevelopment, and it adopted several practical steps to\npromote and protect human rights in both private and public\nlife. The challenge now facing us is to implement the\nrecommendations of that Conference.\nWe would not like to reopen the debate regarding\nhuman rights standards. The United Nations established\nthose standards more than 40 years ago. What is important\nis that human rights should remain universal and\nnon-selective. Human beings all over the world, irrespective\nof their race, religion, gender or class, must enjoy equal\nrights and protection.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 43\nWe see the re-emergence of racism and ethnic conflict\nat its genocidal worst today in various parts of the world.\nThe United Nations must assume a much stronger role in\ntrying to prevent and minimize the suffering caused to\npeople who are subjected to the pain and intimidation of this\ndark display of man\u2019s inhumanity to man. Regrettably, in\nmany lands today, on every continent and among peoples of\nevery race, colour, language and religion, conflicts erupt in\nunspeakable violence. As has been observed, ethnic tensions\nhave become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies\nall over the globe - the advanced, the developing, the\nrelatively stable and the unstable alike. We must redouble\nour efforts and guard against such dangers.\nSierra Leone continues to be concerned by the problem\nof refugees and displaced persons, particularly as we\nourselves have become victims of such a phenomenon.\nApart from the effort to prevent and avert the flow of\nrefugees, if our people are to be able to return to their\ncommunities, remain there and rebuild their lives they must\nhave what the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees calls \\\"emergency development funds\\\" to meet their\nbasic needs in the areas of health care, education and\nemployment. While acknowledging the generosity that the\ninternational community has shown in the past in respect of\nrefugees worldwide, we appeal to that community in general,\nand to the major donors in particular, not to give in to \\\"aid\nfatigue\\\" but to meet the urgent and felt needs of their\nbrethren and sisters, many of whom have found themselves\nrefugees overnight through no fault of their own.\nSierra Leone therefore urges the international\ncommunity to look at these ever-present challenges: how to\nassist uprooted people, particularly in the context of conflict\nand grinding poverty; how to enable the displaced to return\nhome in safety and dignity and rebuild their lives; and how\nto prevent and solve refugee problems.\nHowever, while providing help and assistance to\nmitigate the refugee problem, we remain convinced that\nunless and until the international community can overcome\nthe scourge of poverty, that problem will remain insoluble\nand be constantly with us. It is therefore our fervent hope\nthat, even at this late hour, renewed impetus will once again\nbe found to prevent and eradicate this condition of human\nmisery.\nThe necessity of guaranteeing the foundation of a\ncommon security evidently goes beyond the reduction or\nelimination of military conflicts and embraces human\nsecurity as a whole. Indeed, the fortunes of many a society\nwill hinge on this, as in many developing countries the root\ncause of political and social upheaval or military conflict\nremains grinding poverty. Without the eradication of this\nscourge, the prospect for human development will remain\nbleak. Regrettably, for many of our countries in Africa,\nespecially the least developed among us, two years after the\nadoption of the New Agenda for the Development of Africa\nin the 1990s our experience has been one of disappointment\nand frustration. Even though most African countries have\ncarried out the structural adjustment programmes and put in\nplace democratic structures, the development partnership\npromised by the New Agenda has not been forthcoming.\nWith few exceptions, the resources necessary to get the New\nAgenda implemented have not been made available.\nToday poverty and underdevelopment continue to\nplague countries like mine in sub-Saharan Africa despite the\ncommendable efforts of this Organization to solve some of\nthese palpable problems. It is a matter of regret that the\nnew world order seems to have relegated the economic and\ndevelopmental needs and problems of Africa to the lower\nrungs on its list of priorities. The New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is failing because of a\nlack of funding and support from the international\ncommunity. The implementation of this New Agenda\nrequires the full participation of the international community,\nespecially donor Governments and organizations and\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. It is therefore of\nthe utmost importance and urgency that economic, technical\nand development assistance be provided to Africa by the\ninternational community, which unfortunately has not\nresponded sufficiently to our needs. We therefore call on\nour partners in development to give us all the support\nnecessary to make the reforms that we have carried out\nsuccessful and the sacrifices we have made not a mere waste\nof time.\nOur present situation also underscores an urgent need\nfor support for the effective functioning of the proposed\nAfrican Economic Community, which is designed to enhance\neconomic integration and cooperation in Africa. Financial\nand technical assistance must be provided to African\nregional and subregional organizations for them to be able\nto overcome the socio-economic challenges facing them.\nWe fully accept that responsibility for Africa\u2019s development\nrests with us Africans, but it is obvious that for us to be able\nto achieve and sustain the goal of development, particularly\nin the face of all the obstacles against us, including highly\nunfavourable terms of trade, we must receive much stronger\nsupport from the international community. With such\nsupport, the vast potential of the continent will be properly\nutilized so that we do not miss yet again an opportunity to\nprovide a catalyst for Africa\u2019s meaningful contribution to the\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ngrowing global economy from which we all must benefit.\nIt is for this reason that we look forward to the forthcoming\nTokyo International Conference on African Development,\nwhich should provide yet another opportunity for committed\ninternational support for Africa\u2019s development efforts. We\nalso look forward to a balanced and successful outcome of\nthe Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and an\nexpansion of world trade, improved commodity pricing,\ngreater market access and non-restrictive trade practices that\nwill work for the benefit of all countries, especially those in\nthe process of development.\nThe trauma that many African societies are\nexperiencing daily in the fight against poverty, malnutrition\nand disease must not be allowed to become a way of life.\nThe improvement of our people\u2019s lot is as much to be\nrealized through aid flows as it is to be guaranteed by\nlong-term measures aimed at addressing the heavy debt\nburden, discriminatory trade practices and depressed\ncommodity prices from which so many of us suffer. We in\nAfrica would dearly love to be able to lift ourselves by our\nown bootstraps but we cannot do so when our bootstraps are\nfirmly in the hands of others.\nWe face a most painful dilemma, wherein we find\nourselves in a position from which we presently seem unable\nto influence the forces that shape our destinies. But the\nproblems we encounter as developing countries should not\ndeter us from forging ahead to find new ways to\ndevelopment and prosperity. The experience gained by such\ncountries as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and\nother South-East Asian countries clearly shows that success\ncan be gained in the long run where there is sacrifice,\ndetermination and hard work.\nThis notwithstanding, Africa\u2019s underdevelopment\nremains unique, and unless the international community\napplies creative and effective comprehensive measures, such\nas debt-for-development swaps and other debt relief\nmeasures, the solution to Africa\u2019s economic crisis,\nparticularly for countries in the least developed category,\nwill continue to be illusory. In a world where the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor countries is growing wider\nevery day, the need for economic and technical cooperation\nbetween developing countries cannot be overstated.\nWith regard to the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development (UNCED), we welcome the\nestablishment of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment as a functional Commission of the Economic\nand Social Council. What now remains to be put in place is\nthe practical implementation of the Commission\u2019s mandate\nto ensure the effective follow-up of UNCED. Sierra Leone\nwelcomes the decision to convene a Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates in April 1994.\nAt the recent United Nations Conference on Straddling\nFish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the plight of\nmany coastal States, including mine, was highlighted\nregarding the lack of an effective monitoring, control and\nsurveillance system that can be maintained on a sustained\nbasis in the face of the continuing indiscriminate advance of\ncertain distant-water fishing nations, some of which not only\nfish the straddling stocks outside the jurisdiction area, but\nenter and violate the territorial rights of our countries. Even\nthe fleets of those nations which obtain relevant licenses to\nfish do not declare the correct catches for reliable data\nrecords. Consequently, the true state of exploitation of the\nstocks within the national jurisdiction of most of our\ncountries is not accurately known, and so Sierra Leone,\ndespite its location in one of the most fertile areas in terms\nof marine living resources, realizes only a miniscule amount\nfrom these resources as a result of the activities of the\ndistant-water fleets.\nThis present state of affairs is certainly untenable and\nshould not remain unchecked. The exploitation of our\nmeagre resources by larger nations and bodies taking\nadvantage of our technological weaknesses can only worsen\nour economic situation. These wanton fishing practices also\nthreaten to deplete the fishing grounds of our nations and to\nbecome great environmental hazards. I therefore wish to\nreiterate the support expressed by the Sierra Leone\ndelegation for the conclusions of that Conference, which we\nhope will bring about a radical change in the present\nexploitation of our marine resources. I hope our experts will\nsoon be able to sit down with experts of the United Nations\nto work out modalities that will ensure the equitable and\njudicious exploitation of our marine resources.\nLooking back at the progress accomplished by mankind\nover the past few decades of its quest for peace, security and\nsocial progress, we have to admit that the results achieved\nhave been mixed.\nA few years ago, for example, the world watched with\nhope and expectation as nations and societies were infused\nwith a new energy which held out the promise of a new,\ndynamic era in which our societies would at last realize the\npotential for peace and the global environment would be\ntransformed for the better. Then, many of us were\nconvinced that, if history had taught us anything, it had\nimpressed on us that this journey\u2019s success could not endure\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 45\nunless we divested ourselves of the old flawed and\ndiscredited formulae in which the age behind us had been\nembedded. It was our hope that, phoenix-like, we would\nrise from the ashes of unfulfilled dreams and start on a\njourney towards the fulfilment of our aspirations to a golden\nage.\nToday, some way into that journey, we have begun to\nwonder whether that dream was not a mirage, whether the\nnew reality on which so much depends will be shaped with\nthe good will and cooperation of all nations, big and small\nalike.\nIn the past, many of us called for the emerging order to\nbe nurtured and shaped by the joint will of the international\ncommunity as a whole, mindful as we were of the need to\nanchor this new direction on principles we all believed in\nand subscribed to. We are still of that view. Yet, though\nthe recent months have witnessed a process of revitalization\nin the Organization\u2019s responsibilities for crisis management\nand its larger engagement with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, we are increasingly\nconcerned about emerging trends that may not augur well for\nthe global political and socio-economic transformation we all\nanticipate.\nThe assurance of international security cannot succeed\nfor long unless we are able, as an Organization, to forge\ninternational consensus among all Members on measures that\nare of primary importance to us all. New energy should\nimpel us to find the source of today\u2019s problems, so as to\nmitigate the disastrous conditions under which a large\nsegment of mankind continues to live. New impetus should\nbe given to breaking the constraints that for so long kept us\nfrom gaining access to those in need and finding solutions\nto their problems.\nIt is our fervent hope that all of us, with new vision and\ncommitment, will accomplish these goals so that we may\nattain the new world order that was conceived within the\nparameters of the ideals of this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me pleasure to start out by congratulating you on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations at its forty-eighth session. I should also like\nto pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\nStoyan Ganev, for his able stewardship of the previous\nsession of the Assembly.\nAlso, I should like to set on record our appreciation for\nthe outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to attain the goals of\nthe United Nations and to fulfil the growing responsibilities\nentrusted to the world body in behalf of world peace. We\ndo note that the changes sweeping across the world today\nimpose upon the United Nations additional responsibilities\nwhich the President, Government and people of Lebanon\nview with hope and optimism. Therefore, we are all called\nupon to provide the United Nations with the necessary\nmeans for fulfilling its expanding mandates. By the same\ntoken, the United Nations should for its part streamline its\noperations in order to adapt to the demands of the future.\nI take this opportunity to welcome the Member States\nwhich have recently been admitted to the membership of the\nUnited Nations. This is yet another indication of the\nuniversality of this Organization and a confirmation of the\ngrowing need for it.\nAs the current decade brings us closer to the end of\nanother century in the history of mankind, we now have a\nclearer picture of the issues and concerns that dominate the\nthinking of the peoples of the world. In dealing with the\nspectrum of these questions, we need to rely first and\nforemost on rational thinking. The wealth of experience\ndrawn from the lessons learned from the numerous conflicts\nthat have taken place throughout this century has taught us\nthat the path of peace is, in the final analysis, the optimal\ncourse to follow, as all other avenues have proven futile.\nThe era of a divided world based on blocs and polarization,\nwhich severely strained international relations and\nprecipitated crises for many decades, is now over.\nTherefore, the world is now ready to develop a universal\nvision of mankind based on a universal code of ethics and\nset of human rights. The United Nations Organization,\nwhich has long suffered from rivalries that paralysed it and\nplaced severe constraints on its potential, is increasingly\ncalled upon, in an unprecedented fashion, to engage in\npeace-keeping activities. Despite the fact that its current\noperations are somewhat different from the conventional\nfunctions originally envisioned for the Organization, its\noperations demonstrate the growing need for this world body\nto lend confidence and credibility to the multinational effort\nin dealing with challenges and conflicts in a fair and sound\nmanner.\nWe believe that understanding between States and\npeoples hinges upon the preservation of democracy and\nhuman rights. Such understanding would in turn contribute\nsignificantly to the elimination of regional and global\ndisputes, in keeping with a major principle set forth in the\nCharter of the United Nations. Here, I would be remiss if\nI did not recall Lebanon\u2019s contribution to the drafting of the\nCharter as well as of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, for Lebanon was a member of the Special\nCommittee entrusted with the drafting of both instruments.\nLebanon\u2019s well-known tradition of firm commitment to\nthe principles of democracy, freedom and human rights, and\nits success in upholding those principles despite the dangers\nthat threatened it for many years, remains faithful to the\nbasic pillars upon which our pluralistic, open and creative\nsociety rests. Lebanon, which has withstood the trying years\nof its plight, is now facing its critical challenges with the\nvigour of renewed and consolidated national unity. It has\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nincorporated those principles into the fabric of its identity.\nThus, the new constitution proclaims that Lebanon is\n\\\"Arab in identity and affiliation, a founder and active\nmember of the League of Arab States, fully committed\nto its covenants; and a founding and active member of\nthe United Nations Organization, fully committed to its\nCharter and the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The State is an embodiment of all these\nprinciples, in all areas and spheres wherever they apply,\nwithout exception.\\\"\nIn view of its singular experience, Lebanon deserves\nyour support and a pledge from the world community not\nonly to provide material assistance and help in the\nreconstruction of what the civil war has destroyed, but to\nbolster the Lebanese system. The need for the example set\nby this system is all the more urgent in our world today,\ngiven the many ethnic and religious conflicts currently\nraging in various regions.\nLebanon, with its time-honoured tradition of\ncoexistence, moderation and tolerance emanating from these\nlofty human values, can indeed be a living example to those\neven in advanced societies who are searching for a\nsuccessful formula for social harmony. This is especially\ntrue now that Lebanon has put its tragedy behind it and\nembarked on a course of accord and concord.\nThe great majority of the Lebanese lived through the\nyears of war and bore the brunt of its devastation without\nhaving any real belief in bellicosity or its causes.\nThroughout the war, some one million students continued to\nattend their schools and colleges as if to express, through\npursuit of education, their rejection of war. The same\nmajority continued to discharge its duties towards society\nand the State in many parts of the country. Even ordinary\ncivilian crimes did not rise noticeably during the war.\nAll this confirms that the Lebanese, who settled this\nproblem a long time ago, not only in texts and precedents,\nbut also in their daily routines and life-styles, are proud to\nbe able to present to the world, after their long suffering, a\ntrue example fashioned from first-hand experience of the\nresilience of human nature with its wealth of intellect and\nvivid diversity.\nIn our common interest we must all seek to safeguard\nsuch a legacy and protect it from violence. This is\nparticularly true in the case of the Middle East region, which\nhas traditionally and historically suffered from the\ninterference of foreign powers and the struggles of interest\nand conflict that transcended national frontiers, and even the\nentire region, to pose a threat to world peace in its entirety.\nGiven the magnitude and intensity of the conflicts that\nhave ravaged Lebanon soil, the survival of our country\nproves that the Lebanese nation is too strong to be\neliminated and that it has long-established traditions that will\nstand the test of time. The people of Lebanon has\ndemonstrated great stamina and resilience in the face of\noverwhelming odds.\nLebanon is committed to realizing its aspirations and\ndetermined to achieve progress within the context of the\nopportunities offered by the modern world. If the armed\nconflicts and hostilities of recent decades have drained many\nof our resources, our potential and our capabilities must\nhenceforth be channelled to face up to and overcome the\ncommon challenges that confront mankind everywhere.\nTo this end, the Lebanese Government is striving to\nrestore Lebanon to its special position in the community of\ncivilized nations. The emphasis is on achievements that will\nmake the Lebanese individual capable of facing the future.\nLebanon considers that its major loss, perhaps, has been the\nmigration of many of its most talented and highly skilled\nyoung people. One of our major concerns now is to create\nfavourable conditions that will attract them back. It is our\nhope that our human resources will be highly instrumental\nin expediting the reconstruction of the better society we all\naspire to see: a society that enjoys peace, democracy and\nprosperity.\nLebanon, whose people suffered enormous hardship\nduring the dark years of war, fully recognizes and\nappreciates the various tragedies and pains that afflict some\nparts of the world today. As we reaffirm our permanent\ncommitment to peace and to the Charter of the United\nNations, and to the tenets that emanate from them, we stress\nour adherence to and respect for an integrated system of\nvalues which includes human rights, freedom and dignity.\nIndeed, this should be the ultimate goal of every undertaking\nand endeavour.\nEarly on, the United Nations took cognizance of the\nsituation in Lebanon, as attested to by the many resolutions\nadopted by the Security Council on the Lebanese crisis.\nSome people may not be aware that between 1968 and 1993\nmore than 80 United Nations resolutions and statements on\nLebanon were adopted. This is a large number of\nresolutions in comparison with other crises. Lebanon has an\nimposing file indeed with both the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council. If the sheer volume of United Nations\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13\nofficial records on Lebanon is compared with that of the\ndocuments submitted to ordinary courts of law, it will\nbecome clear instantly that, on the scales of international\njustice, the weight of evidence tips the scales in favour of\nLebanon. Justice and law have been, and continue to be, on\nthe side of Lebanon. Notwithstanding, the Lebanese have\nalways been deeply disappointed by the fact that political\ninterests have continued to outweigh justice and the rule of\nlaw, and led to the application of double standards regardless\nof the scores of resolutions that have been adopted right here\nin the United Nations in support of the legitimate demands\nof Lebanon, a country that sought effective recourse from\nthe United Nations.\nAll those United Nations resolutions have called for\nending violence in Lebanon and for respecting its\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus have reaffirmed\nthe country\u2019s political independence and national\nsovereignty. Therefore, we must give credit to the\nOrganization for its initial favourable response in regard to\nLebanon, especially in terms of the need to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) and the establishment\nof the United Nations peace-keeping force in southern\nLebanon. I avail myself of this opportunity to recognize the\neffective role played by the United Nations Interim Force in\nLebanon (UNIFIL). May I pay tribute to the many United\nNations personnel who have made sacrifices, including the\nloss of life, in the line of duty in southern Lebanon. To\nthose contingents and to the friendly countries that have\ncontributed troops, we express our deep gratitude.\nHowever, as we look forward to the future - having\ntaken firm and crucial steps towards restoring normalcy, with\nthe substantial and effective help of Syria in disarming the\nmilitias, ending the internecine fighting and restoring the\nauthority of the State, we feel we have the right to call upon\nthe United Nations at a time when its role is being redefined\nin consonance with current global changes, to act decisively\nin Lebanon. More specifically, we expect the United\nNations to work forcefully for the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), and to ensure\nIsrael\u2019s total withdrawal to the internationally recognized\nboundaries. It is not an overstatement to point out that\npeace in Lebanon has been, and continues to be, the sine\nqua non for stability in the Middle East and for the\nestablishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the\nentire region. Any peace arrangements will remain fragile\nand incomplete should the international community choose\nto tolerate the continuation of a situation that threatens\nLebanon with potentially explosive disputes.\nThe Lebanese have agreed by consensus on a new\nformula for national reconciliation, which was worked out in\n1989 at Taif in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nplayed the principal role in working out that formula, which\nlater became Lebanon\u2019s constitution. Furthermore, Saudi\nArabia, in keeping with a long-standing tradition, together\nwith other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council\ncontinues to donate substantial assistance towards the\nreconstruction of Lebanon. With the same goal in mind, the\nLebanese Government undertook the implementation of a\nrehabilitation programme in all spheres of life and in an\nunmistakable atmosphere of international confidence.\nGradually, Lebanon began to restore its traditional, regional\nand international role. This permitted Lebanese energies to\nbe unleashed, and gave rise to creative initiatives for\nreconstructing and developing the country.\nIn all this, Lebanon has faced up to occupation and\nviolence, by adopting a stance anchored in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Our country, which draws its strength from the\nsteadfastness and resilience of its people, has reaffirmed time\nand again its right to live in dignity and to ensure the\nfreedom of its territory. The Lebanese Government is\nheavily engaged in the reconstruction effort and the\nenhancement of civilian life in order to promote stability\nthroughout the region.\nIsraeli acts of aggression, which have clear objectives\nand purposes, have been met by the Lebanese with a high\nsense of responsibility, solidarity and internal unity. Our\nunchanging, spontaneous response is insistence on peace and\non securing the security and progress of our country, which\nhas paid dearly for having been used as an arena to settle\naccounts among conflicting parties.\nAn insistence on peace was the driving force that\nprompted the Lebanese to return immediately to their\nvillages and farms following the most recent Israeli\naggression. They pitched tents in front of their demolished\nhomes, thus demonstrating their deep attachment to the land\nand their loyalty to the territory and its bounties.\nThe true nature of the Al-Khiyam detention camp,\nwhere Israeli military authorities hold more than 200\nLebanese citizens without any legal grounds, is well known\nto United Nations officials and to Member States. Indeed,\nthe case of those detainees is common knowledge in the\ninternational media. Moreover, 100 other Lebanese\nprisoners are being held in various prisons inside Israel.\nDespite the repeated appeals by the Commission on Human\nRights and Amnesty International and the demands made by\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe Lebanese Government and human-rights societies in\nLebanon and the rest of the Arab world, the Israeli\nauthorities refuse to release them. Furthermore, for more\nthan eight years, Israel has denied the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross as well as family members\naccess to visit those prisoners.\nIt is high time indeed for Israel to respond to the\nappeals of international bodies by releasing those hostages\npromptly, thus putting an end to their drawn out suffering\nand the agony of their families. In fact, Israel is duty-bound\nto do so in compliance with the relevant international treaties\nand conventions.\nThe positive developments now taking place daily in\nLebanon are the most articulate expression of the Lebanese\nrefusal to permit their country once again to be a victim of\nthe Middle East conflict at a time when the winds of peace\nare starting to blow towards the region. Lebanon yearns for\npeace and has consistently opted for peace throughout its\nhistory. In fact, Lebanon can thrive only in an atmosphere\nof peace and stability. Indeed, its role in its own region and\nin the world at large cannot be performed in the midst of\nviolence and war. Lebanon believes that the Middle East\nregion, if it enjoys a just and comprehensive peace, will be\nin a position to contribute incalculable services to mankind.\nAll the peoples of the region, including the Lebanese, have\nenormous potential, backed by a great cultural heritage and\ndiverse capabilities. Energies and resources that have long\nbeen squandered on war could then be harnessed in the\nservice of social and economic development as we stand on\nthe threshold of the twenty-first century with all its promise\nof achievements to come.\nAgainst this backdrop, and in view of the regional and\ninternational developments that have made it possible to\ninitiate negotiations with Israel, Lebanon participated in\nthose negotiations two years ago despite the fact that parts\nof its territory have been under occupation as a result of an\nact of aggression committed by Israel in 1978 - and not\nbecause of a state of war with Israel. Lebanon\u2019s just case\nfirmly rests on a series of United Nations resolutions\nadopted over the past 15 years, all of which demand Israel\u2019s\nwithdrawal and define the necessary means and modalities\nrequired to achieve it.\nIf Israel uses the security of its northern border as a\npretext, we would argue that all the measures taken by\nIsrael, including the occupation of territory, have contributed\nto the disruption of security. In fact, Lebanon and the\ninternational community are more than ever convinced that\nthe only way to ensure regional security is to end the\noccupation of Lebanese territory and desisting from\ntampering with the security and safety of its population.\nForty-five years of unabated disputes, conflicts and\nwars have created certain outlooks. Changing such outlooks\nwill require great political courage and deep understanding\non the part of those who are interested in peace. Large-scale\ndirect support will also be needed, along with innovative\nthinking to shake ourselves loose from traditional frames of\nmind.\nMore than ever before, the Middle East sorely needs\nbrave, innovative approaches if it is to attain a firm and\nlasting peace. Lebanon, which is participating in the peace\ntalks in order to liberate its lands and lay the foundations of\na just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, wishes\nto point out the following:\nFirst, Lebanon demands the total withdrawal of Israel\nfrom all occupied Lebanese territories under Security\nCouncil resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978). The\nLebanese armed forces will assume full responsibility for\nsecurity in the southern and western regions should Israel\nimplement the provisions of those two resolutions.\nSecondly, Lebanon, which believes in and seeks peace,\nwould be among the first beneficiaries of a just peace as it\nexpands to encompass the entire region. Along with its\nArab brethren, Lebanon will be an active participant in\nmaking peace and in supporting its development and\nadvocating its consolidation as the underpinning of life in the\nMiddle East.\nThirdly, Lebanon which has had very painful\nexperiences as a result of the policy of the singling out of\ncertain countries and imposing partial solutions, believes that\npeace is indivisible, especially in cases where issues are\nclosely interrelated, as is the case in the Middle East. We\nalso believe that unilateral and partial arrangements are\nbound to give rise to nothing but new disputes and conflicts.\nIn this context, I should like to affirm, on the basis of\nthe object-lessons learnt from our common experience, that\nthere can be no firm and lasting peace in the Middle East\nwithout Lebanon and Syria. The accord reached between\nIsrael and the Palestinians will remain a mere single step\nunless it is quickly complemented by substantive solutions\non the other Arab tracks. Lebanon, which is extremely\nlimited in the size of its territory, has a delicate population\ncomposition and scant economic resources, cannot provide\na solution for Palestinians who have been uprooted from\ntheir land. The responsibility for returning the Palestinians\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15\nto their homeland and for finding a satisfactory solution to\ntheir status remains within the competence of the\ninternational community. If we really wish to put an end\nonce for all to the chapters of pain and anguish in the\nMiddle East, then the cause of the Palestinians should be\naddressed in such a manner that may ensure for them a\ndecent life commensurate with their legitimate aspirations\nand the aspirations of all our countries after human rights.\nFourthly, in order to achieve peace, Lebanon is willing\nto cooperate fully with the two co-sponsors of the peace\nconference, particularly the United States of America, to\nreach a comprehensive and just solution that would\nsafeguard the right of all parties to permanent peace, and put\nan end once and for all to conflicts in the region. Towards\nthat end, Lebanon stands ready to assume its due share of\nthe responsibility.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by congratulating the President\nand the other officers of the Assembly on their election to\ntheir high, responsible posts and by wishing them every\nsuccess in their work, which will certainly yield positive\nresults for us all.\nThe end of the twentieth century will go down in\nhistory as the period in which the cold war came to an end\nand which saw the dawn of a new world, a period of new\nopportunities to do things that only yesterday would have\ntaken a miracle to achieve. It is enough to recall the historic\nagreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO), the reductions in nuclear and other\nweapons of mass destruction, and, for my country,\nsomething that seemed impossible only very recently: the\nachievement of the high degree of sovereignty that permits\nus to speak from the rostrum of the General Assembly Hall.\nI represent a small country that can be viewed as an\noasis of democracy. But that is not strictly accurate: we are\nhardly surrounded by an empty wasteland. We are trying to\nfind our place in a new, complex world. In that quest we\nare guided by the following definitions: In the political\nsphere, our quest means pluralism, allowing the existence of\nvaried ideologies and parties that do not espouse violence or\nextremism; in the economic sphere, it means a policy\ndesigned to achieve a multi-faceted social market economy,\nwith equal rights and freedoms for all economic entities; in\nthe social sphere, it means a policy of self-reliance\nprotecting the most vulnerable sectors of our population; in\nthe legal sphere, it means legal safeguards for the interests\nof all citizens, economic entities, parties and movements, as\nwell as for the State; in the area of religion, it means\ntolerance and the application of ethical principles; in the\nsphere of building the structures of State authority, it means\nforming coalition groups with broad participation by officials\nfrom many parties and movements.\nThe linchpin of our policy is acknowledgement of the\npriority of humanitarian values and of the natural right of the\nindividual to happiness. The new Constitution of\nKyrgyzstan clearly lays down these basic principles, through\nwhich we are attempting, in spite of difficulties, to establish\nour chosen State model.\nMy purpose in this statement is not just to give an idea\nof our Republic\u2019s political prospects. I shall try to take a\nbroader approach to issues; perhaps to some extent this is a\nprerequisite for our acknowledgement by the world\ncommunity. The process of the victory of democracy in\nKyrgyzstan, and in the other Republics of the former Soviet\nUnion, seems paradoxical and almost irrational.\nRevolutionary changes have taken place at the top levels of\nthe political elite. These changes were welcomed, as I see\nit, primarily because by that time we had already achieved\nthe democratic victory of glasnost. What happened could be\nexpressed as follows: the storming of the Bastille was\npreceded by The Marriage of Figaro. Our reforms began\nnot with the economy but with politics. How could it be\notherwise, since Kyrgyzstan had no elements of a market\neconomy, and property ownership was distorted?\nKyrgyzstan today is one of the few independent States of the\nformer Soviet Union to have adopted and be carrying out a\nprogramme of economic reforms for transition to a market\neconomy, as approved by the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank.\nFor a number of objective reasons pertaining to the\nstructure of production and current shortages of energy\nsources, such as oil and gas, implementation of\nrecommendations for our Republic has caused us social and\neconomic difficulties. Our country has a dire need for\nmedicines, and a balanced diet is lacking. Thousands and\nthousands of young people are coming into the cities from\nthe villages without any real professional training or any\nchance of prospering. Furthermore, we cannot yet give our\neconomy the necessary impetus to enable us quickly to solve\nthese and other major social problems. We need investment.\nLike other relatively small countries, we need a kind of\nMarshall Plan. The experience of many States has shown\nthat this would be profitable for the wealthy countries and\ndonors in many ways.\nI would not venture to say that, but for my firm\nconviction that the ability to empathize with the suffering of\nothers has always been a strong point of the United Nations;\nin fact, it is what has given it its high standing in the eyes\nof the world. This is not a case of political parasitism. We\nfirmly intend to pay off all of our debts, and we fully\nrecognize that the usefulness of these policies can be\nmeasured only by mutual advantage, and that the results of\nany foreign policy activity, including the economic aspects,\ndepend on the participation of others and the ability to pay,\nin the broad sense of the words.\nFor the world community, for large and small countries,\none thing is becoming more evident: there exists not only\neconomic power, the power of gold and production, not only\nbrute military power, but also spiritual power. I am talking\nnot about the cruel, soulless and heartless fanaticism of some\npeople, not about trends and faiths whose history is written\nin blood, but about lofty and pure ethical values which bind\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 17\ntogether people who espouse them. These values and ideals\nare the moral postulates of religion.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nI wish to draw attention to what I regard as a special\ntopic. We have been witnessing tragic conflicts with\nreligious roots. One possible solution to this problem would\nbe to adopt a universal convention on freedom of religion,\nwhich would call upon people of different faiths to apply\nethical and moral principles for the sake of peace and\nharmony.\nThe United Nations is recognized to be a universal\nOrganization, and as such not to be at variance with other\ninstitutions of the world community. No, it is in those\ninstitutions, in the specialized agencies and regional\norganizations, that we find the embodiment of the ideals and\nprinciples of the United Nations. With this in view, I would\nlike to draw attention to the problem of establishing a\ncollective security system in Asia. In principle, the\ndelegation of Kyrgyzstan agrees with what previous speakers\nhave said in this regard. On the other hand, a collective\nsecurity system in Asia cannot be established quickly, or as\nquickly as might be hoped. In this connection, no doubt the\nbest we can do is to ask the Secretary-General to conduct a\nstudy, which could give us useful guidelines for future work\non such an important problem.\nNaturally, I have covered only a few issues, against the\nbackdrop of upheavals in the political and social life of the\nworld today. But I still hope that I have drawn attention to\nmajor issues of interest to us all.\nEvery State whose representative has addressed the\nAssembly has made recommendations, and further valuable\nrecommendations and proposals will be made, based on the\nhigh ideals of our Organization, whose focal point should be\nthe individual and his or her prosperity and happiness. We\nfully agree with these proposals and hope that the creative\nenergy involved will not be self-destructive.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally, on his election as President of the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As a fellow\nCommonwealth member with Guyana, Australia is very\npleased to serve in the Assembly under his presidency.\nThis session of the General Assembly will deal with a\nparticularly heavy and important agenda. It will do so at a\ntime when hopes for, and expectations of, the United\nNations have never been greater - but when, at the same\ntime, many doubts have been raised about the capacity of the\nUnited Nations system to cope. We will be relying very\nmuch, Mr. President, on your wisdom and your experience\nas you preside over our deliberations.\n\nThe world is a rather less happy place than we all\nhoped it would be after the end of the cold war. Economic\nand social deprivation continues to be a harsh daily reality\nfor many of our countries and our peoples. Not even the\nmost advanced countries are immune. The developed\nWestern economies are limping, with low growth rates,\nhistorically high unemployment rates, increasing disparities\nas a result between rich and poor, and a continuing inability\nso far to reach agreement - either between themselves or\nwith the rest of the world\u2019s trading nations - about the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalization\nmeasures so necessary to give a new kick-start to world\ntrade and economic growth.\nIn the non-Western world, rates of growth have been\nextraordinarily uneven. The spectacular advance in some\nregions, in particular East Asia, has been in stark contrast to\nthe continuing terrible deprivation and poverty in others.\nSome States have simply been unable to cope with exploding\ninternal economic, political and social problems, and for all\npractical purposes have collapsed, leaving the international\ncommunity to respond, somehow, to the humanitarian crises\nthat have followed so often.\nIn security terms, the end of the cold war has seen the\nend of the super-Power nuclear-arms race and has relieved\nus of the immediate threat of nuclear devastation. We have\nseen major achievements in nuclear-arms reduction; and for\nthe first time in the history of the nuclear age a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty, which would ban all nuclear\ntests in all environments for all time, seems within our\nreach. We could help to make it even more so by adopting\nby consensus a resolution in this Assembly supporting the\nnegotiation of that treaty. A very great deal, of course,\ndepends on the current moratorium on all nuclear testing\nbeing maintained. We in Australia very strongly support\nwhat President Clinton said in that respect this morning.\nThis year we signed at last, after 20 years of\nnegotiation, the chemical weapons Convention. But much\nremains to be done to bring this and other instruments into\neffective operation. And there are still too many countries\nunwilling to submit themselves to the disciplines, more\nimportant and more necessary now than ever, of the nuclear\nnon-proliferation Treaty.\nThe threat of conflicts between States has certainly not\ndiminished with the end of the cold war. If anything, the\nremoval of the cold-war gridlock - the discipline imposed by\nthe super-Powers on each other and their respective\nsupporters - has created more room than ever for States to\nmanoeuvre. Some are beginning to do so, and some are\nbound to seek to do so in the future. Some of the emerging\neconomic Powers have yet to acquire political or military\nprofiles commensurate with their new wealth, and the\nprocess of adjustment certainly has ample potential to\ngenerate regional tensions. Should those tensions escalate\ninto conflict, the unhappy reality is that proliferation of more\nsophisticated conventional weapons and proliferation of the\ncapacity to develop weapons of mass destruction make any\nprospect of major regional conflict an alarming one for the\nworld as a whole.\nThe release of cold-war pressures has been associated\nwith another major new development of security concern\nwith which we are all now disturbingly familiar: the\nresurgence of ethno-nationalism, often taking a violent form.\nSome ethnic groups are being prepared to pursue their\nclaims for self-determination within the framework of\nexisting States, arguing essentially for minority human rights\nprotection - claims of right which, on first principles, we\nshould all be prepared to acknowledge and support. But\nmany other such groups have made clear that they will be\nsatisfied by nothing less than their nations becoming States,\ncausing the fragmentation of existing States in the process,\nand creating some very real dilemmas for the international\ncommunity as a result. Again, the proliferating availability\nof weaponry of every degree of sophistication has given a\nsharp new edge to these concerns.\nLooking out upon a world with all these characteristics,\nit is easy to be pessimistic and fatalistic. But I do not think\nwe should retreat into that habit of mind. For everything\nthat has gone wrong over the last few years, there is\nsomething else that has gone right. To match against the\nawful continuing tragedy in the former Yugoslavia, we have,\nfor example, this month\u2019s peace agreement in the Middle\nEast - of course, only the first step in what remains a long\njourney, but an enormously encouraging one\nnotwithstanding. And to match against the continuing chaos\nand uncertainty in Somalia, and the at best very limited\nsuccess of the United Nations operation there, we have now\nthe unquestioned success of the United Nations operation in\nCambodia - and the end at last to more than 20 years of\nwhat has been a real twentieth-century tragedy involving\nbloody war, civil war, genocide, invasion and civil war\nagain.\nA terrible conflict continues in Angola, but peace is at\nhand at last in Mozambique; and in South Africa the final\ndeath of apartheid is imminent, as testified last week in this\nplace by Nelson Mandela. Military regimes have given way\nto democratic ones throughout Latin America. Many\nproblems remain to be solved in the former Soviet Union,\nbut Governments that can credibly claim to reflect the will\nof their peoples are in place throughout Central and Eastern\nEurope. The military regime in Myanmar, or Burma,\ncontinues to resist the obvious mood of its people for liberty\nand democracy, but elsewhere in the region traditionally\nmonolithic government structures - driven in many cases by\neconomic imperatives - are beginning to show signs of\nflexibility and responsiveness.\nBut while I do not believe that we should be unduly\npessimistic or fatalistic about the condition of the world\naround us, nor can we afford to be complacent. There is\nmuch more that we can and should be doing to reinforce and\nstrengthen the international community\u2019s capacity to govern\nitself better, and in particular to better guarantee the\nmaintenance of peace and security in the post-cold-war\nworld. It is on this subject - the role of the United Nations\nand the international community generally in securing peace\nin the world of the 1990s and beyond that I want specifically\nto focus my remarks today.\nA little over a year ago, following a unique meeting of\nthe Security Council, Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali\npublished \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". It was and remains a\nremarkable document, one which poses most of the questions\nwe need to address if we are to have a fair chance of\nmaintaining international peace and security in the world of\ntoday and the foreseeable future. Since that time, a\nworldwide debate has taken place on the issues described in\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which has involved not only\nGovernments and officials, but has reached out to embrace\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 25\nuniversities, foundations, non-governmental organizations\nand many organs of the public media as well. This debate\ngenerated resolutions at the last session of the General\nAssembly, several worthwhile changes to some procedures\nand structures within the Secretariat, and the prospect of\nfurther changes to come.\nIt cannot be said, however, that the issues raised by\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" are now all settled, either in theory\nor in practice. We still do not have even a completely clear\nand consistent shared vocabulary to define the ways in which\nit is possible for the United Nations and other organs of the\ninternational community to respond to security problems:\n\\\"peacemaking\\\", for example, means different things still to\ndifferent people; so do \\\"preventive diplomacy\\\" and \\\"peace\nbuilding\\\"; the conceptual boundary between \\\"peace-keeping\\\"\non the one hand and \\\"peace enforcement\\\" on the other is not\ndrawn in the same way by everyone who uses these terms.\nNor do we seem yet to have clear and universal\nagreement even as to the kind of problems which justify a\nsecurity response by the international community. Should\nwe recognize, for example, a humanitarian right of\nintervention and, if so, in what circumstances and to what\nextent? When does an economic or social problem become\nthe kind of security problem which justifies the mobilization\nof the response strategies spelt out in Chapters VI and VII\nof the United Nations Charter?\nEven when it comes to applying a very familiar\nresponse to a new problem - for example, establishing a\npeace-keeping operation like the 30 which have now been\ninitiated since 1946 - there does not yet seem to have been\ndeveloped a commonly accepted check list of criteria to\nguide decision-makers in determining when precisely the\noperation should be set in train, how it should be structured,\nmanaged and resourced, or how long it should continue.\nEvery situation, of course, has its own characteristics, but is\nit really necessary for decisions on these matters by the\nSecurity Council or others to be made on so evidently ad\nhoc a basis?\nWhen it comes to thinking about how the United\nNations - and others in the international community,\nincluding regional organizations - might best be structured,\norganized, managed and funded to most effectively address\nthe international peace and security agenda, it is not clear to\nme that we have yet heard the last word in that debate.\nAn extraordinary amount has been achieved in the\ntumultuous period since 1989 in responding to the new\ndemands and challenges that have been unceasingly hurled\nat the United Nations, but a good deal more remains to be\ndone if the United Nations in particular, the only fully\nempowered body with global membership that we have, is\nto be as effective as we would all want it to be.\nIt is much easier, of course, to ask all these questions\nthan to answer them. Identifying problems is always easier\nthan defining acceptable solutions. But I believe that we all\nhave a responsibility to each other and the international\ncommunity to try to answer these questions and to keep on\nworking away at the answers until we find common ground.\nSo it is in that spirit that I put before the Assembly today a\ndetailed study of these questions, which tries to answer them\nin a way which might help us find a little more of that\ncommon ground.\nThe study, in the form of a book entitled Cooperating\nfor Peace, has been distributed, I hope, to delegations as I\nspeak. I do not pretend for a moment that this says the last\nword on any of the enormously complex and sensitive issues\nwith which it deals. It is simply an Australian contribution\nto the debate which was so thoughtfully and constructively\ninitiated by the Secretary-General last year.\nThe study seeks to do three things in particular. First,\nit suggests ways of bringing a little more clarity - to the\nextent this is presently lacking - into the concepts and\nvocabulary that we use in defining security problems,\ndefining possible responses and matching responses to\nproblems. Secondly, it suggests specific criteria that might\nbe applied by decision-makers in deciding what, if any,\nresponse is appropriate to a particular new security problem.\nAnd, thirdly, it suggests a priority list of areas in which\nfurther United Nations reform might usefully be pursued. In\nthe short time that remains to me I shall try to give a quick,\noutline sketch of what we are trying to say in each of these\nrespects.\nFirst of all, on the issue of concepts and terminology,\nit is perhaps worth making the point at the outset that this is\nnot just something for academics to wrangle about. It\nmatters in practice. If decision-makers do not share the\nsame basic way of looking at issues and the same basic\nvocabulary in defining them, there is a very real risk that\nthey will talk past each other - or, at the very least, find it\nvery much harder to produce responses which are timely,\nproperly graduated, effective in practice, affordable and\nbroadly consistent from one case to the next.\nJust as importantly, the choice of words can sometimes\nsignificantly influence the way in which we think about\nmatters of substance. To give just one example: If we use,\nas many people still do, the expression \\\"peace-making\\\" to\ndescribe military enforcement action, then, simply because\nthis is such an innocuous and constructive sounding\nexpression, there is a danger that we may over time become\na little more relaxed than we should be about taking such\naction. It is much better, I suggest, to confine the expression\n\\\"peace-making\\\" to diplomatic-type activity to resolve conflict\nand to reserve the expression \\\"peace enforcement\\\" to\ndescribe the always dangerous, always messy, and what\nshould always be the last-resort, activity of applying military\nforce.\nIn the study we define security problems, in more or\nless escalating order of seriousness, as \\\"emerging threats\\\",\n\\\"disputes\\\", \\\"armed conflicts\\\" and \\\"other major security\ncrises.\\\" We make the point that security is not strictly or\nsolely a military concept and that threats to security, as\nmany speakers in the general debate have already said, can\nthese days come very much from factors such as exploding\npopulation pressures, environmental degradation, mass\ninvoluntary movements of people and the illicit narcotics\ntrade, among other things.\nEqually, we define possible responses to security\nproblems, again in escalating order of severity, in terms of\n\\\"peace- building,\\\" \\\"preventive diplomacy,\\\" \\\"preventive\ndeployment,\\\" \\\"peace- making,\\\" \\\"peace-keeping,\\\" \\\"sanctions\\\"\nand \\\"peace enforcement.\\\" We are at pains to emphasize that\nit is only as a last resort that security solutions should be\nseen as coming out of the barrel of a gun. We give much\nmore emphasis than has been common elsewhere to the\nconcept of \\\"peace-building,\\\" which we define in the study as\nextending not just to post-conflict economic development\nand institution-building strategies, but to a whole variety of\npreventive strategies, both within particular countries and in\nthe form of international treaty-type r\u00e9gimes addressing both\nmilitary and non-military threats to security.\nIn defining criteria for embarking on peace operations -\nwhether peace-keeping or peace enforcement - the most\ncrucial consideration is that there be a clearminded focus on\nthe objectives of the exercise and the likely effectiveness of\nthe operation in achieving those objectives. No operations\nof this kind should ever be embarked upon for the sake of\nbeing seen to be doing something. Although it is not always\npossible to analyse or predict with certainty, it should always\nbe possible to avoid embarking on operations which are\nmanifestly likely to be ineffective and which, as such, put at\nrisk the most crucial United Nations resource of all, its\ncredibility.\nIn the case of peace-keeping we suggest in Cooperating\nfor Peace that there are seven basic conditions for ensuring\nan effective operation: clear and achievable goals; adequate\nresources; close coordination of peace-keeping with any\nongoing peacemaking activity; a capacity to be and to be\nseen to be absolutely impartial as between the parties who\nhave been in conflict; a significant degree of local support\nfor the peace-keepers; evident support for the operation from\nexternal Powers that may have been involved previously in\nsupporting one side or the other; and a \\\"signposted exit\\\",\nthat is, a clearly designated termination point, or set of\ntermination criteria.\nWhen it comes to peace-enforcement operations, our\nsuggested criteria for determining involvement are quite\ncomplex and vary according to whether one is talking about\nan operation in response to cross-border aggression, as with\nIraq and Kuwait; about one in support of peace-keeping\noperations, the basic rationale for United Nations\ninvolvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina; or about peace\nenforcement in support of humanitarian objectives, as in\nSomalia. Without going into all the necessary detail now, I\nthink the basic considerations always come down to the\nfollowing: widespread international support; clear and\nachievable goals; adequate total resources to meet those\ngoals; and clearly defined termination or review points.\nIf the United Nations is to play with maximum\neffectiveness the central role it needs to play in maintaining\ninternational peace and security, then further change, further\nreform in the United Nations system, really is necessary.\nSome of that change is bound to be painful for some people,\nbut that is the way of change. Putting it simply and starkly:\nUnless the United Nations develops a comprehensive\ncapacity to address today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s problems - not\nyesterday\u2019s - there is a very real risk of the United Nations\ngradually losing, with Governments and peoples around the\nworld, the credibility it needs to survive.\nIn the study we identify a number of priority areas for\nchange. The first is to restructure the Secretariat to ensure\nthat the Secretary-General has an effective chain of\ncommand exercising authority over major United Nations\noperations and to consolidate and coordinate in a more\norderly and manageable way the present sprawl of\ndepartments and agencies. We support the proposal that the\nSecretary-General create a new senior structure at United\nNations Headquarters under which he would have four\nDeputy Secretaries-General responsible, respectively, for\npeace and security, economic and social operations,\nhumanitarian operations and administration and management.\nEach such Deputy Secretary-General would have full\nexecutive responsibility for the operational issues falling\nwithin his or her portfolio, subject only to direction by the\nSecretary-General. This would be a big change, and it is not\nthe first time it has been proposed, but it is the one that,\nmore than anything else, would create the conditions for\nmore orderly and effective management throughout the\nUnited Nations system.\nThe second priority need is to resolve once and for all\nthe United Nations critical funding problem. Various\nadventurous ideas have been canvassed for external\nfunding - money coming from sources other than Member\nStates - and we suggest that at least one of those ideas,\nnamely, a small levy on international airline travel, be\nfurther explored. But overwhelmingly, of course, the\nproblem is one that has been created by Member States,\nincluding the richest of our number, and it is entirely within\nour ability to resolve by meeting our assessed contributions\nfor regular budgets and peace operations in full and on time.\nIt is an abuse of good management principles and of basic\ncommon sense to be forcing the Secretary-General to spend\nso much of his time pleading for debts to be honoured. In\nthat respect I echo the sentiments expressed a few minutes\nago by Mrs. Brundtland.\nIf the bulk of current arrears were to be paid by the end\nof this year, the United Nations finances would be in a quite\nhealthy position, with the Working Capital Fund, the Peace-\nkeeping Reserve Fund and the Special Account all\nreplenished and the Organization in a position to meet all\noutstanding troop-contribution costs.\nThe third priority is to improve the management of\npeace operations, both at Headquarters and in the field.\nSome very significant and useful steps have already been\ntaken in this regard in the context of the creation of the new\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations, but more remains\nto be done, including in particular the development over time\nof a properly constituted General Staff to plan and manage\nthe military dimensions of such operations.\nThe fourth priority is to give special attention to the\nmachinery of preventive diplomacy, again both at\nHeadquarters and in the field. These efforts have been\nlargely ad hoc in the past, although the Department of\nPolitical Affairs is gradually building a core of appropriate\nexpertise. Quite apart from anything else, there is an\noverwhelming cost advantage in doing more to stop disputes\nbecoming armed conflicts. We estimate the cost of keeping\n100 well-qualified, experienced practitioners of preventive\ndiplomacy in the field for a year to be $21 million; compare\nthat with this year\u2019s peace operations budget of $3.7 billion -\nand compare it, moreover, with the $70 billion that it is\nestimated to have cost the United Nations coalition to fight\nthe six-week Gulf war.\nThe fifth priority is to rethink the whole system of\nhumanitarian relief coordination. Despite advances that have\nbeen made with the creation of the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs, we think some basic structural\nproblems remain. We propose that they be addressed in a\nradical way by the creation of a new disaster-response\nagency, combining the relief and basic rehabilitation\nfunctions of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme\n(WFP), which would work in turn directly to the suggested\nDeputy Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.\nThe sixth priority, as we see it, is to take various steps\nto raise the profile within the United Nations system of\npeace-building. This is, after all, the point of intersection\nbetween the Organization\u2019s peace and security role and its\neconomic and social role, and it should be given recognition\nand emphasis as such. The pursuit of peace and security has\nto include the satisfaction of basic human needs, as well as\nthe direct prevention, containment and settlement of armed\nconflict. Much of the United Nations system is in fact\nalready concerned with peace- building in the form of\nactivities such as international law-making, disarmament,\neconomic and social advancement, sustainable development,\ndemocratization and institution building. But much more\ncan be done, organizationally, to link these activities\ntogether, to recognize their security significance, and to\nensure that they are pursued with a sense of common\npurpose.\nThe remaining priority, a very large subject in itself, as\nwe all know, is to regenerate the Security Council - not\nbecause it is now working ineffectively, but because its\nmanifest lack of representativeness is beginning to impact\nupon its legitimacy. The Security Council is the linchpin of\nthe whole United Nations peace and security system, and it\nis in no one\u2019s interest that its credibility should be allowed\nto gradually erode. The outstanding questions about the size\nand shape of the Council should certainly be resolved by the\ntime of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary in 1995.\nThis, indeed, remains an ideal target date for the\nachievement of a whole range of necessary organizational\nreforms.\nRunning right through the study - and underlying all the\nsuggestions we have been making about structure and\nprocess - is a single sustaining idea, that of cooperative\nsecurity. This embraces two perhaps rather more familiar\nideas, common security and collective security. But the\noverall flavour of cooperative security can perhaps best be\ncaptured by describing it, in a little more detail, as an\napproach that emphasizes reassurance rather than deterrence;\nthat is inclusive rather than exclusive; that favours\nmultilateralism over unilateralism or bilateralism; that does\nnot rank military solutions over non-military ones; that\nassumes that States are the principal actors in the security\nsystem, but also accepts that non-State actors have an\nimportant role to play; that does not particularly emphasize\nthe creation of formal security institutions but does not reject\nthem either; and that above all stresses the value of creating\nhabits of dialogue.\nA good deal of the spirit of cooperative security is in\nfact to be found in the Charter of the United Nations.\nParagraph 4 of Article 1, a provision much neglected in the\npast, designates the United Nations as a \\\"centre for\nharmonizing the actions of nations\\\" - not the sentiments of\nnations, but the actions of nations. In Articles 55 and 56\nMember States pledge themselves to create the\n\\\"conditions of stability and well-being which are\nnecessary for peaceful and friendly relations among\nnations\\\".\nUnderscored in that context are the promotion of higher\nstandards of living, the solution of economic and social\nproblems and respect for human rights.\nToo often during the cold war we looked past these\nobligations and concerns, because we were preoccupied with\nmilitary means of survival. But the threats that concerned us\nthen no longer exist; and what was written in San Francisco,\nbefore the cold war froze our capacity to deal with many\nother kinds of threats to security, should now be seen as a\ncompelling guide.\nOur survival in the 1990s and beyond will depend on\nour developing a new understanding of what constitutes\nsecurity and what contributes to it. It will depend on our\ncapacity to think clearly about how to react to new security\nproblems as they arise. It will depend on our willingness to\nrethink and to reshape our institutions, including the United\nNations, so that they can cope with new realities. But,\nabove all, it will depend on our all developing and sustaining\na real commitment to cooperating for peace.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, please\nconvey to His Excellency, Ambassador Insanally, my\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-\neighth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held at a\npoint in time in which the United Nations is being asked to\nplay a constructive role in many fields. The onerous task of\nhelping to respond to this challenge rests on his capable\nshoulders. I should like to wish him every success in his\ntask and I pledge the full support of the delegation of the\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe world is balancing between great hope and\nimmense suffering. Walls have tumbled not only in Europe.\nIn the Middle East two courageous leaders, Prime Minister\nRabin and Chairman Arafat, have set out on the road to\nreconciliation between their people. In South Africa\nMr. Mandela and President De Klerk showed similar courage\nin breaking with the past and ushering in a new democratic\nSouth Africa. At the same time, we see violence of many\nkinds raking the face of the Earth. From Angola to Bosnia\nvillages are being destroyed and innocent people are\nslaughtered in cold blood.\nThe future of Russia as well is crucial to our hopes. A\ndemocratic Russia at peace with itself and its neighbours is\na major element of international stability. In Russia, too, we\nsee a courageous statesman trying to break with the past:\nPresident Boris Yeltsin. I join many others in expressing my\nfull support for his efforts to consolidate democracy in\nRussia.\nThe end of the cold war created a historic opportunity\nto shape a more just and peaceful world. History will judge\nus severely if we let this opportunity slip through our hands.\nStrengthening international peace and security involves\na broad range of efforts. It is now widely recognized that\n\\\"security\\\" cannot be viewed in military or political-military\nterms alone. A broader definition is called for. Indeed, last\nyear\u2019s summit meeting of the Security Council emphasized\nthat non-military sources of instability in the economic,\nsocial, humanitarian and ecological fields can be threats to\npeace and security as well. The traditional distinction\nbetween conflicts between States and conflicts within States\nis also becoming blurred. Bloodshed within a State tends,\nsooner or later, to spill across national borders. This, of\ncourse, raises the issue of sovereignty. How do we define\nsovereignty at a time of increasing interdependence and\nincreasing mutual vulnerability? Sovereignty is certainly an\nimportant principle of international law. But this principle\ncan never have been intended to shield from the outside\nworld dictators who massacre their own people. Nor can it\nbe intended to allow the perpetuation of large-scale suffering\nand death in a State that has collapsed into anarchy. At\ntimes the international community can indeed have a moral\nduty to intervene. And at times it can be necessary for the\nUnited Nations to take over the de facto exercise of\nsovereignty in such a shattered State to allow it to be rebuilt.\nWe must hope that this will succeed in Somalia. We can\ntake heart from current developments in Cambodia, which\nprove that such ambitious ventures can succeed.\nA number of recent resolutions of the Security Council\nhave broken new ground by extending international\nresponsibility to encompass the plight of individual countries\nsuch as Somalia and Bosnia. Thus the definition of what\nconstitutes a threat to international peace and security has\ngradually been widened.\nIn his recent speech in Quebec, Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali discussed the issue of \\\"conflict\nsituations within nations\\\". He said:\n\\\"It is these new conflicts which are most\nthreatening to international peace today and which\nare most damaging to the rights of individuals\\\".\nOn that occasion the Secretary-General called for \\\"a\nnew diplomacy for democracy and human rights\\\". I believe\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthat this idea is a valuable addition to our \\\"Agenda for\nPeace\\\".\nLet me mention here the United Nations Conference on\nHuman Rights, which opened up new possibilities for\nimproving the protection of human rights. After a difficult\nstart, the outcome of the Conference was certainly gratifying.\nThe Final Document contains important recommendations\nfor further steps, which should now be implemented.\nThus, the Kingdom of the Netherlands would like to\nunderscore the urgent appeal of the Conference to the\nSecretary-General and the General Assembly to increase\ndrastically the funding of the United Nations Centre for\nHuman Rights. It is of crucial importance that in the course\nof this session of the General Assembly the post of high\ncommissioner for human rights be created, and the broad\noutline of the mandate established. This session will also\nprovide us with an opportunity to tackle one of the most\nheinous categories of human rights violations - that of grave\nwar crimes - through the establishment of the International\nWar Crimes Tribunal. The Kingdom of the Netherlands,\nwith its rich tradition in the field of international law, is\nproud to have been asked to host the Tribunal in The Hague.\nThe increasing responsibilities that the United Nations\nis called upon to shoulder emphasize the twin requirements\nof legitimacy and effectiveness. This brings us to the heart\nof the debate on enlargement of the Security Council.\nClearly, we must be careful not to jeopardize the\ndecision-making ability of the Security Council by making\nit unwieldy. However, I would favor extension of the\nCouncil by the inclusion of a few major countries, provided\nthat they were willing and able to carry the share of\ncollective responsibility that went with their membership.\nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" invites us to take a broader\nview of the task of maintaining peace and security. It\nrightly stresses the need for early warning and early action\nwith regard to a crisis; or - even better - preventive action.\nDevelopments in the former Yugoslavia and in other trouble\nspots of the world have once again confirmed that the longer\na crisis is allowed to fester, the more difficult it is to bring\nit under control, and the higher the cost of such action.\nI believe that, in this light, we should try to rethink the\ninterrelationship of the various instruments of crisis\nmanagement. Diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions and\nmilitary pressure should not necessarily be viewed as\nsequential but, rather, as an integrated set of instruments.\nPeacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building\nrequire the full range of United Nations instruments,\nincluding those of the humanitarian and socio-economic\nsectors.\nThe enormous increase in the number and scope of\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations confronts us all\nwith a daunting task. Moreover, in many cases the\nenvironment in which these operations take place has\nchanged: whereas, previously, peace-keeping operations\ntended to be conducted in a benign environment, where all\nparties benefited from the implementation of a limited\nmandate, now peace-keepers often operate in a hostile\nclimate, where one or more parties frown upon the United\nNations presence and the Organization\u2019s mandate. This\nmeans that many operations these days are fraught literally\nwith physical danger for United Nations personnel - civilian\nas well as military - and that privileges and immunities are\noften violated. No longer does the blue flag automatically\ncommand respect, and this directly affects the credibility of\nthe United Nations. Consequently, mandates now tend to be\nstronger than before, and often they are explicitly based\nupon Chapter VII of the Charter.\nThe changing character of peace-keeping operations\nrequires personnel with different qualifications. Well-trained\nsoldiers used to be able to do the job; today we require also\nspecialized units in the field of logistics, staff officers with\nexperience in multinational operations, mine-clearing experts,\nand so on. On the civilian side, police officers, electoral\nexperts, administrators and human-rights specialists are\nindispensable for integrated operations.\nIncreasing recourse to the United Nations, particularly\nwhen it comes to initiating peace operations, is pushing the\nUnited Nations to the limits of its organizational and\nfinancial resources. This means that in the future the United\nNations will have to rely more on regional organizations and\nstructures to carry out peace operations and other missions.\nThe Charter makes provision for this, and the\nSecretary-General has advanced a similar proposal in his\n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". On one hand, this will relieve the\nUnited Nations of some of its commitments; on the other, it\nwill enable regional organizations or structures with greater\nfirst-hand knowledge of the conflicts in their parts of the\nworld to contribute more effectively to resolution of the\nunderlying problems.\nThere are no standard formulas which dictate how these\ninterlocking institutions should interact, and each case will\nhave to be looked at individually to determine which form\nof cooperation is most suitable.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands has consistently\nendeavoured to make a high-grade contribution to effective\npeace operations, to which we feel committed as a Member\nof the United Nations. The present reorganization of the\nNetherlands armed forces is specifically geared to enabling\nour country to participate even more broadly, speedily and\neffectively in future peace-keeping operations.\nThe Netherlands believes that adequate preparation and\nefficient supervision are crucial to the success of peace\noperations and has accordingly made a number of military\nofficials available to the United Nations.\nAs peace operations increase in number and scope, so\ndoes the need for support from the Secretariat. The\nSecretariat should be able to expand - and to contract - in\nproportion to the need for peace-keeping tasks. Whenever\nexpansion is required it should take place at an early stage.\nThe preparation, planning and budgeting that precede the\nactual operation are precisely the elements that are essential\nto its success. The budgets currently proposed to the\nGeneral Assembly for setting up new peace operations are\ninadequate. This not only makes it difficult for the Member\nStates to reach decisions on the funding of operations, but\nalso indicates that, at the time the budgets are presented,\nthere is no complete picture of the way the operation is to be\nset up. Obviously, if the number of peace operations\ndecreases, the additional staff at the Secretariat will also no\nlonger be necessary. What I am suggesting here is that any\nreinforcement be temporary, flexible and prompt.\nApart from proper planning and training, adequate\nstaffing and a satisfactory level of supervision - all of which\nare indispensable to the success of a peace operation - it is\nimportant that United Nations peace forces be on the spot as\nsoon as possible after the decision to deploy them has been\nmade. Otherwise, there is a danger that hostilities will be\nresumed and thus that the basis for successful\nimplementation of the Security Council mandate will have\ndisappeared before the forces are in position. Speed is\ntherefore of the essence if the use of greater force is to be\navoided.\nThis is possible only if there is a clear picture of the\nforces that can be made available to the United Nations at\nshort notice. In this connection, the Netherlands welcomes\nthe formation of the stand-by forces planning team, which is\nengaged in formulating a concept and drawing up an\ninventory of rapid deployment forces. The Netherlands has\nundertaken to communicate by the end of 1993 which Dutch\nunits could be eligible for designation as stand-by forces.\nThe final decision concerning possible deployment of troops\nwill of course always rest with the Netherlands Government.\nThe growing demands on the United Nations system\ncan be met only if standards of management, administration\nand accountability are high. The responsibility for\ndetermining and maintaining these standards lies first and\nforemost with ourselves as Member States. It is our\nresponsibility to indicate clear priorities, to ensure\nconsistency in the decisions taken by different United\nNations commissions and governing bodies, and to provide\nthe financial resources required to meet agreed priorities.\nMuch criticism levelled against the Organization\nindicates a genuine need to improve the functioning and\nmanagement of the Secretariat. Part of this criticism has its\nroots in the way Member States discharge their\nresponsibilities: the failure of Governments to set priorities,\nthe adoption of resolutions with unclear objectives and the\nfailure to pay assessed contributions cannot be blamed on\nthe Secretariat.\nI am convinced that the vast majority of United Nations\nstaff members are dedicated and loyal international civil\nservants. We owe them our respect. In areas ranging from\nthe direct provision of health care to non-proliferation of\nnuclear weapons, many of them work under difficult\nconditions, some even risking their lives.\nBut despite the quality and commitment of its staff, the\nSecretariat should take a long hard look at its own\nmanagement structure. Key phrases such as management by\nobjectives, transparency and accountability must become\nhousehold words in United Nations vocabulary. Line\nmanagers must be given greater responsibility and should be\nheld accountable for the attainment of predetermined\nobjectives.\nMoreover, the Secretariat should respond to criticism in\na more satisfactory manner: first of all, by ensuring that\njustified criticism is acted upon and that corrective measures\nare taken without delay; and, secondly, by promptly refuting\nfalse allegations. In short, the public relations of the United\nNations need improvement.\nThe Secretary-General has taken several commendable\ninitiatives to restructure the Secretariat. The first changes\nwere introduced in the political sectors, and this year the\nsocial and economic sectors were reorganized. This\nrestructuring has provided a solid basis for improving\neffectiveness and coordination. But further measures are\nrequired. It is important to maintain the momentum and to\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nprovide clear perspectives for United Nations staff members:\nthey should not be kept in the dark about their future status\nand about the direction of reform. Lingering uncertainty has\naffected staff morale and thus staff effectiveness.\nI have already said that Member States have a\nresponsibility to provide financial resources for agreed\npriorities and mandated activities. The United Nations\ncannot be run on a shoestring. Year after year the\nOrganization suffers from long delays in the receipt of\nassessed contributions. As a result, mandated activities can\nbe implemented only in part or after substantial delay. In\nthe area of peace-keeping, troop contributors unfortunately\nhave to be prepared and able to provide long-term advance\nfinancing for peace-keeping operations.\nThis lack of discipline among Member States forces the\nSecretariat to spend a great deal of energy attempting to\nsolve incessant liquidity problems. The painful paradox is\nthat the Secretariat\u2019s relative success at shoestring budgeting\nseems to contribute to a further deterioration in payment\ndiscipline among Member States. Moreover, the burden of\nkeeping the United Nations in business now lies unfairly\nwith those Member States who make their payments\npromptly and in full.\nA number of Member States appear to make partial\npayments as an expression of their dissatisfaction with\ncertain aspects of the Organization\u2019s work. The United\nNations does not serve an \u00e0 la carte menu: dissatisfaction\nshould be voiced in debate and by force of argument, not by\nwithholding assessed contributions.\nWe shall be considering the recommendations of the\nVolcker-Ogata report on the financing of the United Nations\nsystem during this session. The merits of many of the\nrecommendations are obvious, but generally speaking they\ncan only help to alleviate the immediate problems; they do\nnot go to the heart of the matter. Ultimately, the only\nsolution to the Organization\u2019s financial problems - and this\ncannot be stated often enough - is prompt and full payment\nof assessed contributions by all Member States.\nWhile we insist that Member States meet their financial\nobligations, we also expect the Secretariat to use its financial\nresources in an efficient and effective manner. Some\nMember States have suggested the establishment of new\nfinancial control mechanisms. These proposals may have\nmerits, but we should not lose sight of the fact that a number\nof control mechanisms already exist. I believe that a critical\nreview of the functioning of the present mechanisms is in\norder before we decide upon new structures.\nBut auditing alone is insufficient. The structure of the\nOrganization must be such that financial and administrative\nmismanagement is prevented. Line managers, for example,\nmust be held accountable for budgets under their control. In\nrecent years the Netherlands delegation has presented several\nideas aimed at the improvement of the management of\nUnited Nations programmes, and these have subsequently\nbeen adopted by the General Assembly.\nIn addition, I advocate greater cost-awareness, not only\namong United Nations staff but also, and especially, among\nMember States. It is relatively simple to request the\nSecretary-General to undertake new activities, call additional\nmeetings or produce reports on a variety of issues. But we\nmust ask ourselves each time whether these requests meet a\nreal need, as they compete for strained financial and staff\nresources.\nAlthough the resources of the United Nations are\nlimited, genuine priorities must be met. In this respect, at\nthis session the General Assembly will face a particularly\ndifficult task. It will have to determine which activities will\nreceive priority under the regular budget for 1994 and 1995.\nAs new priorities emerge, a number of activities will have to\nbe reduced or even eliminated altogether. We have to live\nwithin our means. The Netherlands believes that additional\nresources are needed most to strengthen the capacity of the\nUnited Nations in the area of human rights, to improve the\nSecretariat\u2019s capacity to plan and manage peace-keeping\nactivities and to ensure the effective coordination of\nhumanitarian and emergency operations.\nSo far I have addressed a number of conditions that\nwill have to be fulfilled if the United Nations is to respond\neffectively to the new challenges confronting it. A sound\nfinancial basis, effective management and the availability of\nqualified personnel, both at the Secretariat and in the context\nof peace operations in the field, are the material\nrequirements which must be met. However, no less crucial\nis the determination actually to implement the resolutions\nadopted by the Security Council. Decision-making in the\nCouncil should reflect the combined political will of its\nmembers - acting on behalf of the United Nations Member\nStates - actually to translate their words into action where\nnecessary, once the material conditions have been fulfilled.\nToo often in the recent past, there has been a failure to take\ndecisive action despite a declared willingness to do so when\nsuch action was both necessary and justified.\nIrrespective of the detrimental effect this can have on\npeace operations themselves, it can also cause irreparable\ndamage in the long term to the standing and credibility of\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25\nthe United Nations as a whole. Let me be clear about this:\nI am not advocating resort to military action at the drop of\na hat. But if the Security Council draws a line and says that\nif the line is crossed military action will be taken, it must be\nprepared to fulfil this pledge. If such a course proves\nimpossible, then the mandate was not adequately tailored to\nthe situation. If, on the other hand, the mandate is adequate\nbut the Council lacks the will to carry it out, its apparent\ndetermination is nothing but an empty threat. Either way,\nthe credibility of the Organization is dealt a severe blow. If\nthis occurs too often, we run the risk that the new decisive\nUnited Nations of the post-cold-war era will become a paper\ntiger, making decisions that it cannot or will not put into\npractice. This must not be allowed to happen.\nNow, more than ever, we need a decisive United\nNations and a firm commitment on the part of the Member\nStates. The United Nations needs Member States that pay\ntheir dues, provide the Organization with the necessary\nhuman resources and have the political will to carry out the\ndecisions which they have collectively arrived at. The\nMember States need a United Nations which is able to\nperform those tasks, which operates efficiently and\neffectively and which can be made accountable for the\nresources entrusted to it. It is the wish of the Kingdom of\nthe Netherlands that this forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly will bring us closer to achieving these aims.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government and people of Togo, I should\nlike to convey very sincere condolences and feelings of\ncompassion to the people and the Government of India, who\nhave been so harshly afflicted by a cruel catastrophe.\nAllow me first of all to discharge the pleasant duty of\nexpressing to you, Mr. President, the warm congratulations\nof the Togo delegation on the unanimous confidence that has\nbeen invested in you by dint of your assumption of the lofty\nand noble task of conducting the debates of the current\nsession. You can count on my delegation\u2019s full cooperation\nin the performance of the weighty responsibilities that fall to\nyou.\nMy delegation also congratulates the outgoing\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who with great\nmastery and skill led the work of the forty-seventh session\nto success.\nTo our Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I also wish to pay a well-\ndeserved tribute for the remarkable work he has been\ncarrying out since his election to the head of our\nOrganization. I should also like to reiterate to him our very\nsincere gratitude for his constant and tireless efforts to\nenhance the effectiveness of the Organization, particularly in\nthe field of peace-keeping and the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. The firm determination he\nhas displayed in the restructuring of the United Nations to\nbetter adapt it to present-day realities has also won our\nadmiration.\nOur Organization is growing steadily, bringing us ever\ncloser to the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter of\nSan Francisco. Togo bids welcome to the new Members\nthat have joined the Organization this year, and we express\nto them our willingness to work in concert with them in\nbuilding a world of greater justice and solidarity.\nThe prevailing situation in the world today does not live\nup to the expectations engendered by the changes that\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 25\ntook place at the beginning of this decade. The hope of\nuniversal renewal characterized by the building of a world\nof peace, prosperity and justice, marked by reliable solidarity\nand more active cooperation among nations, has been slow\nin taking concrete form.\nThe grim picture seen in the tragedies unfolding before\nour eyes in Somalia, Liberia, Angola, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and elsewhere, as well as the persistence of the\ninternational economic crisis, leads one to believe that the\nfuture of the world is not as rosy as we had hoped. The\nnew order is still rather nebulous.\nNevertheless, we welcome the growing involvement of\nthe Organization in settling the various crises facing the\nworld. This bears witness to its new vitality and reflects the\ngrowing confidence that Member States place in multilateral\ncooperation.\nA year ago we noted from this same rostrum the\nupheavals that had occurred in recent years throughout the\nworld, particularly in Europe, Asia and Africa. Those signs\nof the times were then said to exemplify the determination\nof peoples to gain more freedom and full participation in the\nmanagement of political affairs.\nToday, more than ever before, those peoples are still\nsearching for that era of freedom, peace and justice that only\ndemocracy, stripped of all disguise and based on clearly\nunderstood and assimilated multi-party systems, can provide\nthem, with the support of the international community,\nthough without the need to yield to the temptation of\nimposing a uniform model.\nThis emancipation movement, to which the African\npeoples did not hesitate to adhere, has met with different\nfortunes in its various manifestations. While in certain\ncountries the transition towards democracy has unfolded\nsomewhat smoothly and has made it possible to bring about\ngenuine changes, in others the process has hardly achieved\nthe objectives so earnestly desired. This is true in some\ncountries of the African continent that, because of a lack of\nunderstanding between the various players, face enormous\ndifficulties that rend the fabric of society. Because of this\nlack of understanding, the aspiration of the African peoples\nto more freedom and democracy, though a legitimate one,\nhas unfortunately given rise here and there to a new type of\nproblem, on top of the continent\u2019s usual troubles.\nIt is unfortunate that my country, Togo, has surely paid\na heavier price than others in the ineluctable march towards\ndemocratization. Indeed, no one can know the pain and\nsorrow of our people\u2019s path in its progress towards\ndemocracy. Many difficulties arising from serious\nmisunderstandings between the players in national political\nlife regarding what democratization involves have dealt a\nheavy blow to the democratic process, which we had all\nhoped with all our hearts would be a peaceful one. This has\nled to a rare outbreak of political violence, which has\nravaged the whole of the national territory, unleashed serious\ndisruptions in the nation and displaced populations.\nIn the face of this worrisome situation that was\nthreatening national cohesion, the Government, anxious to do\neverything it could to bring the transition to culmination as\nquickly as possible, has made numerous efforts to find a\nsolution to the political crisis in which our country was\nplunged. In this spirit, it has done everything it can to\ncombat violence and insecurity by deploying the public\nsecurity forces in order to ensure, throughout the territory,\nthe peace and order that are indispensable for the free\nmovement of peoples and goods and the proper conduct of\nsocial, economic and political activity before, during and\nafter the electoral consultations.\nHowever, I hardly think it necessary to go on at great\nlength on this situation, because we were offered the means\nof a solution, and we did not fail to seize it. Thus, the\npeople of Togo have regained the hope and calm they so\nneeded in order to regain their confidence.\nThe elections of last 25 August - which were held, by\nand large, in a calm and serene atmosphere and transparency\nand in the presence of international observers - allowed our\npeople democratically to appoint the first President of the\nFourth Togolese Republic. Re-elected with a large majority\nof the votes cast, the outgoing President, General Gnassingb\u00e9\nEyadema, set as his main task to work tirelessly, in full\nrespect of human rights, for national reconciliation and the\nrecovery of the country\u2019s economy, ruined by more than two\nyears of turbulent transition. He therefore called upon the\nsons of the nation to start with a clean slate, to forgive\nthemselves and unite in the struggle for the democratic\nprocess and the restoration of the country, in the interests of\nall. Certainly, some problems remain, but such problems are\ninherent to any apprenticeship. It is thus possible now to\nhope that Togo will be restored to its former health.\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn this connection, I am pleased to point out that, with\nregard to the forthcoming legislative elections, the\nGovernment has already taken steps to resolve all the\ntechnical problems connected with the organization of the\nelections so as to ensure that they are held in the greatest\npossible transparency. Aware that democracy requires the\ncooperation of all in the management of the polity\u2019s affairs,\nthe Government intends to spare no effort to ensure the\nopposition\u2019s participation in the forthcoming legislative\nelections.\nOur delegation should emphasize here the very useful\nrole played by friendly countries in the search for a\nsuccessful solution to the crisis in our country. I therefore\ntake the opportunity to thank from this rostrum all those\nwho, from near or far, contributed to our achievement of that\nresult. Our feelings of deep gratitude go out particularly to\nthe people, the Government and the Head of State of\nBurkina Faso, Mr. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who applied all their\ntalents to bring about that which, several months earlier, still\nseemed impossible: bring our Togolese brothers around a\nnegotiating table and lead them to reach agreement.\nI also wish to welcome the sustained action undertaken\nby France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United\nStates of America, whose mediation contributed to the\nfavourable outcome of the initiatives. My Government is\nparticularly grateful to the United Nations and to the\nOrganization of African Unity, whose observers in the field\nmade a very valuable contribution to the proper holding of\nthe elections of 25 August 1993. It is to be hoped that the\nresult of this process will be the restoration of national\ncohesion, allowing the Togolese henceforth to enjoy their\nrights fully and in all tranquillity, including their right to\nfundamental freedoms and to development.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\nVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, seems to have been an\neffort to produce international consensus on the further\npromotion, protection and defence of human rights. That\nmeeting enshrined the axiom, henceforth shared by all, that\ndevelopment, democracy and human rights form an\nindissociable triad.\nBut can we speak objectively of the effective enjoyment\nof human rights in the case of a population whose standards\nof living are below the necessary minimum? The rights to\nfood, education and adequate health care are in fact denied\nto the citizens of our developing countries, above all because\nof an unfavourable international economic situation. The\nfirst among human rights is the right to life - a decent life.\nTherefore, in the framework of promoting and protecting\nhuman rights, it is necessary to redouble efforts to help the\ndeveloping countries to assume their responsibility to\ncontribute to the full flowering of the individual.\nMy country, which is deeply devoted to respect for the\nhuman person and determined to build a State of law, has\nassumed as its own - by including them in its new\nConstitution, adopted by referendum on 27 September 1992 -\nthe fundamental principles of democracy and those linked\nto the protection and promotion of human rights. Once\nagain, I should like to affirm before this Assembly that Togo\nis firmly committed to all universal values encompassing the\nprotection and enjoyment of rights inherent to the human\nperson. It is thus with faith and conviction that I aver that\nthe difficulties of adapting national legislation to\ninternational norms and the various approaches available in\nno way detract from the duty of each State to contribute to\nthe tangible and irreversible progress of the cause of human\nrights throughout the world.\nThe end of the cold war and the disappearance of\nideological antagonisms have not yet made it possible to\nusher in the genuine era of peace to which the world aspired,\ndespite the encouraging prospects these changes seemed to\noffer. Indeed, narrow nationalism, religious fanaticism,\nethnic rivalry and hegemonism have resurfaced,\nunfortunately plunging certain parts of the world into\nturmoil.\nThus, in Africa, the situation remains disquieting\ndespite the praiseworthy efforts of the United Nations and\nthe Organization of African Unity to settle the conflicts\nravaging the continent. In Angola, it is unfortunate that war\npersists and continues to claim many victims, despite the\ninitiatives made to induce the belligerent brothers to lay\ndown their arms. I express the hope that both protagonists,\noverriding all other considerations, make as their main goals\nthe re-establishment of peace and the higher interests of the\nAngolan people, and renounce the use of force and find a\nfinal and negotiated solution to the conflict.\nIn South Africa, the positive progress achieved -\nparticularly the fixing of 27 April 1994 as the date for the\nholding of the first multiracial elections - clearly demonstrate\nthat the emergence of a democratic non-racial society in that\ncountry is near at hand. In that spirit, Togo welcomes the\nadoption in Cape Town on 23 September by the three houses\nof the South African Parliament of a bill instituting a\ntransitional executive council entrusted with helping and\ncontrolling governmental activities up to the elections.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 27\nHowever, the noteworthy progress made recently\ntowards the complete and final dismantling of the apartheid\nsystem has been unable to disguise the various acts of\nviolence, aggression, confrontation and assassination that\nhave become daily features of South African political and\nsocial life. This increased violence, inspired and cunningly\nmaintained by groupings opposed to change, should prompt\nthe international community to do all in its power to ensure\nthe irreversibility of the process under way.\nThe Togolese Government takes note with interest of\nthe appeal made on 24 September by the President of the\nAfrican National Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, for the\nlifting of economic sanctions against South Africa. It is our\nhope that this measure will help to accelerate the democratic\nprocess in that country.\nIn Somalia, the deployment of the United Nations\nOperation has made it possible to alleviate the suffering of\nthe population. My delegation, while welcoming the efforts\nof the United Nations to restore normal living conditions,\nexpresses its grave concern at the enormous loss of life\namong the civilian populations and the Blue Helmets alike.\nGiven the present delicate situation there, it is\nimportant, as the Security Council unanimously urged on 22\nSeptember, to redouble efforts to reach a political settlement.\nTo that end, we cannot overemphasize the need to do\neverything possible to fulfil the objectives of the United\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), namely, the\n\\\"facilitation of humanitarian assistance and the\nrestoration of law and order, and of national\nreconciliation in a free, democratic and sovereign\nSomalia ...\\\". (Security Council resolution 865 (1993),\npara. 4.)\nAs for Liberia and Rwanda, which have for a number\nof years been arenas of cruel, fratricidal upheavals, Togo is\npleased to see that, thanks to the courage, farsightedness and\ndetermination of the parties concerned, there are finally some\nindications of genuine prospects for a final settlement of\nthose conflicts through, respectively, the Cotonou and\nArusha Agreements.\nIn the case of Liberia, in particular, my delegation\nwelcomes the arrangements made by the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the\nUnited Nations for the implementation of the Agreement of\n25 July so that the people of Liberia can once again live in\npeace and security and set about rebuilding their country in\nregained national unity.\nIn that connection, we believe that the role to be played\nby the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia\n(UNOMIL), established by the Security Council on 22\nSeptember of this year, will be a very decisive one.\nWith regard to the situation in Western Sahara, Togo\nwelcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General as set forth in\nhis report of 28 July 1993 (S/26185) on that question and\nurges him to pursue dialogue with the parties to the conflict\nin order to achieve implementation of the United Nations\nsettlement plan.\nThere are other regions of the world in which conflicts\nalso demand our attention and call for further efforts on our\npart to come up with adequate solutions.\nIn the case of the Middle East and the Israeli-Arab\nconflict, Togo welcomes the signing of the agreement on\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and hails it as an important\nfirst step towards peace in the region. Today, that\nagreement and the one relating to Palestinian autonomy in\nthe Gaza Strip and Jericho are indications that things are\nfinally on the right track. My country is more than ever\nconvinced that only the final settlement of the Palestinian\nproblem can lead to peace in the region.\nTrue, there is still a long way to travel down the road\nto peace. In reaching that goal, the protagonists, both Arab\nand Israeli, need our material and moral support. The\nconsolidation of the process that has been set in motion\ndepends on the international community\u2019s ability to respond\neffectively and urgently to the economic and social\ndevelopment needs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for\nonly viable development can ensure lasting peace in the\nregion.\nAs for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I\nshould like, on behalf of the Togolese Government, to repeat\nhere our hope for the success of all the initiatives taken by\nall sides to end the tragedy in that country. No one in the\nworld can sleep peacefully in the knowledge of the anguish\nof the innocent victims of that conflict. To the protagonists\nwe say: Enough! Enough of dying! Be flexible, be\nreasonable.\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nFinally, with regard to Cambodia, Togo welcomes the\ninestimable peace-keeping efforts made by the United\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC),\nwhich made it possible for free and democratic elections in\nthat country, under United Nations auspices, to be held in\nMay 1993.\nThe various conflicts that beset the world are directly\nrelated to the arms race. All countries are in duty bound to\nincrease their efforts to halt that race. At stake are the\nsurvival of mankind and national, regional and international\npeace and security.\nGeneral and complete disarmament - genuine\ndisarmament - for which all mankind so ardently hopes,\nrequires a substantial contribution from all Member States\nand the creation of appropriate structures. In this\nconnection, the action of the United Nations in this area\nshould be stepped up in order that the objectives of\ndisarmament can be achieved. The mission of the Regional\nDisarmament Centres should be viewed in the same context.\nIt is essential that they be made more operational by\nproviding them with adequate human, material and financial\nresources to enable them fully to discharge their duties.\nThe effectiveness of our Organization obviously\ndepends on restructuring and revitalizing it. My delegation,\nwhile welcoming the efforts already exerted in this\nconnection, believes that a review of the Charter is an\nimperative need in order to enable all the organs of the\nUnited Nations to participate fully in the implementation of\nits purposes and principles.\nThe time has come for the Organization to hew more\nclosely to the spirit of the Charter. My delegation therefore\nwarmly welcomes the proposals that there should be a\nrethinking of the membership of the Security Council with\na view to its expansion. In that endeavour it is important\nthat serious consideration be given to equitable geographical\nrepresentation of various regions so as to endow the\nuniversal Organization with a broader international consensus\nthat would provide a solid basis for its actions and make it\nmore dynamic, more active and more efficient.\nAs far as relations between States are concerned, the\nGovernment of Togo, in keeping with its policy of openness,\ndialogue and concerted action, firmly adheres to the\nprinciples of non-interference in the internal affairs of States\nand the non-use of force. Furthermore, we believe that,\ngiven the present state of international relations, the\nOrganization should help its Members to create domestic\nconditions that can contribute to the elimination of tensions\ncapable of leading to war either within or between States.\nIt was in that spirit that we welcomed last year the\nhighly pertinent recommendations formulated by the\nSecretary-General in his report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\",\nwhich were aimed at the maintenance and restoration of\ninternational peace and security. Today more than ever\nbefore, the United Nations must strengthen its capacity to\nmaintain and preserve that peace and security, to ensure\nrespect for human rights and to promote economic and social\nprogress.\nThe economic and social gap between rich and poor\ncountries is growing wider by the day, and the economies of\nthe developing countries, particularly the least developed\namong them, are prey to chronic recession.\nIn Africa the situation is even more tragic. The peoples\nof Africa, already the victims of undernourishment, famine\nand all kinds of other ills, are also bearing the full brunt of\nthe constant decrease in export prices, the continuous\ndeterioration of terms of trade, the obstacles imposed on\ntrade, and the burden of indebtedness.\nIn the area of international trade, relationships are ruled\nby the law of the jungle. The persistence of protectionism\nand the adoption of Draconian measures against exports\nfrom developing countries continue to hamper the efforts\nthey are making to achieve growth through exports.\nIn the light of what I have just said, it is urgent for the\ninternational economic environment to be improved by\ndesigning a more open and transparent trading system. The\nsystem will have to protect and support the trading\nrelationships of the third world countries with the\nindustrialized countries and, moreover, make it possible for\ncountries with weak economies to come away from the\nsidelines and be fully integrated into the world economy.\nMy Government therefore wishes trade liberalization to\nlead to the establishment of principles of fair play that would\nimpel the countries of the North to buy the South\u2019s products\nat remunerative prices. Towards this end, it is our hope that\nthe multilateral negotiations of the Uruguay Round will take\ninto account the concerns of the third world.\nThe debt problem remains a source of serious concern\nfor the African States, which are already being sorely tried\nby the effects of the world economic crisis. Africa, which\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 29\nis allocating more than half its income to servicing its debt,\nas required by the structural adjustment programmes, has\nbeen struggling for more than a decade now under an\neconomic shock therapy that leaves it no chance of success.\nUnfortunately, the many initiatives that have been taken to\npromote our countries\u2019 development have so far not had\npositive results, as most of them have been implemented\nonly half-heartedly. This is particularly true of the United\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\n1990s and the Paris Programme of Action for the Least\nDeveloped Countries for the 1990s.\nIn view of these considerations, my delegation would\nlike to recall that it is for the international community to\nadopt steps designed to alleviate the debt burden. These\nsteps should include, inter alia, writing off debt for\ndeveloping countries or, failing that, reducing it substantially,\nmaking repayment conditions more flexible, and setting up\nand paying into a diversification fund to transform the\ncommodities sector and stimulate economic growth in\nAfrica. There should also be a call for a considerable\nincrease in official development assistance.\nAs the 1980s were a lost decade for Africa, during the\n1990s the industrialized countries should agree to an increase\nin financial flows to the poorer countries sufficient to\nsupport their activities and programmes for development,\neconomic expansion and diversification, because it is a\nshame to see aid levels falling just when the African\ncountries are making major efforts to promote democracy\nand manage their economies in a sound and rigorous\nmanner. Of course, no one opts for democracy in the\nexpectation of preferential treatment, but particular attention\nshould be paid to our countries, which are already shaky as\na result of the general crisis that is rocking the world.\nAlthough we should stick to the rules of good economic\nmanagement, it would be a good thing if our countries,\nwhich are already in trouble, were not forced to submit to\nlong-drawn-out economic therapies that are quite likely to\nkill their efforts to become more democratic.\nSo, are we right to hope that the Tokyo Conference on\nAfrican development, which is going on right now, will\nmake it possible for us to drive it home to the major world\npolitical and economic players that there is a crying need to\nmake a massive, collective effort for African recovery,\nbecause Africa\u2019s economy has fallen into wrack and ruin?\nForty-eight years after the Second World War, the world,\nwhich is still characterized by an attitude, on the part of the\nstrong, of moral indifference and hardness of heart towards\nthe weak, is still living in fear of what the next day will\nbring.\nHowever, despite the tough political, economic and\nsocial realities that all mankind is facing, we all do feel the\ncommonality of our peoples\u2019 destiny and, without a doubt,\nthe relevance of the purpose and principles of our\nOrganization. Thus, we must turn the upheavals since the\nend of the cold war to advantage by building a new world\norder based on collective security on three levels - the\npolitical, the economic and the humanitarian - so as to bring\nabout better living conditions in greater liberty.\nTowards this end, the United Nations would gain by\nbeing reformed, made more democratic and revitalized in\norder to live up to its universal vocation and take up the\nmany challenges that a changing world is imposing on it.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish at the outset to extend\nto you, Sir, my congratulations on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Your\nelection reflects the Assembly\u2019s full confidence in you. My\ndelegation feels sure that we can count on your wide\nexperience and personal skills to guide our deliberations to\na fruitful conclusion. Allow me also to take this opportunity\nto express my delegation\u2019s appreciation to your predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for his tireless efforts to\nensure the success of the forty-seventh session.\nI am pleased to see among us delegations from the six\nnew Member States which joined the Organization this year.\nTheir presence in this Hall reflects the momentous changes\ntaking place in the world today and the growing confidence\nin the United Nations itself. My delegation feels that these\nnew Members, each with its own distinctive historical,\ncultural and political backgrounds, will have important\ncontributions to make to the Organization. My delegation\nwelcomes them all and looks forward to working with them.\nIt is an outstanding feature of our times that the\nnumber of sovereign States has increased and that the role\nof the Organization has grown enormously. There is today\na remarkable growth in the demand for the services of the\nUnited Nations. As noted by the Secretary-General, the\nOrganization has in the past four years become involved in\nas many peace-keeping operations as it had in the previous\nfour decades. The United Nations is increasingly called\nupon to pour oil on troubled waters. Its peace-keeping\nmissions are being carried out across the globe, from\nSomalia to Cambodia, and its agencies for development and\nhumanitarian affairs have fanned out even further afield. As\nthe United Nations assumes a more central role in the area\nof international security, it is essential that the Organization,\nin pursuit of the purposes stated in Article 1, act and be seen\nto act in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\nMyanmar would like to believe that in the post-cold-war era,\nStates will adhere strictly to the Charter\u2019s principles and\nmake concerted efforts to establish a workable system of\ncollective security. Just as the prohibition of the threat or\nuse of force against the territorial integrity or political\nindependence of any State is fundamental in inter-State\nrelations, the Charter unambiguously prohibits, in the\nwell-known paragraph 7 of Article 2, any intervention of the\nUnited Nations itself \\\"in matters which are essentially within\nthe domestic jurisdiction of any State\\\". This prohibition\napplies equally to States and to other international\norganizations. In this time of major political and economic\nchanges in a volatile world, extraordinary care should be\ntaken to uphold such basic principles as respect for the\nterritorial integrity or political independence of States.\nMyanmar fully supports the Security Council\u2019s\nrecommendation of 28 May 1993, which states that the\nCouncil considers that United Nations peace-keeping\noperations should be conducted in accordance with\noperational principles consistent with the provisions of the\nCharter of the United Nations. Those operational principles\ninclude a clear political goal with a precise mandate subject\nto periodic review and to change in its character or duration\nonly by the Council itself; the consent of the Government\nand, where appropriate the parties concerned, save in\nexceptional cases; support for a political process or for the\npeaceful settlement of the dispute; and impartiality in\nimplementing Security Council decisions.\nThe experience in Somalia underscores the need to\nadhere to those principles in all peace-keeping and\npeacemaking operations. In particular, it underscores the\nneed to exercise great prudence in sanctioning the use of\nforce in such operations and in its application on the ground.\nIt has also shown that peace-keeping operations cannot\nsucceed without the willing cooperation of all the parties\nconcerned.\nThe conscience of the world has been troubled by the\nhorror of the ongoing conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWhile it is true that the United Nations has taken some\naction in response to the crisis and that negotiations have\nbeen initiated in Geneva, much more needs to be done to\nstop the fighting and find a peaceful solution. The situation\nis complex but it must be realized that innocent men, women\nand children in the besieged towns and villages expect more\nof an international Organization whose principal purpose is\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. Unless\nappropriate actions are taken, the United Nations runs the\nrisk of being seen as protecting only certain countries or\ninterests.\nMy delegation is pleased to note that in Cambodia, the\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia has\nsuccessfully discharged its main responsibility of\nsupervising, monitoring and verifying the cease-fire and of\norganizing and conducting free and fair elections as\nscheduled, despite the decision of one of the Cambodian\nparties to stay away from the elections. The United Nations\nefforts to foster a democratic process and to bring back\npeace and stability to a country ravaged by two decades of\ncivil strife and war is an outstanding achievement. We\nshould like to take this opportunity to pay a warm and\nspecial tribute to Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, who handled a very\ndelicate situation with great prudence and tact. This\nachievement has made it possible for the people of\nCambodia to promulgate a new Constitution restoring the\nmonarchy and to form a broadly based Government. The\naccession to the throne of Cambodia by His Majesty King\nNorodom Sihanouk, a great patriot and statesman, is a\nhistoric event which augurs well for the rebuilding of a\npeaceful, unified and democratic Cambodia. As close\nneighbours, we look forward to peace and stability in\nCambodia and to working closely with the Government and\nthe people of Cambodia.\nThe effort to end apartheid in South Africa, sustained\nover decades, has produced positive results. The\nannouncement of an election date, 27 April 1994, for the\nfirst general elections in South Africa\u2019s history based on\nuniversal franchise is a significant achievement. The\nelections will provide the black majority the opportunity to\nshape its own destiny by participating in a process which it\nhad hitherto been denied. It is our hope that this will ensure\nthat the objective of the people of South Africa for a\ndemocratic, non-racial and united South Africa will be\nachieved. Much, however, remains to be done to maintain\nthe election timetable, and the next six months will be\ncritical in ending apartheid. We note that four pieces of\nlegislation - the Independent Electoral Commission, the\nIndependent Media Commission, the Independent\nBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional Executive\nCouncil - have been adopted by both the Negotiating\nCouncil and the South African Parliament. We hope that\nthese bodies will be established as soon as possible to guide\nthe country through the constitutional process.\nI am happy to note that the winds of change blowing\nacross our world have not left the Middle East untouched.\nThe historic agreement between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization on mutual recognition has\neffectively removed a major obstacle to peace in that region.\nWe welcome this positive step and the signing of the\nDeclaration of Principles, which envisions self-rule by\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho. We are also\npleased to note that Israel and Jordan have signed the agreed\ncommon agenda of the peace negotiations between them.\nWe congratulate all parties concerned for displaying rare\ncourage and mutual accommodation in reaching the accords.\nThese important steps, we hope, will open the way to\nreconciliation between neighbours and to the achievement of\na just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East\nbased on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973).\nThe new climate of cooperation between the United\nStates of America and the Russian Federation opens up at\nleast the prospect of real progress in disarmament. This is\namply demonstrated by the signing of the chemical weapons\nConvention in Paris earlier this year by an unprecedented\nnumber of countries. Myanmar was part of the Geneva\nConference process leading to that comprehensive\ninstrument, and continues to take an active part in the\nPreparatory Commission for the Organization for the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons.\nThe increased attention we have been devoting to\nchemical weapons should not distract us from nuclear\ndisarmament issues, notably from the need to strengthen the\ninternational non-proliferation regime and to ban all nuclear\ntesting. The enormous quantities of nuclear material that\nexist in the world today and the increasing difficulty of\ndetecting the clandestine development of nuclear weapons\nunderscore the need to redouble efforts to strengthen\nsafeguards against proliferation. Myanmar will work with\nother delegations for the success of the 1995 Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) review and extension Conference.\nWith the end of the Cold War, the case for reducing the\nnumber of large strategic nuclear weapons is strong. The\nUnited States and Russia should reduce their forces more\ndrastically than they agreed to in START II and refrain from\nimproving their nuclear arsenals both qualitatively and\nquantitatively. Meanwhile every effort must be made to\nfulfill the commitment undertaken in the 1963 Treaty\nBanning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer\nSpace and Under Water. A comprehensive ban on nuclear\ntesting has been a long-standing objective of the international\ncommunity, including Myanmar. We hope that this\nobjective will be achieved at the earliest possible date,\npreferably before the NPT review and extension Conference\nconvenes.\nThe global economic recovery remains high on the\ninternational agenda. In a highly interdependent global\neconomy, the prosperity and growth of the developed and\nthe developing countries are intertwined. We therefore\nwelcome the statement of the Group of Seven at the Tokyo\nSummit which recognizes that sustainable development and\nintegration of the developing countries into the world\neconomy is essential for global peace and prosperity. We\nlook forward to the concretization of the commitment by the\nGroup of Seven to pursue a comprehensive approach\ncovering aid, trade, investment and debt strategy.\nDebt strategy, in our view, should not be carried out on\na case-by-case basis. It should be comprehensive for all\ndebtor countries. We are encouraged by the statement that\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7\nthe major industrialized countries are determined to curb\nprotectionism and that no recourse will be made to initiatives\nand arrangements that threaten to undermine the open\nmultilateral system. High priority must be given to the\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The Punta del\nEste Declaration is still valid, as are the provisions therein\non special and differential treatment for the developing\ncountries.\nWe have always subscribed to the view that the United\nNations occupies a unique position as a major forum for the\npromotion of international cooperation for development. It\nhas now been universally recognized that world peace and\nsecurity, to be enduring must be underpinned by economic\nand social development worldwide. In this regard we share\nyour view, Mr. President, that \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" must\nnow be complemented by \\\"An Agenda for Development\\\".\nWe ardently hope that deliberations on this topic at the\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will lead to\nenhanced international cooperation for development, thereby\ncontributing to global economic recovery and international\npeace.\nIn Myanmar we believe that political progress and\neconomic development are interdependent and that both are\nvital to the well-being of the country. For this reason we\nhave been endeavouring to ensure political stability while\npromoting economic reforms. Last year I stated here that\nsteps were being taken to convene a National Convention in\norder to formulate guidelines for a firm and enduring\nconstitution.I am now happy to report that the National\nConvention commenced work on 9 January of this year.\nThe Convention is an essential prerequisite for the building\nof a democratic society in Myanmar, and its significance can\nhardly be overemphasized. It has the participation of nearly\n700 delegates comprising elected representatives,\nrepresentatives of the national races, political parties,\npeasants, workers, intelligentsia and technocrats, State\nservice personnel, and specially invited persons. There is\nuniversal agreement that the objectives of the Convention\nshould be to uphold the principles of non-disintegration of\nthe Union, non-disintegration of national solidarity and\nperpetuation of national sovereignty; to nurture the universal\nvalues of justice, liberty and equality; and to enable the\nTatmadaw, the Myanmar Defence Services, to participate in\na leading role in national politics.\nFollowing intensive deliberations, agreement has been\nreached on the chapter on the fundamental principles of the\nState, which is of paramount importance as it embodies the\nessence of the new constitution. Following extensive\ndiscussions, consensus has also been reached on these\nFundamental Principles. In a period of nine months much\nhas been accomplished. Much of course remains to be done.\nThe Convention is presently in recess in order to provide\ntime for the delegates to make necessary preparations for the\nnext phase, which will commence on 18 January 1994.\nThe delegates to the Convention have had the\nopportunity to study the Constitutions of various countries so\nthat they may cull the best from around the world.\nHowever, there can be no single model that can be copied\nand superimposed on Myanmar. The constitution to be\ndrafted must be in harmony with our own conditions and\nreflect the wishes and aspirations of the entire nation. The\nhistory of the modern nation of Myanmar is synonymous\nwith the history of the Tatmadaw. Since the time of our\nstruggle for national independence it has been in the\nforefront of national politics. On four occasions since\nindependence when the country\u2019s national sovereignty and\nindependence were threatened, the Tatmadaw was called\nupon to shoulder national responsibilities to protect and\nsafeguard the nation. The Tatmadaw does not covet power.\nNor does it have any desire to hold on to the reins of power.\nIt is above party politics. However, as it represents the\nsingle disciplined organization in the nation it is incumbent\nupon it to play a leading role in national politics,\nsafeguarding the nation, national unity and national\nsovereignty.\nOn the economic front, efforts are being made to ensure\na smooth transition from a centrally planned economy to a\nmarket economy. Now that teething pains have been\novercome the economy is on the mend. It is significant that\nthe gross domestic product grew by 10.9 per cent in\n1992-1993. The private sector, which only a few years ago\nwas almost non-existent, is expanding. Today there are a\ngrowing number of investors, both local and foreign, in\nfisheries, mining, oil exploration, manufacturing and various\nother sectors. Major offshore oil and gas finds in our waters\nhave also heightened interest among friends and neighbours\nin establishing mutually beneficial economic cooperation.\nThe political and economic changes are evidenced by\nthe vast transformations taking place in much of the country.\nIn both urban and rural areas, as well as in the border\nregions, there is unprecedented infrastructure building:\nschools, hospitals and dispensaries, as well as railways,\nroads, bridges and multi-purpose dams, are going up\neverywhere. That the people\u2019s living standards are rising is\nplain for all disinterested observers to see.\nIn spite of the positive political and economic changes\ntaking place in Myanmar, some continue to point an\naccusing finger at us in regard to human rights. It bears\nrepeating that when we speak of human rights, the diversity\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nof our people\u2019s historical, cultural and religious backgrounds\nmust neither be minimized nor forgotten. There is no unique\nmodel of implementation of human rights that can be\nsuperimposed on a given country. Any attempt to do so\nwould only spell chaos. If parts of the international\ncommunity are now beginning to contemplate the use of the\nissue of human rights as a pretext for intervening in\ndomestic affairs of States, they will only undermine the very\nrights they wish to protect and promote.\nPoverty is one of the most pressing human rights issues\nin our world today, and that is what we should seek to\novercome. In Myanmar we are giving priority to the\nelimination of poverty and the narrowing of the gap between\nthe rich and the poor, the city dwellers and the rural folk.\nWe are redoubling our efforts to ensure that all citizens have\nequal opportunity in their access to food, housing,\ntransportation, employment, education and health services.\nOn our western borders, over 40,000 returnees from\nBangladesh have been systematically received and returned\nto their hearth and home. This is the result of the good-\nneighbourly relations that exist between Myanmar and\nBangladesh. In accordance with the agreement reached\nbetween the two countries in April 1992, we will continue\nto receive those who are eligible to come as soon as their\ncases can be processed by the authorities concerned in the\ncamps. The United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, who visited Myanmar\nrecently, has been fully briefed on the important measures\nwe have taken. A memorandum of understanding between\nMyanmar and the Office of the High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) will be signed shortly; it will provide\nfor the latter\u2019s presence on the Myanmar side of the border.\nWe understand the need to find a lasting solution to the\ncomplex problem of transborder migration for economic or\nenvironmental reasons, and to that end we intend to hold\nconsultations with our Bangladeshi friends.\nIt has been our consistent policy to cooperate fully with\nthe United Nations in every field, including human rights.\nNot only have we furnished information sought by various\nUnited Nations bodies dealing with human rights; we also\nreceived in 1992 the Special Rapporteur appointed by the\nCommission on Human Rights, Mr. Yozo Yokota. We will\nreceive him yet again this year to demonstrate our good will.\nIt is our hope that Myanmar\u2019s traditional respect for human\nrights as well as the remarkable changes taking place\nthroughout the length and breadth of the country - from the\ncities and towns to the border areas - will be seen and\nappreciated.\nThrough the constructive measures taken in the past\nfive years, 10 terrorist groups have now returned to the legal\nfold. Just last week, as the result of negotiations held\nbetween the Government and Kachin national leaders in a\nspirit of mutual accommodation and understanding as befits\nblood brothers, the Kachin terrorist group returned to the\nlegal fold and has already joined hands with the Government\nin promoting peace and prosperity in the Kachin state. Just\nas the representatives of the nine preceding groups are\nactively participating in the National Convention, the\nrepresentatives of this group, too, will enjoy the same rights.\nIt augurs well for the peace and unity of our country that\nthese 10 terrorist groups which have renounced the use of\nforce have been reintegrated into the national mainstream.\nThe return of our prodigal sons from 10 different\nnational races gives the lie to allegations that minority\ngroups in Myanmar are being oppressed, that their human\nrights are being grossly violated and that democracy is non-\nexistent in the country. Never before in the history of\nindependent Myanmar have so many terrorist groups\nreturned to the legal fold in such numbers. That they have\ndone so is unmistakable testimony to the complete trust and\nconfidence which the national races have in the policy of\nnational reconciliation espoused by the State Law and Order\nRestoration Council and in its good will and sincerity. Few\nGovernments can claim such positive achievements.\nThe problem of illicit drugs is like a cancer that poses\na great threat to the stability and well-being not only of our\ncountry but also of the international community. Myanmar\nremains steadfast in its resolve to overcome this scourge.\nWe realize that the problem of illicit drugs and trafficking\ntranscends borders and is too complex to be tackled by any\ncountry acting alone. We have accordingly been working\ntogether with the United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme (UNDCP) and neighbouring countries to expand\nactivities aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs and\neventually eliminating opium cultivation altogether. In June\n1992 Myanmar took the initiative by signing agreements\nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China and the UNDCP and\nalso with Thailand and the UNDCP regarding crop\nsubstitution, demand reduction and law enforcement.\nUNDCP experts are already in the country working to\nachieve these goals. Myanmar and Laos have also agreed to\ncooperate in this regard. The Governments of Myanmar,\nLaos, Thailand and China, aware that the problems of illicit\ndrug production, trafficking and abuse can be addressed only\nthrough concerted international efforts, will sign a\nmemorandum of understanding with the UNDCP during the\ncourse of the high-level plenary meetings of the General\nAssembly on drug control to be held in New York from 26\nto 27 October.\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9\nLast April, Myanmar signed a drug agreement with\nIndia, and a similar agreement will be worked out with our\nremaining neighbour, Bangladesh. We are confident that\nthis comprehensive and coordinated effort at the subregional\nlevel will produce the desired results. In the past year the\nstrategy of combining prevention, education, treatment and\nrehabilitation of addicts, law enforcement and border area\ndevelopment has borne fruit. Significant amounts of illicit\ndrugs and drug paraphernalia have been seized and\ndestroyed. United Nations personnel and other visitors have\nbeen given the opportunity to visit the regions where opium\nis grown.\nIn August, United States Congressman Charles B.\nRangel, Chairman of the House Narcotics Abuse and Control\nCommittee, and Congressman Bill Richardson visited eastern\nShan State to acquire first-hand knowledge of the illicit drug\nproblem. During the visit they witnessed the destruction of\nlarge amounts of opium, heroin, opium oil, liquid opium and\nother drugs seized by the Myanmar authorities. Myanmar\nwill continue to give top priority to overcoming the threat\nposed by illicit drugs, and it is our hope that more and more\ncountries will join hands with us in this noble endeavour.\nMyanmar today is on the threshold of a new era. The\npolitical, economic, social and administrative reforms\ncurrently being implemented herald a united, stable, peaceful\nand prosperous country. The new society will guarantee the\nunity of the national races and ensure the perpetuation of our\nnational independence and sovereignty. It will be in\nharmony with its environment, its historical experiences, and\nthe political, economic and social conditions of the nation.\nIt will reflect the diverse culture and traditions of the\nnational races in the union.\nThe new Myanmar nation that is envisaged by the\nNational Convention will be a genuine multi-party\ndemocratic state. It will be a nation based on the universal\nvalues of justice, liberty and equality. There will be social\njustice, economic justice and political justice. There will be\na complete separation of powers of state, and the judiciary\nwill enjoy total independence. Freedom of thought, freedom\nof expression, freedom of belief, freedom of worship,\nfreedom to seek a livelihood and freedom of organization\nwill be guaranteed. There will also be equality of status,\nequality of opportunity and equality before the law.\nThese conditions will not materialize of their own\naccord. The right atmosphere must be created. To this end,\nmy Government is doing its utmost to vindicate the trust\nplaced in it by the people. As the democratic society\nenvisaged is for the people of Myanmar, it must reflect the\nobjective conditions of the country and be established in the\nmanner and at the pace best suited to it.\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the Tatmadaw\nhave never failed the people in their hour of need and will\nnot do so at this historic moment when a new nation is\nbeing created.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Lesotho\ndelegation and on my own behalf, I wish to congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. His\nelection is a well-deserved tribute to his great personal\nqualities and also to the dynamic role that the Republic of\nGuyana has always played within the United Nations and in\nworld affairs. We are also indebted to the dedication and\nthe effective manner in which his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the Republic of Bulgaria,\nguided the deliberations of this lofty body during the forty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\nAllow me also to extend our congratulations to that\ndistinguished son of Africa, His Excellency Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nwhose untiring global efforts for peace continue to inspire us\nall. My delegation wishes to reiterate once more its\nreadiness to continue to cooperate with him in every way\nthat would promote international cooperation and\nunderstanding, in conformity with the Charter of our\nOrganization.\nOn behalf of my delegation, allow me also to express,\nlike those who have spoken before me, deepest condolences\nto the Government and the people of the Republic of India\nfor the tragic loss of human lives resulting from the recent\nearthquake in that country.\nSince 1945 the membership of the United Nations has\nincreased dramatically, lending credence to the universality\nof this Organization and bearing out the wisdom of the\nfounding fathers. Today we welcome the new Members to\na United Nations whose numerical strength is matched by\nthe broadened scope of its vision, the depth of its\ncommitment to global issues and the capacity of its\noperations world wide which, more than ever before, it\nbehooves us all to enhance further. We also look forward to\nwelcoming back into the fold a free, democratic and\nnon-racial Republic of South Africa in the very near future.\nWith the emergence of the new world order, we are\ntoday at a high tide of opportunity to realize the vision of\nglobal peace that inspired the United Nations Charter in\n1945. The original design for peace, as outlined in the\nCharter in 1945, seems to be in sight with the emergence of\nthat new world order.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 11\nThe commendable efforts made by the\nSecretary-General towards the promotion of international\npeace and security and for the consolidation of peaceful\ncoexistence among nations are about to bear results.\nFollowing the period characterized by international relations\nof confrontation between the military blocs of East and\nWest, we see around us today an increasing recognition\namong nations of the need for the settlement of international\nand regional problems by peaceful means, that is, through\nnegotiation and dialogue. All these developments augur well\nfor the realization of the goals and objectives we set for\nourselves in San Francisco in 1945.\nRecent developments, however, continue to test our\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to make the initiative of 1945 a\nreality. New challenges have emerged and continue to\nconfront us. Though different in nature and content from\nthose of the past, they are no less important in their bearing,\nscope and influence on peace and the future of mankind.\nThe beginning of this last decade of the century held\nout hope for international peace and stability. The world\ncommunity lifted itself from the trenches of the cold war,\npledging to build for mankind a new world order firmly\nbased on legitimacy, cooperation and respect for the rights\nand dignity of the human person. The residual tendencies to\nconfrontation were also collectively suppressed by the united\nworld action in the Gulf.\nThe euphoria of a world finally at peace has not,\nregrettably, been universal. From Angola to Somalia to\nBosnia and Herzegovina and, recently, in the political\nstandoff in the Russian Federation, we witness a world\nhaunted anew by disputes originating from legacies of the\npast. The destructiveness and brutality of internal wars are\nthreatening to unweave the very tapestry on which\ncivilization is based.\nAs it stands on the eve of celebrating the golden jubilee\nof the Charter, the world body must recognize the need for\nincreased resources and more balanced burden-sharing\namong Member States in order to strengthen the capacity of\nthe United Nations to fulfil effectively its peacemaking and\npeace-keeping obligations. It must continue to pursue more\nresolutely the objectives of the Charter, all of which stipulate\nthat the realization of peace and development are legitimate\naspirations of all peoples.\nIn the past we have talked about the urgent need for the\ndemocratization and restructuring of the United Nations. In\nthis regard, we take note of the commendable efforts which\nare being made by the Secretary-General to strengthen the\nstructures of the other organs of the Organization within the\ncontext of \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" and through regional\ncommissions.\nIn the aftermath of the cold war and at a time when\ninternational relations are being reshaped, it is necessary that\nthe imbalances inherent in the present United Nations system\nbe reviewed and corrected. Such an exercise should take\ninto account the principles of decentralization of resources\nand equitable geographical representation in the decision-\nmaking organs of the world body. Like a world parliament,\nthe United Nations must reflect in its structures the same\ndemocratic values that it advocates, the values of fairness,\ntransparency and equitable representation, in order to\nvalidate the principle of equality of States.\nThe need for democratization extends, in particular, to\nthe Security Council. The African continent accounts for\nalmost one third of the United Nations membership. In the\nspirit of reflecting the regional diversity of our Organization,\nwe must consider positively the interest of Africa in being\nallotted at least two permanent seats on the Security Council\nand an increased number of non-permanent seats.\nNever before in the history of the United Nations has\nthe world been presented with a greater opportunity for\npeace. The challenge of this opportunity will require us to\nconduct international relations with the vision and realism of\npeople who recognize how near, in the past, the world has\nbeen to the edge of the precipice.\nThe United Nations global peace-keeping missions are\na beacon of hope and a source of inspiration to peace-loving\ncommunities world wide that are ravaged by war and strife\nand in many cases have nowhere else to turn. But even in\nthese trying times, a great opportunity exists, an opportunity\npossibly greater than any the world community of nations\nhas seen since the founding of this Organization for the\ncreation and maintenance of global peace.\nNotwithstanding the positive initiative taken by the\nmajor nuclear Powers since the end of the cold war, there is\nstill a need to establish a close link between disarmament\nand international peace in the years ahead. This is the ideal\nformula to fulfil the aspirations of mankind for a life that is\nfree from the threat of war. To be effective towards this\nend, disarmament must be universal and embrace all\ncategories of weapons, including conventional weapons.\nWe also recognize that the global reduction of military\nexpenditures could enable the world to redirect its resources\nto development and to meet the challenge of reversing the\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nenvironmental degradation of our planet on the eve of the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe hopes of the world were placed last year in the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED). The Earth Summit broke fresh\nground in addressing global environmental and development\ncrises. While it did not solve these problems, it at least\nsucceeded in building a large amount of goodwill for the\nglobal economic partnership that is so vital if addressing the\nmany environmental problems that the UNCED process\nrecognized and, indeed, highlighted, are to be addressed.\nMore than a year after the Rio Conference, the\nestablishment of the high-level Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment remains the most tangible development so far.\nThe majority of the commitments made by world\nGovernments in Rio are yet to be matched with actual deeds.\nThe global trends towards the reduction of aid budgets by\nthe developed countries and the intensifying commercial and\npolitical pressure on aid administration contrast sharply with\nthe commitments made by these countries in Rio to reach\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national\nproduct in aid towards assisting the developing countries\nmake a transition to sustainable development.\nAnother source of great disappointment is the\ncontinuing decline in voluntary contributions to the United\nNations operational activities. The United Nations system\nhas a central role to play in channelling assistance to\ndeveloping countries, capitalizing on its comparative\nadvantages of neutrality, widespread field-level presence and\nrapid response.\nThe least developed countries are continuing to\nexperience a deterioration of their socio-economic situation\nowing to profound structural constraints and handicaps which\nreduce their ability to overcome the negative impact of\nexternal factors. The issue of the stalemate in multilateral\ntrade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT) is a matter of great concern to the\ndeveloping countries. Further delays towards successful,\nbalanced and comprehensive GATT negotiations will render\nthe principle of trade as the engine of growth and\ndevelopment an illusion. These basic economic structural\nproblems, coupled with a proneness to natural disasters,\nseriously hamper these countries\u2019 efforts towards meaningful\neconomic growth.\nThe recent drought which struck the countries of\neastern and southern Africa was the worst ever. In Lesotho,\nthe Government has had to declare a state of continuing\ndrought emergency and to extend provision of drought-relief\nmeasures for another year, until June 1994. We wish to\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General and his team\nfor their efforts in convening, jointly with the Southern\nAfrican Development Community, a donors\u2019 conference in\nGeneva last year to address the drought problem. Similarly,\nwe wish to thank the international community for its\ndemonstration of solidarity with our region at a time of\ndesperate need.\nThe Kingdom of Lesotho welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277).\nThis document contains far-reaching recommendations on\npeacemaking, peace-building and peace-keeping. However,\nthe implementation of these recommendations will fall short\nof attaining the intended results fully if they are not\ncomplemented with efforts to harness and reverse the further\ndeterioration in peoples\u2019 socio-economic situations. It is on\nthis basis that my delegation lends its full support to General\nAssembly resolution 47/181 on the \\\"Agenda for\nDevelopment\\\". We stand ready to engage in constructive\ndebate on the Secretary-General\u2019s preliminary report on \\\"An\nAgenda for Development\\\".\nThe world today faces profound changes, which are\nfuelled by the deep desire of people across the globe for\nrespect for their basic human rights, for democracy, for\npublic accountability and good governance. The\ndemocratically elected Government of the Kingdom of\nLesotho embraces the idea and concept of national\nreconciliation, for which the people of Lesotho have yearned\nfor so long. The Government has also embarked on a\nvigorous campaign to inculcate and nurture the culture of\ndemocracy, respect for basic human rights and popular\nparticipation, which should, in turn, have an impact on social\nmobilization for development, democratic institution-\nbuilding, political stability and national prosperity.\nThe new Government views the 1993 general election\nand the overwhelming popular mandate it received for the\nstewardship of the nation\u2019s affairs as a golden opportunity to\naddress, with fresh impetus, the urgent national issues of\npoverty, ignorance and disease. We therefore wish to make\na special appeal to the donor community to lend a helping\nhand to our efforts in this regard, in the considered belief\nthat democracy and development are complementary.\nOn behalf of the Government and the peace-loving\npeople of Lesotho, I wish to express our gratitude for the\nprompt and generous support and assistance we received\nfrom the international community towards the success of our\nreturn to democratic civilian rule.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 13\nThe situation in South Africa is always a cause for\nconcern in Lesotho, as South Africa is our only immediate\nneighbour. Despite our concern with the ever-rising levels\nof violence and the increasing resolve by the right-wing\nelements to engage in sabotage in South Africa, we are\nencouraged by what has been achieved through negotiations\nin that country. In particular, we applaud the agreement\nreached by the negotiating parties on the date of the end of\nApril 1994 for the holding of the first democratic elections\nas well as the establishment of the Transitional Executive\nCouncil to oversee the transitional arrangements prior to\nelections. While we acknowledge and support the call for\nthe lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa, we\nurge the United Nations to upgrade the United Nations\nmonitoring team in South Africa in order to give effective\nmeaning to the Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\" and its central message of preventive diplomacy,\npeace-building and peacemaking.\nIt is our fervent hope that the lessons of the Kingdom\nof Lesotho\u2019s peaceful transition to democracy will not be\nlost on the citizens of South Africa, whose own chance to\nelect a Government of their choice for the first time seems\nwithin reach.\nThe people of Angola, another sister country in the\nsubregion, continue to be denied a chance for peace by\nUNITA. We condemn UNITA for the escalation of the\nmilitary actions and for the continued massacre of innocent\ncivilians and the destruction of the infrastructure in Angola.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General and take\nnote of Security Council resolution 851 (1993), which\nimposes a number of sanctions intended to limit the ability\nof UNITA to continue with its war effort.\nWe also wish to applaud the decision by the United\nStates to recognize and establish diplomatic contact with the\nGovernment of Angola, as well as the subsequent positive\ninitiatives for peace taken by the United States in Angola.\nMozambique is currently enjoying relative peace. The\nGeneral Peace Agreement signed in Rome is holding, and\nthe parties have continued to exercise restraint. We appeal\nto the parties concerned to implement the peace accords\nwithout delay and to cooperate with the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative in full, including the timely\nimplementation of the mandate of the United Nations\nOperation in Mozambique.\nIn Liberia, we are optimistic that the collaboration\nbetween the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia\n(UNOMIL) and the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) Military Observer Group (ECOMOG),\ntogether with the Peace Agreement signed in Cotonou in\nJuly 1993, will bring lasting peace and that the warring\nfactions will stop hostilities and agree on a transitional\narrangement to lead the country to democratic elections.\nLast, but not least, it is heartening to see real hope of\na solution to one of the bloodiest, most impassioned and\nmost obdurate conflicts of our time in the Middle East. The\nsigning last month of the peace accord between the State of\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization is a victory\nfor common sense and the validation of peaceful methods in\nresolving disputes between States. The virtue of this mutual\nachievement is that it puts coexistence to a test in reality and\nnot in mere exchange of rhetoric.\nNone of this, however, should distract the world from\nthe reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to\nnationhood in accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nDuring the World Conference on Human Rights, held\nin June this year, the whole world converged in Vienna to\ndiscuss human rights issues. Although the World\nConference was inundated with diverse interpretations of\nhuman rights, a great deal of progress was made. My\ndelegation believes that the international community should\nrededicate itself to the Vienna Declaration and Programme\nof Action as the central document in the effective\nimplementation of existing human rights instruments and\ncommit itself to the principles enshrined in the Charter of\nthe United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights.\nIn conclusion, my delegation would wish to emphasize\nonce again that it remains for us to join hands and strive\nresolutely in all spheres of human endeavour to ensure the\nvery survival of current and succeeding generations. Let this\nOrganization remain the burning light of hope and\ninspiration for all mankind. For all its differences, and for\nall its diversity, ours is a world of interdependence and\ndestinies inextricably joined. Let us renew our resolve to\npursue to the end the lofty purposes and principles of the\nCharter of our Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of Belize takes\nimmense pride, Sir, in your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. This is the\nfirst time in the history of the Organization that a\nCommonwealth Caribbean national has been chosen to\nsuperintend the deliberations of the General Assembly. Your\nelection is, thus, not only the highest tribute that could have\nbeen paid you, but is also the accomplishment of your\ncountry, Guyana, and of the wider Commonwealth\nCaribbean. As a part of the latter, Belize may be forgiven\nfor any note of self-congratulation that creeps into the\nencomiums we heap upon you today.\nIn that regard - and we say this only slightly with\ntongue in cheek - we note that almost your first act of\nwisdom upon assuming office was the selection of a very\nexcellent Belizean as presidential spokesperson.\nLet me at this time also record my delegation\u2019s\nappreciation of the most able manner in which the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, conducted the work of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-seventh session.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn addition, may I take the opportunity to welcome\nformally to the United Nations family the six countries - the\nCzech Republic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic, The\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra -\nwhich have joined the Organization this year.\nAllow me also to offer, on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of Belize, our deep sympathy to the people and\nthe Government of India for the heavy death toll and\nconsiderable material loss caused by the devastating\nearthquake on 30 September.\nOver the five years since I last appeared in this Hall,\nmany things have changed in the world. In Belize we, too,\nhave experienced change. On 30 June 1993 the people of\nBelize voted, through peaceful elections, for a new\ngovernment. Once more we have demonstrated the stability\nof our democratic institutions and the maturity of our polity.\nIn an age when the so-called global trend towards\ndemocratization seems at times to be a process that moves\none step forward and two steps back, we in Belize are justly\nproud of our record.\nIn these five years, some of the changes occurring in\nthe global prospect have been favourable, and many of these\nare attributable to this Organization, which, under its\ndistinguished Secretary-General, has been striving to fulfil\nthe mandate of its Charter and find ways and means to cope\nwith problems not necessarily envisaged by the framers of\nthat Charter.\nIn the brief tour d\u2019horizon of the international scene\nwhich I shall undertake today, the first matter I wish to\naddress is peace and security. We are very gratified by the\npositive developments that have occurred in several places.\nUppermost in our minds is our own subregion of Central\nAmerica. There we have been heartened by the movement\nof several of our neighbours towards reconciliation and\nsocial justice.\nIn particular, we note with satisfaction that the brief\nhiccup of the events in the Republic of Guatemala in May\nand June does not appear to have seriously flawed that\ncountry\u2019s efforts at permanent redemocratization. We are\nhappy that the new government there has publicly confirmed\nGuatemala\u2019s recognition of sovereign and independent\nBelize. Diplomatic relations between our two countries can\nonce again proceed apace; and we shall continue the work\nfor the preservation of bilateral and regional security and the\nsearch for a lasting solution to the issues that still bedevil us.\nIn accordance with the principles enunciated by this\nOrganization, such a solution must be on the basis of mutual\nrespect for peace, for the rights of both countries to\nself-determination and for the integrity of each other\u2019s land\nand sea territory.\nIn the Caribbean we have hopes that the long-suffering\npeople of Haiti will be rewarded by the return of its\nlegitimate government.\nRecent developments in South Africa are clearly very\nencouraging, and we are confident of the success of the\ntransition to majority rule, which will be heralded by the\nnon-racial elections scheduled for April 1994.\nThen, in the midst of continued strife in the Middle\nEast, we believe we see positive signs of the way forward\nwith the dramatic opening between the people of Palestine\nand the State of Israel. At long last there seems a real\npossibility of the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-\ndetermination coexisting with the State of Israel\u2019s right to\nsafe and secure borders.\nWe welcome the finalization of the demarcation of the\nboundary between Kuwait and Iraq, which was accomplished\nby the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission on\n20 May 1993. We also welcome the adoption by the\nSecurity Council of resolution 833 (1993), in which it\nguaranteed the inviolability of the boundary between the two\nStates.\nEncouraging, too, has been the consolidation of the\nbroad consultative mechanisms for confidence-building,\nsecurity, human rights and cooperation originally established\nfor Europe in the Helsinki Conference and now substantially\nexpanded. Such structures have considerable value, and we\nunderstand that our colleagues in the countries members of\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\nin the process of developing a similar mechanism with a\ndistinct ASEAN character. Above all, we commend the\nSecretary-General for his vision in \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nDespite all these promising developments, however, the\noverall outlook for world security remains bleak. In far too\nmany places the peace is disrupted by fratricidal struggle.\nEverywhere the crushing burden of armaments - to employ\na famous expression used by President Roosevelt and\nWinston Churchill in 1941 - bids to drive our planet off its\nestablished course. The Second World War was partly\nfought, and this great Organization was largely established,\nto eradicate programmes of ethnic genocide. Now, nearly\n50 years after the birth of the United Nations, we are\nexperiencing several such programmes on a massive scale.\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 15\nI urge that during this session we take the first major\nstep to right these imbalances, which affect global peace and\nsecurity. Just as the Helsinki model is one way forward, we\nhope that another is the International Tribunal on war\ncrimes, the judges of which this Assembly recently elected.\nAmong other steps which might be taken are the\nfollowing: Governments must forswear profiteering from\nthe sale or sponsorship of the sale of armaments. There\nmust be an expansion of regional and subregional systems of\ncooperation and coordination in the cognate areas of\nsecurity, narcotics interdiction and counter-terrorism. This\nbody must make firm recommendations for the development\nand rigid enforcement of domestic neutrality laws\neverywhere. Likewise, the international law relating to\nneutrality must be thoroughly modernized to proscribe and\nseverely punish trafficking in arms. This must be not only\nin situations of belligerency, but also in cases of insurgency,\nrebellion and other armed conflict, both internal and\ninternational. The recent salutary reinvigoration of this\nOrganization\u2019s peace-keeping mechanisms must be furthered.\nThis is a time when the United Nations is increasingly\nbeing called upon to act as a peacemaker in troubled and\nturbulent regions of the world. It is to the Organization\u2019s\ncredit that it has risen to the occasion by undertaking\ncomplex and challenqinq assignments around the globe.\nThere was a time when United Nations peace-keeping\nforces could successfully be composed of contingents from\nthe so-called third world countries. But recent experience\nhas now shown that large and difficult operations of the\nBosnia and Somalia type stand little chance of success\nwithout the active participation of major Powers. In this\ncontext, we welcome President Clinton\u2019s speech in this\nsession of the Assembly, offering to commit United States\ntroops to the United Nations Bosnia operation under certain\nconditions.\nYet there is still a role for small States. And we in\nBelize would be prepared to offer training facilities to the\nOrganization as a contribution to increasing the efficiency of\npeace-keeping forces. This would be in accordance with\nArticle 43 of the Charter, which calls for member\nGovernments to make available to the Security Council\n\\\"assistance and facilities ... necessary for the purpose of\nmaintaining international peace and security\\\". Needless to\nsay, we would be happy to make our contribution in concert\nwith other countries in our area. Either pre-existing regional\nsecurity mechanisms and/or new bilateral and multilateral\narrangements might serve as the vehicle for small country\nefforts at cooperation.\nAs a backdrop to all this, the provisions of the Charter\nrelative to peacemaking must be strengthened. In particular,\na standing United Nations force under unified United\nNations command should be considered and the Military\nStaff Committee must be made fully operational. In keeping\nwith the Secretary-General\u2019s quest to improve efficiencies,\nstrict military discipline of United Nations forces must be\nestablished and there must be improved coordination at\nHeadquarters and in the field.\nThe most important of the steps which my Government\nbelieves should be taken is reform of the Security Council.\nIt is self-evident that in these times of turmoil and increased\nUnited Nations activity the agenda item of equitable\nrepresentation on, and increase in membership of, the\nCouncil looms large. Belize has recently submitted a paper\nto the Secretary-General, detailing our ideas on this\nall-important topic.\nI wish to turn next to international cooperation. I\nbelieve that there exists an international legal obligation to\ncooperate in good faith. It is anticipated in the Articles on\nprinciples and purposes and other provisions of the United\nNations Charter, and is reiterated in such Declarations as the\nfriendly relations Declaration of 1970 and the 1974 Charter\nof Economic Rights and Duties of States. I will address the\nquestion of economic cooperation at a later stage in my\nremarks. At this point, I wish to train the spotlight on\ncooperation in the area of ecospheric concerns.\nAs regards the ecosphere, Belize considers that the\nearly and universal ratification of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea is of paramount\nimportance. It will be recalled that the Convention imposes\nmyriad duties of cooperation. In that way, the weak, and not\nonly the strong and mighty, will inherit the Earth and its\nwaters.\nWe have seen two recent examples of successful efforts\nat cooperation in the ecosphere. The first involves the ozone\nlayer. In that connection, intensive cooperation by\nGovernments and by private industry, pursuant to the\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone\nLayer, as amended, has led to a significant decline in the\nrate of expansion of the hole in the ozone layer.\nMy other example is the cooperation of foreign and\ndomestic agencies with the Governments of my country,\nBelize and Costa Rica, which has contributed to substantial\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsuccess in our conservation efforts. Cognizant of these\nsuccesses, we appeal for intensive cooperation in all aspects\nof the ecosphere, including the termination of ocean and\nterrestrial dumping, the halt of desertification and the\nreduction of the causes of global warming. We also hope for\na concrete programme of action at next April\u2019s Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States to be held in Barbados.\nOne area in which we must redouble our efforts at\ncooperation is the moral environment. In numerous Member\ncountries the people have clamoured for cessation of corrupt\npractices in government and business, both national and\ninternational. Now, we are extremely happy to observe that\nthe Secretary-General has established the new post of\nAssistant Secretary-General for Inspections and\nInvestigations. In so doing, he has made it clear that the\nmoral environment of our organization must be sanitized.\nWe must support him in this endeavour. At the same time,\nwe lend our voice to those who call for the accountability of\nall inter-governmental organizations to independent auditors\nand inspectors.\nMy Government attaches the greatest importance to\nintegrity and decency in public life. We applaud such\ninternational efforts as the forthcoming anti-corruption\nconference to be held in Mexico later this year to plan\nnational strategies for fighting corruption. And we in Belize\nhave recently taken our own action to strengthen the legal\ninfrastructure necessary to banish the scourge of political\ncorruption. In just three months since taking office, we have\nintroduced four major pieces of legislation in our Parliament.\nThey are the Prevention of Corruption in Public Life Bill,\nthe Ombudsman Bill, the Contractor General Bill and the\nFreedom of Information Bill. This last, as far as we can\ndetermine, is the only one of its kind in the entire\nCommonwealth Carribean. These measures bear testimony\nto my Government\u2019s determination to wage a total war on\ncorruption and to make Belize the model of a just, honest\nand democratic society.\nI turn next to issues relating to international\ndevelopment and economic relations. For over 30 years, the\nOrganization has painstakingly sought to spell out that the\nright to development and the duty of the privileged to assist\nthe underprivileged are firmly based in international law and\npublic policies. This right and duty were part of the\n\\\"freedom from want\\\" principle, one of the founding\nprinciples of the 1942 wartime coalition that was the first to\nbe called the \\\"United Nations\\\". Freedom from want had\nnothing to do with ideology and great-Power rivalry.\nNevertheless, there have been dramatic ideological,\ngeopolitical and economic changes during the late 1980s. As\nthese changes have occurred, needs have increased but\nresources have not. Yet we have heard rumours that various\ninitiatives to bring economic justice to this planet are no\nlonger necessary.\nI respectfully suggest that nothing could be further from\nthe truth. In fact, such controversial movements as the one\nto establish a new international economic order were merely,\nas we have intimated, the reiteration of an established\nprinciple. That is, those initiatives were the renewal of an\norder, not a new order. Furthermore, in the original Somalia\nintervention, we see strong confirmation of the continuing\nvitality of the principle of \\\"freedom from want\\\" - for all of\nus will remember that the avowed objective of the current\nexercises in that beleaguered country was to bring food,\ncomfort and succour to its suffering people.\nThus, I believe, we are seeing the reaffirmation of\nfreedom from want as a human right. At the same time, I\nwould urge the Assembly to take firm steps to ensure that\nfood no longer be used as a weapon by parties to civil and\ninternational conflicts.\nIn all this we are acutely aware of the shift in world\ntrading patterns brought on by the formation of new trading\nblocs. The most recent and prominent of these are of course\nthe North American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico,\nthe United States of America and Canada, and the Single\nEuropean Market. And so, in some areas at least, the march\ntowards wider trade liberalization and true market economy\nmoves inexorably forward. But we in the South also see that\nour economies and life as we know them are threatened by\nthese developments; our preferential access to markets\nsteadily erodes and our terms of trade consistently worsen.\nWhat we are in fact concerned about here is the\npressure to open up our borders prematurely to the free flow\nof agricultural and other products from the more developed\ncountries. It is a bitter pill to swallow, even as we watch\nthe protectionist squabbling among developed countries that\nhas prevented the successful conclusion of the Uruguay\nRound of Multilateral trade negotiations under the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Of course, it\nwould also result in massive economic dislocation followed\ninevitably by social and political unrest in our countries.\nNevertheless, we acknowledge that we must in the long\nrun identify alternative commodities that we can produce\nefficiently and with comparative advantage. I must stress,\nhowever, that we are hard pressed to find the resources\nrequired for comprehensive research, development and\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 17\npromotion programmes for new products. We must be\nafforded an adequate transition period to adjust our\neconomic and production activities. I would wish, therefore,\nto take this opportunity to call on the countries members of\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment to identify and dedicate significant financial\nand technical resources to assist small countries in\ndeveloping alternative products. Of course, current trends in\nofficial and private financial flows to the developing world\nsuggest that this is a cry that will fall largely on deaf ears.\nOn a more positive note, permit me at this juncture to\napplaud the apparent resolve of the United Nations organs\nfor development assistance to improve their efforts at\ncoordination. In this connection, I single out for special\nmention the Secretary- General\u2019s ongoing formulation of an\nagenda for development and the determined spirit of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to\nstrengthen its mission and revamp its machinery. This,\nhowever, is but a beginning of what must be a crusade for\ndevelopment.\nThe last set of issues I shall address are social, political,\ncultural and humanitarian. First, we must do much more to\nensure that women are accorded their proper rights in the\ndomestic and international orders. No longer should we\nmerely echo the litany that women\u2019s development is\nindispensable for economic development. We must ensure\nthat women are accorded equal rights in all spheres.\nFurthermore, they must urgently be given equal\nrepresentation in our political, social, cultural and other\ninstitutions. Again, I take note of the recent efforts of this\nOrganization to improve the position of women in the upper\nechelons of the United Nations Secretariat.\nAs regards refugees, it would be disingenuous to call\nfor their enhanced protection without acknowledging the\nsevere problems which host countries increasingly face. For\ninstance, we in Belize do the best we can, but overcrowding\na slender raft - even in a relative haven of calm - can bring\ndire consequences to all its occupants.\nNevertheless, I am happy to report to this Assembly\nthat Belize\u2019s record of human rights is good and worthy of\nemulation. Our Constitution is founded on the principles of\njustice and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all our\npeople, and our laws and practices fully conform to the\nmandate of our Constitution.\nThe international scourge of narcotics continues\nunabated. Again, we add our voices to those who urge that\nat least the same degree of attention be given to curbing\ndemand and improving public health, as to addressing\nsupply. Narcotics, terrorism and urban violence are all gross\nmanifestations of an awful cancer seeking to engulf our\nplanet. One clear contributor to this is the mass and\nuniversal culture, or what passes for culture, purveyed by the\nmoguls of television. While we welcome the utility of the\nnew global news channels, we lament the other, baneful,\ninfluences to which our people are subjected by some\naspects of worldwide programming. It is high time that this\nOrganization tackle this problem.\nFinally, as regards human riqhts and humanitarian law,\neven over the brief period of five years since I last addressed\nthis body, we have witnessed significant expansion in the\nactivities of the Commission on Human Rights and the\nbodies established under the various United Nations\ninstruments for the protection of fundamental rights and\nfreedoms. We have seen this Organization, on invitation,\nparticipate in monitoring and conducting elections and, in the\nunprecedented case of Cambodia, actually administer a\ncountry prior to the holding of democratic elections. Yet the\nbasic rights of human beings in numerous places are still\nseriously impaired. Many of those who should protect, in\nfact violate. And conferences, tribunals and conventions\nbring scarce relief.\nIn the realm of humanitarian law, we are hopeful that\nthe International Tribunal on war crimes will set a healthy\nprecedent. Nevertheless, we view with increasing concern\nthe flouting of the Geneva regime, especially the 1977\nProtocols applicable to various forms of civil strife. That\nregime is the other side of the coin of human rights.\nWhichever side comes up when that coin is tossed, it comes\nup tarnished.\nClearly, despite a somewhat mixed record, the United\nNations is no moribund organization. Nevertheless, as it\nnears its golden jubilee, it does require additional impetus,\na more focused consensus for reform and revitalization. Let\nall of us, then, as we go about the business of this forty-\neighth session, bear well in mind the words of the Preamble\nto the Charter and accordingly pledge our rededication to the\ntask of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of\nwar, reaffirming faith in fundamental human rights and\nequality, and creating the moral climate in which justice and\ninternational law will finally prevail.\n"

The most notable changes have been\nthe diminished threat of nuclear war and an end to the\nproblems that had plagued the international community since\nthe creation of the United Nations as a result of the era of\nbipolarity and competition over spheres of influence.\nAlthough these changes have had a positive effect, the\ninternational arena has witnessed several new regional\nconflicts that have been generated by ethnic bigotry,\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nreligious fanaticism, expansionist tendencies and the spread\nof the phenomenon of terrorism, which is still sweeping over\nsome parts of the world and which continues to pose a threat\nto peace and security at the regional and international levels.\nGiven the existence of such a situation, it is incumbent on\nthe international community as a whole to address these\nproblems and to find effective solutions thereto in the\ninterests of stability, development and abiding peace and in\norder to lay the foundations of the new world order to which\nall the countries of the world aspire so that they may be able\nto face up to the many major challenges that have come to\nconfront humanity as a whole.\nThe role and responsibilities of the United Nations and\nespecially those of the Security Council have expanded,\nsince the end of the cold war, particularly in the areas of\ndevelopment and the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. There is no doubt that the adoption by the General\nAssembly of the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and other measures\naimed at restructuring and revitalizing the Organization in\nthe areas of economic and social development constitute a\nconstructive, positive step towards the shouldering by the\ninternational community of its immense responsibilities in\nthis regard. This will enhance the credibility of the United\nNations and increase its ability to become a truly effective\nmulti-purpose instrument in dealing with existing\ninternational issues.\nWe believe that within the new context of international\nrelations, the restructuring and reform of the United Nations\nshould embrace the Security Council as the organ\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. In restructuring the Council, the principle of\nequitable geographical representation of all regional groups\nshould be taken into consideration so that it may reflect the\nchanges and transformations that have taken place in the\ninternational political arena. Those changes and\ntransformations call for a new approach in addressing the\nissues of peace, security and development at the international\nlevel. Such an approach should stem from a sound\nunderstanding of the realities of an interdependent world so\nthat it may enable the international community to find\nsolutions that would go to the roots of old and new problems\nalike.\nIn this regard, we wish to stress that the issues of\npeacemaking and peace-keeping at both the regional and\ninternational levels in the context of preventive diplomacy\nshould be addressed in a manner that takes into\nconsideration the historical, geographical, political, social\nand cultural characteristics of each and every State. In so\ndoing, the international community should keep in view the\nimportance of coordination and cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, in the search for\npeaceful and commonly agreed solutions for existing\nconflicts and disputes, on the basis of international legality\nand the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe recent events in the Gulf in the wake of the\nliberation of the sister State of Kuwait have produced a new\npolitical reality which reinforced the belief in the importance\nof settling disputes by negotiation and other peaceful means\nas prescribed by the Charter of the United Nations and the\nprinciples of international law, in the interests of building\nmutual trust and consolidating peace and security, as well as\npromoting stability, coexistence and good-neighbourliness\nbetween the States of the region.\nGiven our adherence to these principles in our relations\nwith other States both regionally and internationally, the\nUnited Arab Emirates has declared its readiness and sincere\ndesire to conduct a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic\nof Iran with regard to Iran\u2019s occupation in 1971 of the three\nislands of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. From this rostrum,\nwhere many peace calls have been made, we appeal once\nagain to the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond positively\nto our call for dialogue and to start negotiating an end to this\noccupation and to return the three islands to the sovereignty\nof the United Arab Emirates.\nThe United Arab Emirates works jointly with other\nStates members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, within a\nframework of cooperation and solidarity in defining its\npolicies and its regional and international relations on the\nbasis of existing geographic, political and economic realities,\nand in a manner that is consistent with its national interests\nand its Arab and Muslim identity. In their recent Summit\nmeeting held in Abu Dhabi in December 1992, the leaders\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council affirmed the importance of\nresorting to dialogue and negotiation as a principal\ninstrumentality for settling disputes between States by\npeaceful means, in consonance with the tenets of Islamic\nSharia as well as the commitment of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil to the Charter of the United Nations and to the\nnorms and principles of international law.\nMrs. Osode (Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council also affirms the\nimportance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of States, and non-interference in their internal\naffairs. We believe that every State is entitled to choose its\nown political system and to exercise sovereignty over its\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 15\nnatural resources in line with its development objectives and\nenvironmental policies. We reject the use of force, or the\nthreat of the use of force as a means of settling disputes.\nWe hold that resorting to peaceful means in the settlement\nof disputes would enable the States involved to harness their\nresources in the interests of social and economic\ndevelopment.\nThe Iraqi regime still pursues a policy of\nprocrastination with regard to the implementation of all\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In view of this, the\ninternational community must oblige that regime to\nimplement those resolutions to respect the political system,\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait\nand to refrain from reiterating its expansionist aims.\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993) relating to the\ndemarcation of boundaries between Kuwait and Iraq,\nguarantees the inviolability of the international boundaries\nseparating the two countries in accordance with Chapter VII\nof the Charter. The resolution is a positive step and a\nfundamental international contribution towards achieving\nregional and international peace and stability.\nWe also urge the international community to pressure\nthe Iraqi regime to abide by international humanitarian law\nand release immediately all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti\nprisoners of war and detainees. An end should be put to this\nhuman tragedy which violates the basic norms of\ninternational humanitarian law.\nAt the same time, we should like to emphasize that it\nis imperative to maintain the unity and territorial integrity of\nIraq and declare that the suffering and hardships endured by\nthe Iraqi people are the responsibility of the Iraqi regime\nbecause of its refusal to implement fully all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nThe positive international developments resulting from\nthe end of bipolarity and the collapse of military alliances\nwere bound to produce their effects in our Arab region.\nToday, dialogue and cooperation between the big Powers,\nand the peaceful settlement of regional disputes, have\nreplaced the confrontations of bipolarity.\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomed the convening of\nthe Madrid Peace Conference and the holding of bilateral\nnegotiations. It also welcomed the multilateral negotiations\nin which it participated. Likewise, it welcomed the\ndeclaration of principles concluded between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel as a positive\nbeginning and a first step towards a just, comprehensive and\ndurable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\nQuestion of Palestine, on the basis of international legality\nas reflected in the relevant United Nations resolutions, most\nnotably Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973), as well as the \\\"land for peace\\\" principle. Such\na settlement should enable the Palestinian people to exercise\ntheir national inalienable rights, including the right of\nself-determination, and bring about a total Israeli withdrawal\nfrom the occupied Arab territories, including the Holy City\nof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan.\nWe support the sustained efforts undertaken by the\nLebanese Government to extend its national sovereignty over\nall the Lebanese national soil. In this regard, we call for the\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution 425\n(1978). This will contribute to the consolidation of peace\nand stability and to the creation of the conditions necessary\nfor the social and economic development of the States and\npeoples of the region.\nMy country is extremely concerned over the\ndeterioration of the security situation in the sister State of\nSomalia, which has resulted in many injuries and fatalities.\nWe support the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and\nregional organizations aimed at alleviating the suffering of\nthe people of Somalia and creating a secure environment\nconducive to the continuation of aid and humanitarian relief\nprogrammes and the rebuilding of national infrastructures,\nparticularly those relating to social and economic\ndevelopment.\nIn view of the strong historical ties between our people\nand the people of Somalia, the United Arab Emirates has\nextended humanitarian and financial assistance to that\ncountry, in addition to its participation in United Nations\npeace-keeping forces. We sincerely hope that all Somali\nfactions, taking into account the interests of the people of\nSomalia, will cooperate, unite and reconcile in order to\nfacilitate the United Nations mission in Somalia and resume\nnegotiations and dialogue for the sake of achieving stability,\npeace and security in that country.\nThe people and Government of the United Arab\nEmirates have followed with deep sorrow the tragedy that\nhas beset the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for well\nover 18 months. My country has also condemned the acts\nof killing, displacement, ethnic cleansing, genocide and rape\nperpetrated by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats who are\nsupported by the regular army of Serbia and Montenegro.\nThe victims of such atrocities have been largely the Bosnian\nMuslims. My country supports the Security Council and\nGeneral Assembly resolutions relating to the trial and\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\npunishment of the perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The implementation of these resolutions will\ngo a long way towards demonstrating that the international\ncommunity honours its obligations and that the United\nNations lives up to the Charter and principles of international\nlaw.\nThe partition plan recently proposed in the Geneva talks\nfor the settlement of the dispute in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nlacks fairness and justice because it legitimizes aggression\nand \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and rewards the aggressors by\nallowing them to annex the territories they have conquered\nby force. In the face of this tragic situation, the international\ncommunity bears the historical and moral responsibility of\ndefending a State Member of the United Nations and\npreserving its independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity\nand enabling it to exercise its legitimate right of\nself-defence.\nThe progress recently achieved in the recent\nnegotiations between the political parties of South Africa,\nwhich culminated in a decision to form the Transitional\nExecutive Council, represents a positive step towards\nestablishing an interim Government and finalizing the\narrangements for the elections to be held early next year.\nThis progress may also be a significant step towards the\nformulation of a permanent constitution, which would lead\nto the establishment of a democratic and a united State free\nof racial discrimination.\nOne of the great challenges that still face the\ninternational community is the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. This poses\na grave threat to international peace and security; hence, it\nis the responsibility of the international community to\nencourage the adoption of confidence-building measures on\nthe regional and international levels to create a secure\ninternational environment. We believe that the nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty is the key to strengthening all\ninternational efforts and regional initiatives aimed at\npreventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and\nremoving the dangers that continue to threaten both regional\nand international peace and security.\nIn this regard, we welcome the positive steps recently\ntaken in the field of disarmament, including the Convention\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production,\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\nDestruction, which was signed by the United Arab Emirates,\nas well as by a majority of the States of the world. We\nshould also like to reaffirm the importance of establishing\nzones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction, including the Middle East.\nDespite the progress achieved in the case of certain\ninternational political and social problems, we are yet to\nwitness any noticeable improvement in the international\neconomic environment. The gap between North and South\nis getting increasingly wider, and living conditions in many\ndeveloping countries are constantly deteriorating under the\nheavy burden of foreign debt, the continuing decline in the\nprice of commodities, and the terms of trade as well as the\nnegative impact of protectionist policies on those countries\u2019\nbalances of payments. Given this situation, it has become\nthe collective responsibility of the international community\nto restructure the existing international economic relations in\na manner that would ensure effective cooperation in\npromoting economic development in many countries,\nespecially in the developing world, and thereby to improve\ntheir living conditions.\nEconomic cooperation has expanded to new horizons,\nespecially in the areas of development and environment.\nThat was underscored by the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly through the creation of the high-level\nCommission on Sustainable Development. This indicated\nthat the international community is well aware of the nature\nof existing international problems and the importance of\nregional and international cooperation in achieving the goals\nof peace and development.\nThe member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council\n(GCC) have played an active role in the field of regional and\ninternational economic cooperation through the constructive\nand practical positions they have adopted and through their\ncontributions and assistance to the developmental efforts of\nmany third world countries. This stance stems from the\nGulf Cooperation Council countries\u2019 belief in the principles\nof economic cooperation between States, and especially with\nthe sisterly Arab and Islamic States. When measured against\nthe gross national product, the percentage of aid extended by\nthe GCC countries to developing countries is greater than\nthat provided by the developed countries, even though the\neconomies of the GCC countries are based primarily on oil,\na depletable resource. These contributions have been made\ndespite the need of all our countries to devote all their\nenergies to the process of rebuilding and maintaining their\nsocial and economic infrastructures that have been adversely\naffected by the wars and disputes of the last two decades.\nThe spirit of tolerance and commitment to human\nvalues and to the principles and purposes of the United\nNations Charter should guide us on the road to the better\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 17\nfuture that we all aspire after - a future that looks more\nattainable than ever before, in view of the regional and\ninternational changes that have taken place over the past few\nyears. All States, big and small, developed and developing,\nmust seize this historic opportunity to build on the\nmomentum of change in order that peaceful dialogue may\nprevail, consolidating the foundations of regional and\ninternational peace and security and peaceful coexistence.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, please\naccept Latvia\u2019s congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. The people of Latvia wish you a successful term as\nleader of this body.\nLatvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation States\nwhich have recently been admitted to the United Nations and\nlooks forward to cooperation with them.\nIt has been an eventful year for Latvia. On\n18 November 1993, Latvia will celebrate the seventy-fifth\nanniversary of the declaration of independence of Latvia in\n1918. Our seventy-fifth year of statehood has been marked\nby the election and the convening of our Parliament, the\nSaeima. The convening of the Saeima was an especially\nsolemn occasion in that it meant the full restoration of\nparliamentary democracy and the Constitution of 1922.\nMoreover, the convening of the Saeima completed a\nthree-year restoration process that included the\nre-establishment of our de facto independence in August\n1991 and our admission to the United Nations. The\nre-establishment of Latvia\u2019s independence and the restoration\nof its Constitution, following a half century of suspension,\nis testimony to the power of democracy, the endurance of\nthe human will and the supremacy of international law.\nTo understand the processes currently under way in\nLatvia and in our region, it is helpful to note some aspects\nof recent history. According to a secret protocol to the\nMolotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, signed by Nazi Germany\nand the Soviet Union, Latvia was relegated to the Soviet\nUnion\u2019s sphere of influence, an act which cleared the way\nfor the Soviet Union\u2019s illegal occupation of Latvia in 1940.\nEven though the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its secret\nprotocols were, under international law, void at their signing,\nLatvia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union shortly\nafter the occupation.\nAlthough Latvia lost its sovereignty and independence\nde facto, its status as a State continued de jure. Latvia\u2019s de\njure status continued to be recognized by many States, and\nthis position was echoed in their declarations throughout the\nfifty-year period of Latvia\u2019s occupation. The continuing\nidentity of the State of Latvia was preserved by the\napplication of the principle that illegal acts cannot validly\nchange an existing legal situation - ex injuria non oritus jus.\nConsequently, when it re-established its independence in\nl991 Latvia was quickly able to renew diplomatic relations\nwith those States with which it had had such relations prior\nto its occupation in 1940. In addition, Latvia continues to\nadhere to certain bilateral and multilateral agreements to\nwhich it became party between 1918 and 1940.\nI have stressed the matter of Latvia\u2019s continuous identity\nbetween 1918 and 1991 in order to emphasize that Latvia is\nnot a newly independent State. This fact is important\nbecause the de jure continuity of Latvian statehood has legal,\npolitical and economic consequences for Latvia, in particular\nwith respect to our relations with the Russian Federation.\nThe key to stable and friendly relations between our two\nStates, in both the political and economic spheres, is\nrecognition by both parties that Latvia was illegally and\nforcibly occupied and annexed in 1940 by the Soviet Union.\nI should like to express Latvia\u2019s support for the various\nefforts by the Secretary-General and the Member States to\npromote the maintenance of international peace and security,\nin particular, efforts that were initiated by the report of the\nSecretary-General entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nRecognizing the pragmatic and forward-looking approach of\nthe proposals contained in the Secretary-General\u2019s report,\npreventive diplomacy in particular, we must also consider\nproposals that will similarly address other responsibilities of\nthe United Nations, including the enhancement of respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion\nof sustainable development. Latvia\u2019s experience with regard\nto the utilization of preventive diplomacy may be useful in\ndeveloping such proposals.\nI should like to emphasize that Latvia has utilized\npreventive diplomacy to the maximum extent possible.\nLatvia has initiated or welcomed United Nations and\nregionally sponsored efforts in fact-finding and confidencebuilding in connection with the issues facing Latvia and our\nregion. Among these efforts is our recent agreement with\nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to\nestablish a presence in Riga, our capital. These efforts have\nresulted in an increased understanding of the situation in\nLatvia, providing the United Nations, Member States and\nregional organizations with the knowledge and perspective\nto respond adequately to our problems. The\nSecretary-General, Member States and regional organizations\nhave been involved, in cooperation with Latvia, in applying\nthese measures to the most important and urgent matter now\nconfronted by Latvia - namely, the continued illegal presence\nof the military forces of the former Soviet Union on Latvian\nterritory.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 7\nFor over two years, Latvia has sought the removal of\nthe former Soviet Union\u2019s military forces from its territory,\nthrough bilateral negotiations with the Russian Federation\nand with the assistance of the international community. Yet\nthese forces, now under the control of our large neighbour,\nthe Russian Federation, are still stationed on our territory.\nLast year the General Assembly addressed this issue\nunder the agenda item entitled \\\"Complete withdrawal of\nforeign military forces from the territories of the Baltic\nStates\\\". In adopting resolution 47/21 by consensus, the\nGeneral Assembly called upon the Baltic States and the\nRussian Federation\n\\\"to conclude without delay appropriate agreements,\nincluding timetables, for the early, orderly and complete\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the\nterritories of Estonia and Latvia\\\". (resolution 47/21,\npara. 2)\nThe Russian Federation, in joining in the consensus for the\nadoption of resolution 47/21, affirmed its obligation to\nwithdraw its military forces from the Baltic States, which it\nhad earlier assumed as a participating State of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at the\nHelsinki meeting in July 1992.\nA fact-finding mission headed by Tommy Koh,\nAmbassador-at-Large of Singapore, recently returned from\nLatvia and the Baltic States to report to the\nSecretary-General on the implementation of resolution 47/21.\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his efforts at ensuring\nthe implementation of this resolution. We also wish to thank\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-seventh session, for accepting our invitation to visit\nLatvia in July 1993 and witnessing the situation in Latvia at\nfirst hand. I hope that, in addition to reviewing the situation\nregarding foreign military forces, Mr. Ganev gained insight\ninto Latvia\u2019s process of renewal.\nBefore I report to the Assembly on the present situation\nregarding the issue of the foreign military forces on the\nterritory of Latvia, I should like to express Latvia\u2019s support\nfor the ongoing democratic processes in the Russian\nFederation, at whose head is the lawfully elected President\nof the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. I hope that the\npolitical and economic reform process in the Russian\nFederation will continue and that political forces there will\nsolve their problems using peaceful and democratic means.\nAt critical moments in the past, democratic forces in the\nRussian Federation have demonstrated their ability to act\ndecisively to keep the Russian Federation on the road to\ndemocracy. I am convinced that this will also be the case in\nthese, for Russia, difficult and complicated times.\nSince February 1992, State delegations of Latvia and\nthe Russian Federation have held eight sessions of\nnegotiations on the subject of troop withdrawal from Latvia.\nThese negotiations resulted in various agreements, which\ngovern technical matters during withdrawal. Unfortunately,\nwe have failed to secure agreement on the important\nquestion of a withdrawal timetable. Latvia has consistently\ndemanded that withdrawal be completed by the end of 1993,\ntwo and a half years after Latvia regained its independence.\nThe delegation of the Russian Federation has offered final\nwithdrawal dates ranging from 1994 until 1999, without ever\nsubmitting a concrete timetable or systematic plan for\nwithdrawal. The problem of the final withdrawal date is\ncompounded by the demands of the Russian Federation to\nmaintain three bases in Latvia: the radar station in Skrunda,\nthe cosmic intelligence centre in Ventspils and the naval\nbase in Liepaja. We have repeatedly stated, and the\ninternational community, including the Russian Federation,\nhas concurred, that withdrawal should be early and complete;\nfurthermore, we cannot permit our soil to be used for\npurposes that may be directed against third countries.\nA second principal issue on which the Russian\nFederation has held up its withdrawal from Latvia is its\ndemand for extraordinary social benefits for pensioned\nofficers of the former Soviet Union and the Russian\nFederation who are residing in Latvia. For years, the officer\ncorps of the occupying army was granted favourable access\nto apartments, medical care and other social services.\nDemands for continuation of such privileges are not only\nunacceptable to Latvia, but unjust to all its residents; we\nshall not permit these demands to delay the withdrawal\nprocess.\nAt the beginning of the negotiations between our two\nStates, in February 1992, agreement was reached on certain\nmatters. Among these was the requirement that both parties\nrefrain from uncoordinated, unilateral actions during the\nperiod of withdrawal. The time since then has been marked\nby such incidents as the military forces of the Russian\nFederation conducting unauthorized troop movements on the\nground, unauthorized naval movements through Latvia\u2019s\nports and unauthorized air sorties in Latvian skies. Contrary\nto agreement, fresh recruits have secretly entered Latvia to\nreplace departing troops.\nIn the light of the continued presence of these forces,\nforeign investment in Latvia, which is necessary for the\ndevelopment of our small country, has been discouraged. In\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\naddition, the military forces of the Russian Federation have\ndone substantial damage to Latvia\u2019s environment.\nLatvia seeks an assurance that its sovereignty,\nindependence and territorial integrity will be respected and\nthat a threat to international peace and security will not arise\nfrom its territory. I hope that the negotiations with the\nRussian Federation, which began yesterday, on 28 September\n1993, will be pragmatic in nature and will soon lead to an\nagreement providing for the complete withdrawal of foreign\nmilitary forces from the territory of Latvia. Such an\nagreement would have the potential to open a new chapter\nin the relationship between our two States, a chapter\ncontaining neither suspicion nor animosity. We could then\neven foresee a time when our societies and children would\nbe free of the prejudices of the past.\nLatvia welcomes the complete withdrawal of the\nmilitary forces of the Russian Federation from Lithuania,\nwhich is a step toward improving the security of the Baltic\nregion.\nAs I have stated, it is important to recognize that Latvia\nwas illegally occupied and annexed, and that a principal\nconsequence of these events is the significantly altered\ndemographic situation there. This situation must be taken\ninto account if one is to understand the internal situation in\nLatvia. In 1940, 75 per cent of Latvia\u2019s inhabitants were\nethnic Latvians but today they constitute only 52 per cent of\nLatvia\u2019s population. During the Soviet occupation, hundreds\nof thousands of persons were deported to Siberia, and many\nthousands were arrested and executed. During the Second\nWorld War tens of thousands died, were sent to Nazi\nGermany for forced labour, or were forced to emigrate to the\nWest in order to escape the Red Terror. In sum, during the\noccupation, the pre-war population of Latvia was reduced by\none third. Among the victims who suffered this fate were\nthe Livs, one of the indigenous peoples of Latvia, who at\npresent number only a few dozen.\nDuring the post-war years, the deportation and massive\ninvoluntary emigration of Latvians from their native land\nwas paralleled by a heavy influx of residents of the Soviet\nUnion. In 1945, newly arrived Soviet military personnel\nwere immediately allocated approximately 25 per cent of all\nthe apartments in Riga, the capital of Latvia. Many of these\napartments had earlier been vacated by Latvian families\nwhich had been deported to Siberia or which had been\nforced to flee to the West. In addition to the introduction\ninto Latvia of active and retired military personnel, the\nSoviet regime, using offers of various privileges, enticed\ncivilian labourers and managers from the Soviet Union to\nmigrate to Latvia.\nThe pace of population transfer increased dramatically\nafter 1959, when Soviet leaders initiated a policy of\ncolonization for Latvia by undertaking a heavy\nindustrialization drive there. During the next 30 years the\ntotal population of Latvia increased by 27 per cent. While\nthe indigenous population grew at a rate of 7.6 per cent,\npopulation growth in the migrant community was 58.5 per\ncent, with the result that mechanical growth exceeded natural\ngrowth by close to a factor of eight. I should like to stress\nthat no other country has lost, as a result of occupation and\ncolonialism, such a large part of its indigenous population\nduring modern times. In no other modern-day country has\nthe indigenous population nearly become a minority in its\nown country, as has happened in Latvia.\nWe believe that the restoration of our independence has\ngiven us the opportunity to improve our demographic\nsituation. If we can reach a point where Latvians feel secure\nabout their future, we will then have the freedom to invest\nmore of our resources in finding solutions to global\nproblems.\nThe change in the demographic situation of Latvia\nduring the Soviet occupation cannot be conveyed by\nnumbers alone. Latvians were subjected to discrimination,\nin particular with respect to the use of the Latvian language\nand professional development. Command of the Russian\nlanguage became necessary in both the educational system\nand many workplaces, while use of the Latvian language\nwas eliminated in many spheres. Further, the policy of the\nSoviet authorities was to prevent access by Latvians to\nprofessions in various governmental and strategic fields.\nWith a view to ensuring the survival of the Latvian\npeople, it has become necessary for Latvia to develop a law\non citizenship which will safeguard the national identity of\nits indigenous population. Concurrently, Latvia will uphold\nits obligations under international human rights law.\nLatvia has already determined its present body of\ncitizens through a process of resident registration. In 1991,\nalong with the restoration of its sovereignty and\nindependence, Latvia restored citizenship to those persons\nfrom whom it had been taken in 1940; this was done\nregardless of their national, religious or ethnic backgrounds,\nand citizenship was granted to their descendants as well.\nPursuant to Latvia\u2019s Constitution, it is this body of persons\nwhich participated in the June 1993 parliamentary elections.\nLatvia\u2019s present body of citizens includes approximately\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 9\n400,000 non-ethnic Latvians, or approximately 25 per cent\nof the electorate - a figure that reflects the non-ethnic\nLatvian composition of the electorate prior to the occupation\nin 1940.\nLatvia\u2019s democratically elected Parliament, the Saeima,\nwill in the near future adopt a citizenship law which will set\nthe requirements, in accordance with international law, for\nobtaining Latvian citizenship for residents of Latvia who\narrived after 1940. Persons transferred into Latvia during the\nSoviet occupation exercise freely all rights granted by\ninternational human rights instruments. According to experts\nof the Council of Europe, the protection afforded by Latvia\u2019s\nlegislation is comparable to that provided by the\nconstitutional instruments of most States members of the\nCouncil of Europe and guaranteed collectively by the\nCouncil of Europe, in particular through the European\nConvention on Human Rights.\nHistorical minorities of Latvia such as Russians,\nBelarussians, Poles, Jews and others have their own schools\nand active national cultural societies, which help to maintain\neach group\u2019s national identity.\nA peaceful, legal and pragmatic restoration process has\nbegun in Latvia. Numerous appraisals by the international\ncommunity have affirmed that this process is in fact peaceful\nand is being conducted within the confines of international\nlaw.\nLatvia has no reason to hide its internal situation and\nhas thus welcomed numerous examinations of its human\nrights record. On behalf of Latvia, I should like to thank the\nSecretary-General and the States Members of the United\nNations for the fact-finding mission, headed by the present\nAssistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, Mr. Ibrahima\nFall, which visited Latvia in October 1992. I should like to\nquote from the Mission\u2019s conclusions:\n\\\"Latvia is going through a transitional period\nfollowing the reestablishment of independence. During\nthis period the Latvian Government is endeavouring to\nredress certain historical inequities and injustices\nperpetrated during Soviet rule from 1940 to 1991.\n\\\"This has given rise to anxiety among the\nnon-ethnic Latvians about their future status and role in\nthe country. It is this sense of insecurity rather than\nany gross violation of human rights that is most\ncharacteristic of the situation prevailing in Latvia today.\n\\\"The information received and examined by the\nMission does not reveal gross and systematic violations\nof human rights in Latvia. Individual violations which\nhave been reported are limited and not related to\ndiscriminatory policy as such and they should and can\nbe remedied at the appropriate level. On the positive\nside, it should be emphasized that no instances of\nviolence, no mass dismissals from employment,\nexclusion from educational establishments, evictions\nfrom apartments, or expulsions were reported.\\\"\n(A/47/748, paras. 21-23)\nThe report of the United Nations human rights\nfact-finding mission to Latvia is similar to reports submitted\nby the Council of Europe, the Conference on Security and\nCo-operation in Europe and the European Court of Human\nRights. Despite these numerous affirmations that human\nrights are not being violated in Latvia, it has become the\nobject of political attacks - the Russian Federation constantly\naccuses Latvia of human rights violations. Latvia has\nexpended great efforts and resources to refute these\nunsubstantiated allegations. In addition, resources of\ninternational organizations, including the United Nations,\nhave been expended.\nI shall now address the grave financial crisis that faces\nthe United Nations and has forced the Secretary-General to\ntake drastic measures to economize. Latvia believes that a\nsolution to the crisis that is acceptable to all Member States\nand based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations must be found.\nLatvia wishes to bring to the attention of the General\nAssembly an ad hoc decision which was made for reasons\nof financial and political expediency, but which will in fact\ncontribute to the financial crisis. I am referring to the\ndecision taken by the General Assembly in December 1992\nto determine, inter alia, the assessment rates of 15 Member\nStates, including Latvia, according to an ad hoc method\nrather than the standard method for determining capacity to\npay.\nThe December 1992 decision is not in accordance with\nthe Charter principle of sovereign equality because the two\ndifferent methods for determining assessments result in\nunequal financial obligations for different Member States.\nNotwithstanding the fact that Latvia and the other two Baltic\nStates are not successors to the former Soviet Union, they\nhave been made to assume excessive financial obligations of\nthe former Soviet Union and even to accept a portion of its\ncontribution to the Working Capital Fund.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nLatvia is now entering its third year as a State Member\nof the United Nations. We expect to increase our\ninvolvement in the work of the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations, participating in the search for\nsolutions to global problems. At the World Conference on\nHuman Rights in Vienna, we addressed two problem areas\nwhere we should be able to make contributions: the rights\nof minorities and the rights of foreigners.\nLatvia reiterates the offer it made at the Earth Summit\nin Rio de Janeiro to host an international conference in its\nresort city of Jurmala to examine possibilities for redirecting\nresources from armaments towards rehabilitating the\nenvironment.\nLatvia supports the establishment of the post of United\nNations high commissioner for human rights. We also urge\nan increase in the percentage of the regular budget allocated\nto the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva.\nThe position of Latvia regarding non-governmental\norganizations is that they play a valuable role on the\ninternational stage, especially in the area of human rights.\nTheir access to the United Nations human-rights system\nshould be increased.\nWith respect to the debate on restructuring the Security\nCouncil, Latvia supports increasing the number of members\nof the Security Council. Such reform must ensure that the\nCouncil is adequately balanced between large and small\nStates.\nLatvia supports the efforts aimed at rationalizing the\nstructure and the agenda of the General Assembly.\nLatvia welcomes the positive processes under way in\nthe Middle East, South Africa, Cambodia and Haiti. We\nhope that, with the efforts of the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations, peace will prevail in the former\nYugoslavia, Georgia, Somalia and elsewhere where blood is\nstill being spilt.\nLatvia has a history of participation in international\naffairs, including its term as Presiding Member of the\nCouncil of the League of Nations. In order to mark our\nhistoric contribution to international relations, and to\ncelebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the signing of our\ndeclaration of independence, Latvia has undertaken the task\nof restoring a hall at the United Nations Office in Geneva.\nThis hall, located in the Palais des Nations, and adorned\nwith amber collected from the shores of the Baltic Sea, was\ndecorated and endowed by the Government and the people\nof Latvia in 1938 as a donation to the League of Nations.\nMay the return of that hall at the Palais des Nations to its\noriginal splendour symbolize the victory of justice\nconstituted by the return of Latvia to full membership in the\ninternational community.\nIt is my belief that the restoration of our independence\nwill enable Latvia, a small State, to play a greater role in\nsecuring peace and democracy in the world. I am convinced\nthat together we can leave our children a better world with\nmore security, more faith and more freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to extend to\nrepresentatives the warm greetings of the people of Chad\nand to express their sincere wishes for peace.\nBefore conveying to Members the message of the\nTransition Government of the Republic of Chad, I should\nlike to extend to you, Sir, my delegation\u2019s congratulations on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. I assure you that, in the discharge of\nthis difficult task, you will have the ready and full\ncooperation of my delegation.\nI should like also to express to your predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, our gratitude for the dedication with\nwhich he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its\nforty-seventh session.\nOur thanks go also to our dynamic Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his continuing commendable\nand tireless efforts in the cause of peace and development\nthroughout the world.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIt is also a pleasure to welcome the delegations of the\nCzech Republic, Slovakia, The Former Yugoslav Republic\nof Macedonia, Eritrea, the Principality of Andorra and the\nPrincipality of Monaco.\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\nbeginning at a time when clear hopes for peace in certain\nregions are emerging, yet war continues to cause\nunspeakable suffering elsewhere. Misery is increasing\nthroughout the world, and the gap between the richest and\nthe poorest continues to widen. Given these problems, the\nUnited Nations is increasingly called upon for assistance.\nConsequently, its capacity to react and to intervene is\nreduced.\nConcerted action by people of good will who love\npeace and freedom and who work to reduce poverty and\nmisery and to advance democracy and human rights could\nhelp to limit the number of calls for assistance that are now\nbeing made on this Organization.\nWithin this framework, Chad set out on the road to\ndemocracy in 1990. This deliberate choice was made in the\nlight of the recent history of our country and the profound\naspirations of our people to peace and social well-being. In\nthis regard, the Sovereign National Conference that was held\nfrom 15 January to 7 April 1993, and brought together\nnearly 1,000 delegates from all regions and all social strata\nof the country, enabled us to lay the basis for the\nestablishment of stable democratic institutions and to ensure\nlasting peace and good management of the country\u2019s affairs.\nThis National Conference, which instilled much hope in the\nhearts of the citizens of Chad, took the following steps in\nimplementation of the Transitional Constitution: the\nPresident of the Republic, who is the guarantor of national\nsovereignty, was confirmed in office; the Prime Minister,\nwho is the elected Head of Government, was put in charge\nof implementing the programme of action; the Supreme\nCouncil of Transition, the elected legislative body, was put\nin charge of follow-up action in connection with\nimplementing the programme of action and was given the\njob of providing arbitration in the case of any disputes\noccurring during the transition.\nThe National Conference intended, through this\nrestructuring process, to give new direction to public life in\nChad, providing transparent administration in public affairs,\nfull freedom of the press and scrupulous respect for human\nrights. These indispensable corollaries of any democratic\nsystem are among the major concerns of the delegates.\nHere, the Supreme Council for Communication and the\nNational Commission on Human Rights, which will be\nestablished soon, will guarantee freedom of the press and the\nfundamental rights of citizens.\nFor all the participants in the National Conference, as\nfor all the people of Chad, the time has come to make peace,\nto seek new solutions to the country\u2019s problems, so that it\nwill be possible to achieve genuine national reconciliation\namong all the sons of Chad. The Transition Government,\nwhich I have the signal honour of heading, is making\nsustained efforts to realize these objectives. Thus, it is\ntrying to create the conditions necessary to the building of\nconfidence among the people in the future of their country.\nThe restructuring of the national army of Chad that is\nnow taking place will eventually open the way to better\ncontrol of public expenditure and will make possible the\nchannelling of the country\u2019s limited resources into the most\nproductive sectors. Nor can any democratization be\nundertaken and made stable without security services capable\nof ensuring respect for the territorial integrity of the country.\nAbove all, there is a need for a disciplined army that\nrespects the Constitution of the Republic.\nMy Government lacks the financial and other material\nmeans to succeed in this transformation of the national army\nof Chad. First and foremost we need to encourage elements\nof the army from the outset by financing projects for\nmilitary reconversion and for reintegration into civilian life.\nIn that connection, we warmly thank the French Republic for\nits assistance over the past three years. I wish also to renew\nour appeal to all countries that wish Chad to be genuinely\ntransformed to help us with all possible assistance in this\ndifficult task.\nBeyond the question of the success of the\ndemobilization operation is the question of the future of\ndemocracy in Chad. Our democracy will be unable to\nwithstand for long the many pressures resulting from all the\nvarious problems besetting our country.\nHence, my country is working tirelessly to conclude\nagreements of reconciliation with the remaining opposition\npolitico-military organizations. My Government is\ndeveloping initiatives in the area of human rights, bolstering\nfreedom of the press and establishing political parties and\ncivic organizations. Despite that progress, cases of human\nrights violations continue in my country. This proves, if\nproof were needed, that it takes time to change ways of\nthinking, no matter what the clear will of the highest\nnational authorities may be.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 5\nThere is no lack of obstacles for any young democracy.\nAs it is said, democracy, poverty and insecurity are not good\nneighbours. At the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, my delegation drew attention to my country\u2019s\nprecarious economic situation. Apart from problems linked\nto uneven rainfall over our territory, to the threat of locusts\nand to fluctuations in the world economic situation, our\neconomy is experiencing difficulties linked to poor\nadministration. The resources of the State are insufficient to\npay salaries and growing military expenditures. There is no\nguarantee that we will be able to afford the cost of materials\nand State contributions for investment in priority projects\nrelating to infrastructure, health and education.\nThe basic imbalances that characterize financial\nmanagement in Chad - which explain the continued\ndeterioration of our country\u2019s social fabric - reflect those in\nother Central African economies covered by the Central\nAfrican Customs and Economic Union (CACEU). Those\ncountries had achieved notable growth in 1985, but since\nthen have been in an unprecedented crisis. In the\ncircumstances, my country - current Chairman of the\nCACEU Council of Heads of State - fully subscribes to the\nplan for subregional adjustment and economic recovery\ndrawn up by the Central African States Development Bank,\nand hopes to benefit from the greater understanding and\nsupport of the international community. That support will\ngive our Government a sound basis on which to implement,\nas it has declared its wish to do, a consistent programme of\nmacroeconomic adjustment and structural reform, with the\nsupport of bilateral and multilateral donors.\nAlready we can say that the major thrust of the reforms\nwill be in the areas of improved public financing, the\nresumption of productive activities through reductions in the\ncost of the elements of production, rationalization of\nmanagement, elimination of arrears in State debt, the\npromotion of a well-functioning private sector, and the\nimplementation of monetary, fiscal, customs and institutional\nmeasures drawn up within the subregional framework of\nCACEU and the customs zone.\nMy country, which has experienced the throes of war,\ncannot remain insensitive to the many conflicts that are\ntearing today\u2019s world apart, claiming innocent lives\neverywhere. In Africa, we are concerned at the exacerbation\nof the situation in Somalia and Angola. Chad hopes that the\nfirm position adopted by the United Nations on those two\nconflicts will help make those most responsible for the\ntragedies respect agreements they have signed.\nWith respect to Mozambique, we are following with\ninterest the peace process under way in that country, and we\nurge the two parties to cooperate fully and in a\nstraightforward way to achieve peace. We also welcome the\npeace process that has begun in Rwanda, Liberia and South\nAfrica, where in the months to come multiparty negotiations\nwill lead to general elections, which we hope will be free\nand transparent.\nIn the Middle East, the signature of a declaration of\nprinciples on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho and\nmutual recognition by the Palestine Liberation Organization\nand the State of Israel give us hope that the peoples of that\nregion will at last be able to live in peace. Dialogue and\ncooperation should guide future relations among the peoples\nof the region.\nChad is convinced that only dialogue can restore peace\nto Central and Eastern Europe; we fully subscribe to the\naction taken by the international community to bring about\na just and peaceful settlement of all the conflicts raging\nthere.\nToday\u2019s world economy is characterized by a structural\ncrisis in the developed countries and by increasingly delayed\ndevelopment in the developing countries, particularly those\nof Africa. My country welcomes the convening of the\ninternational conference on African development, which is\nnow under way on the initiative of the Government of Japan.\nWe hope that the results of that meeting will be positive for\nAfrica. On behalf of my Government, I convey deep\ngratitude to the Japanese Government for its initiative.\nMy delegation hopes that the restructuring and\nrevitalization of the economic and social structure of the\nUnited Nations will contribute to strengthening the\nOrganization\u2019s capacity to act.\nMy delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that only\ndialogue and cooperation will enable us to overcome the\nnumerous obstacles to the establishment of peace and\nharmony among peoples.\nIt is in that spirit that my country has appealed to the\nInternational Court of Justice to settle its border dispute with\nthe Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Both parties\nhave committed themselves to respect the judgment.\nMembers will know from my remarks that my country\nis passing from a long, dark night of instability, dictatorship,\nhuman rights violations and economic set-backs. They will\nalso know that the heroic struggle of the people of Chad has\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nled it onto the path of democracy; we want at all costs to\nstay on that road. My delegation affirms that forcefully.\nMy people earnestly desires to make achievements\nleading to a major recovery in its political, economic and\nsocial situation, and has adopted an ambitious programme of\nchange, which we did not have the means to implement fully\nin the six months remaining in the transition period. As they\ntirelessly pursue implementation, my country\u2019s officials\nintend to focus all their efforts on certain pivotal objectives,\nwhich I shall enumerate now.\nFirst, we must ensure unswerving respect for human\nrights by guaranteeing the security of citizens; we must\nensure freedom of communication, along with all individual\nfreedoms and, above all, respect for the value of human life.\nWe must banish the concept of impunity from our judicial\nsystem. To that end, and to ensure the safety of our citizens\nthrough a major reorganization of the police, we require\nsupport from the international community both in devising\nthe action to be taken and in providing the means to do so.\nMy Government\u2019s second objective is the holding of\nfree, open and democratic elections.\nThe social crisis we have just described is creating\ninextricable problems for my Government, problems with\nserious and pressing implications. A country cannot be\ngoverned when there is constant pressure from the streets,\nnor can decisive efforts be focused on carrying out economic\nrecovery if there is not a Government elected on the basis of\na programme containing needed beneficial measures and if\nit does not have the support - or at least the understanding -\nof the people with regard to an economic and social plan.\nThus, our Government intends to work on preparing for and\nholding free, open and democratic elections within the time-\nframe set out in the recommendations of the Sovereign\nNational Conference. Here too, and above all, we will need\nthe support of the international community.\nOn that note, in evoking the basic aspiration of my\npeople, I shall leave this rostrum today, having transmitted\nmy country\u2019s message of peace to the international\ncommunity. Our aspiration to democratic change is, I feel,\nrealistic and its implementation is, I believe, inevitable.\nLong live peace and dialogue between peoples!\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, Sir,\non behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola and\non my own behalf, I congratulate Ambassador Insanally\n48 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwarmly on his unanimous election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I am\nconvinced that his proven experience and dedication to the\nnoble ideals of our Organization constitute a secure\nguarantee of the success of this session.\nTo Mr. Stoyan Ganev, his predecessor, I should like to\nexpress my sincere gratitude for his exemplary and unselfish\nmanner of directing the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. The results we obtained during that session are\nundeniable testimony to his valiant contribution in the search\nfor just and lasting solutions to the grave problems with\nwhich we are confronted.\nWe are very pleased to welcome the new Members of\nour Organization. Their admission confirms the universal\nvocation of the United Nations at a time when its actions are\nfelt all over the world.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nI also want to express my Government\u2019s satisfaction at the\ndevotion and energy he has shown during the first year of\nhis difficult mandate, whose principal objective was the\nconstant search for adequate solutions to the problems that\nafflict all mankind. We would not be wrong to say that\nunder his leadership concrete and decisive steps have already\nbeen taken towards the resolution of certain issues that\nseemed too difficult to resolve.\nIn this context we salute his efforts, within the\nframework of the restructuring and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations system, to give the system a new vitality in\nthe fulfilment of its mission. We also support the\nmechanisms established for the prevention of conflict, as\nexplained in the report entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\",\nwhose sub-title includes the words \\\"Preventive diplomacy\\\".\nMy Government continues to support such initiatives and\ncommends the United Nations for the General Assembly\u2019s\nunanimous adoption of resolution 47/120 B at its forty-\nseventh session on 20 September 1993.\nTherefore, the restructuring and revitalization of our\nOrganization should include reform of the Security Council\nso that it can respond to the realities of today\u2019s world. We\nunderstand that restructuring the Security Council -\nspecifically its enlargement - so that it can permit equitable\nrepresentation of all the regions of the globe is aimed at\nguaranteeing greater representativeness, credibility and\nefficiency. We think that the time has come for the defence\nof peace and international security to be the responsibility of\nall States.\nSignificant and far-reaching achievements have occurred\nand are still occurring in international relations, after the end\nof the East-West confrontation and the cold war. These\nevents are taking place in spite of the proliferation of armed\nconflicts that put at risk the hope for peace and stability,\nconditions that are indispensable for the promotion of\nmutually advantageous international cooperation.\nWith the signing of the peace accords in Washington\nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the\nGovernment of Israel, a new era has opened up for the peace\nprocess in the Middle East. My Government commends the\nsigning of these accords and hopes that the international\ncommunity will continue to work for the rights of all the\npeople of that region, in particular so that the opportunity for\nthe Palestinian people to live in peace and freedom will be\nan irreversible reality.\nRegarding South Africa, it was with great satisfaction\nthat we heard, in the speech by Mr. Nelson Mandela in this\nHall on 24 September 1993, the announcement of the\norganization of free and democratic elections in April 1994\nand the call for the lifting of the sanctions. We also\ncommend the creation of the Transitional Executive Council,\nwhich will put an end to three centuries of white minority\ndomination. From this rostrum, my Government would like\nto add its voice in support of all the initiatives that aim for\na peaceful and negotiated solution in South Africa for the\npeaceful transition of power to the black majority.\nIn this context, my Government hopes that the\ninternational community will remain vigilant in order to\ndeter any attempt by extremist groups to derail the present\ndemocratic process, which will culminate in the\nestablishment of the right to one man, one vote, in South\nAfrica.\nWhile there has been encouraging progress with regard\nto the conflicts in the Middle East and apartheid, it is\nunfortunate that the same is not true in relation to other\nconflicts, such as those in East Timor, the former\nYugoslavia, some States of the former Soviet Union,\nSomalia, Liberia and my own country. As a matter of fact,\nthese conflicts and civil wars continue daily to kill thousands\nof human beings and to impede the social and economic\ndevelopment of the countries involved. We should like the\ninternational community, and the United Nations in\nparticular, to give more attention to the resolution of these\nconflicts, on the basis of international justice and legality.\nI should like to express our solidarity with, and\nencouragement to, the Government of Mozambique and our\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 49\nMozambican brothers and sisters, so that they may, with\ndetermination and patience, continue on the paths that will\nlead that country to a lasting and peaceful solution within the\nframework of the accords signed in Rome, whose\nimplementation should be scrupulously observed by all\ninterested parties, under the supervision of the United\nNations.\nWe welcome the positive signs which resulted from the\nrecent meeting regarding East Timor between the Ministers\nof Foreign Trade of Portugal and Indonesia, under the\nauspices of the Secretary-General.\nWe hope that this profitable dialogue will lead to a just\nsolution that takes into account the aspirations of the\nMaubere people in accordance with the relevant resolutions\nof the General Assembly and of the Security Council.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my Government\nsupports the holding of the referendum on self-determination\nfor this Territory under the terms of the resolutions of the\nOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations.\nMy Government also hopes that the existing obstacles will\nbe overcome as soon as possible.\nThere have lately been startling changes in the world\neconomic situation. This applies especially to third world\ncountries, particularly in Africa. In this regard, while we\nwitness almost linear economic growth in the developed\ncountries, a substantial decrease has been recorded in the\nless developed countries.\nThe indebtedness and the debt servicing of the less\ndeveloped countries, together with the great decrease in the\nprices of raw materials and the recession in the industrialized\ncountries, constitute the principal obstacle to their\ndevelopment and to their full participation in the world\neconomy.\nIn summary, it may be said that the socio-economic\nsituation of the developing countries - in particular, the\ncountries of Africa - is alarming and requires the assistance\nof international financial institutions.\nNevertheless, we are opposed to the doctrine that has\nbeen termed the \u00e9tats en \u00e9chec - the failed States - according\nto which these countries are not able to resolve their\nproblems by themselves and, therefore, need new \\\"tutors\\\".\nIt seems to us important that certain political situations\nthat are a legacy of the past be revised with a view to\nreaching agreement and reducing the great barriers that exist\nand the mechanisms that jeopardize real cooperation for the\neconomic, technical and scientific advancement of the\ndeveloping countries. In this context, we propose a\nrestructuring of the mechanism of international management\nfor economic development and cooperation.\nMy Government shares the opinion that a successful\noutcome to the forthcoming world conferences on economic\nand social development and on population is of great\nimportance to the international community so that there may\nbe, at the highest level, an open and frank dialogue with a\nview to finding the most equitable solutions to the most\ndiverse and burning issues concerning mankind: poverty,\nhunger and malnutrition - in a word, \\\"underdevelopment\\\" -\nthat grip a great part of our planet.\nI should like to refer also to the importance that my\nGovernment attaches to environmental issues and the\nattention that it pays to implementation of the\nrecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference of\n1992. In this context, the Government of Angola has\nestablished the post of Secretary of State for the\nEnvironment, whose purpose is to apply the\nrecommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference. In\naddition, an inter-ministerial commission, with an essentially\nconsultative role, has been set up to study and follow closely\nprojects related to the activities of the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council\u2019s Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe promotion of and universal respect for human\nrights remain the prerequisites for the strengthening of\ninternational peace and security.\nThe Republic of Angola actively participated in the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, which was held in\nVienna, and supported the consensus view. Nevertheless,\nAngola continues to believe that, in the broad sense, human\nrights are universal. We believe that there must be no\nselectivity in the observance of human rights. Nowhere\nshould human rights serve as a pretext for interference in the\ninternal affairs of sovereign States Members of the United\nNations.\nThe world and the United Nations have witnessed the\nevolution of the political situation in my country in recent\nyears - in particular, since 1988. To make possible a better\nunderstanding of the phenomena that have contributed to the\ndramatic situation in Angola, allow me to provide a brief\nhistorical overview.\n50 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe Angolan Government is ever-conscious of the\nintrinsic link between peace and socio-economic\ndevelopment, not just for Angola but for all of southern\nAfrica. My Government took the initiative of presenting a\npeace programme to the then Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations. This programme contained the principles\nthat culminated in the signing of the Accords in New York\nin December 1988. We recall that these accords provided\nfor the withdrawal of Cuban soldiers from Angola and their\nreturn to Cuba, as well as for the withdrawal of the apartheid\nforces from Angolan territory and the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the\nindependence of Namibia. At that time the international\ncommunity greeted with satisfaction the New York Accords,\nwhich opened a new era in the relations between States in\nthat region.\nWith regard to the internal conflict in Angola, the\nGovernment was aware of the fact that only domestic peace,\nachieved through dialogue and political mediation, would\nmake possible the creation of a favourable framework for a\nsolution of the conflict. Apart from its own efforts, the\nGovernment showed that it was sensitive to African\ninitiatives that sought to contribute to the restoration of\npeace in Angola.\nThus it was that, in the framework of the Government\u2019s\ninternal peace plan, we arrived in Gbadolite in June 1989.\nUnfortunately, the Accords lasted only a short time because\nUNITA\u2019s friends and allies wanted a different solution. The\nfailure of the Accords was due essentially to bad faith on the\npart of the head of UNITA.\nIn spite of this failure, the Angolan Government\ncontinued to commit itself to economic and political reforms,\nas well as to a negotiated solution of the conflict. It\ncontinued to promote genuine national reconciliation, whose\nfundamental purpose was to put an end to the conflict with\nUNITA.\nAfter New York and Gbadolite, peace negotiations\ncontinued - the Portuguese Government mediating - and the\nBicesse Accords were signed on 31 May 1991. After a\nperiod of 18 months, during which the Angolan people lived\nin relative peace, the country\u2019s first multi-party elections\nwere held on 29 and 30 September 1992.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the United Nations\nconsidered these elections to be to be free and fair.\nUNITA was not satisfied with the defeat that the\nAngolan people had inflicted on it through the ballot-box,\nand once again showed its Fascist character. It did not\nhesitate to take up arms again to take power by force. It\nresumed its previous role as a militarist organization\nincapable of conforming to democratic rules.\nJonas Savimbi\u2019s military option plunged our country\ninto a civil war that has caused incalculable loss of human\nlives, the destruction of social and economic infrastructure\nand the displacement of millions of citizens, with such\nconsequences as hunger, poverty, sickness and lack of proper\nclothing.\nAs we stated in the Security Council on 15 September\n1993, the situation in Angola is exceptionally tragic and\nrequires special attention from the international community.\nDaily, thousands of people die as a direct or indirect\nconsequence of the war. Children, elderly people and\nwomen are direct victims of these acts of war. We can\ndeclare, without fear of contradiction, that the critical\neconomic and political situation in Angola today bears no\nsimilarity whatever to the situation in Somalia, Bosnia,\nCambodia or any of the republics of the former Soviet\nUnion. It is our profound hope that peace will be restored\nto those regions.\nThe international community seems insensitive to our\ntragedy. It is as if the Angolan people were paying the price\nfor playing the democratic game. Indeed, how are we to\nunderstand the curtain of silence that envelops my country?\nA poor loser will not hesitate to defy the international\ncommunity with impunity unless it punishes him once and\nfor all. How can one explain that UNITA still maintains\noffices in certain democratic countries and that some of its\nofficials are still received with great pomp by officials who\ndo not hide their aversion to totalitarianism and are the most\nardent defenders of human rights?\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of\nAngola and of its martyred people, who are dying daily by\nthe thousands, I appeal to the United Nations and the\ninternational community from this rostrum to help my people\nand compel the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, once and for\nall to abandon his military adventurism and respect the will\nof the Angolan people, as freely expressed at the ballot\nboxes in September 1992.\nSpeaking to the Security Council last week during its\nconsideration of the evolving situation in Angola, we asked\nourselves how long that great organ, responsible for\ninternational peace and security, would permit the leader of\nUNITA to perpetrate with impunity heinous massacres that\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 51\nshock the human conscience. These acts discredit and\ndishonour the United Nations itself and the Security Council,\nwhose resolutions have been purely and simply ignored. We\nwould like to remind this Assembly that since the beginning\nof the war in Angola in October 1992 the Security Council\nhas adopted 10 resolutions condemning UNITA and\ndemanding that it abandon the military option and resume\ndialogue aimed at restoring peace.\nYet UNITA has met neither demand. Worse yet, in\nreaction to Security Council resolution 864 (1993) of 15\nSeptember 1993, which provides for the imposition of\nsanctions, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi attempted once\nagain to dupe international public opinion and the Security\nCouncil by declaring a false cease-fire and stipulating\nconditions at variance with the spirit and letter of the\nBicesse Accords, the Abidjan Protocol and the electoral\nresults.\nThe truth, however, is quite different. Not only was the\nunilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA not respected, but\nwe witnessed an increase in military operations throughout\nour national territory. As a result, fighting in Kuito and\nother regions has recently intensified in a desperate UNITA\nattempt to reoccupy new areas and consolidate its position.\nMoreover, by making new proposals outside the negotiating\nframework, Savimbi revealed his obvious intention to ignore\nthe resolutions of the Security Council and seize power for\nhimself at any cost, including the death of hundreds of\nthousands more Angolans. Savimbi does not want peace\nwithout power. Savimbi only wishes to gain time.\nObviously, the Government of Angola cannot accept the\npolicy of fait accompli that UNITA wishes to implement by\nproposing a cease-fire in situ. We believe that there is no\ngood will on UNITA\u2019s part and that it does not wish to\nestablish dialogue to put a definitive end to the war. This\narmed party is plotting a dangerous manoeuvre with the aim\nof shirking its obligation to fulfil the Bicesse Accords and\nthe resolutions of the Security Council.\nThe United Nations has a great responsibility in the\nAngolan process and must not be complacent as regards\nUNITA. It is important that the prestige of this Organization\nin the peaceful settlement of the conflict not be jeopardized\nor challenged by the irreverence of the leader of a rebel\npolitical organization. The Government of Angola, the\nUnited Nations and the troika of observers of the Angolan\npeace process have all fallen victim in succession to\nUNITA\u2019s bad faith over the past 12 months, a bad faith that\nhas characterized the behaviour of Mr. Savimbi in every\nmeeting held since the Namibe, Addis Ababa and Abidjan\nmeetings.\nIn Abidjan the Angolan Government bent over\nbackwards to be flexible. In spite of the involvement of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative\nand of the leaders of the delegations of the observer States,\nUNITA did not sign the Protocol of Understanding which\nwas negotiated and agreed upon to lead to the establishment\nof a complete cease-fire in Angola. We would like to point\nout that President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and his Minister of\nForeign Affairs have done their best in the search for a just\nsolution to the Angolan conflict. These efforts have not\nbeen successful, due solely to the obstinacy of Mr. Savimbi,\nwho says \\\"Yes\\\" one day and \\\"No\\\" the next.\nWe therefore consider that it is crucial that the\ninternational community identify the transgressor and move\nvigorously against him in Angola in an act of justice towards\nour people and Government, so that our hopes for the\nestablishment of democracy will not be frustrated in the\nmidst of the transitional process currently taking place\nthroughout the world. We want a lasting peace based on\nviable conditions for reconciling all Angolans.\nIn that context, my Government proposed, on 22\nSeptember 1993, the following conditions to resolve the\npost-electoral crisis caused by UNITA.\nFirst, UNITA must withdraw its military forces from\nthe areas they occupied illegally following the multi-party\nelections held on 29 and 30 September 1992, and must then\nobserve the cease-fire under the terms of Security Council\n851 (1993) of 15 July 1993.\nSecondly, after the declaration of a cease-fire,\nhumanitarian assistance should be implemented and the\nurgent evacuation of the wounded, sick, interested persons\nand foreigners accomplished.\nThirdly, UNITA must accept fully and unequivocally\nthe validity of the Bicesse Accords and the results of the\nelection held in September 1992.\nFourthly, UNITA must respect the legislation produced\nby the instruments of sovereignty established by the\nelections.\nThe Angolan Government reiterates its willingness to\nresume negotiations as soon as the conditions for those\nnegotiations have been established.\n52 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn my statement to the Security Council on 15\nSeptember 1993 I alerted its members to the crimes\ncommitted by UNITA against defenceless civilian\npopulations. These crimes range from the cold-blooded\nmurder of medical personnel and hospital patients, and the\nhunting down and physical elimination of journalists, family\nmembers of Government officials and UNITA dissidents to\nthe bombardment of cities by long-range guns and missiles.\nI also had the opportunity to discuss the situation prevailing\nin some regions of Angola, where, as in Kuito, the\npopulation has had to eat the flesh of human corpses in\norder to survive. UNITA has encircled Kuito for more than\neight months and does not allow humanitarian assistance to\nbe distributed to the population or allow foreigners to leave\nthe areas in which they found themselves when the war\nresumed.\nIn Somalia, one warlord, General Mohammed Aidid,\nhas been labelled an undesirable person by the United\nNations. An international arrest warrant was issued for that\nSomali leader. Several days ago the General Assembly\nelected a group of international jurists whose mandate is to\njudge those accused of war crimes allegedly committed in\nthe former Yugoslavia. And what is to be said of Jonas\nSavimbi?\nAre the crimes that are being committed in Angola\nunder Mr. Savimbi\u2019s order not worse than those which the\nUnited Nations has attributed to General Aidid or the crimes\nthat it intends to judge in the former Yugoslavia? The\nmurder of medical personnel and patients in hospitals; the\nhunting down and execution of journalists; family members\nof Government leaders and dissidents from UNITA, Jonas\nSavimbi\u2019s organization; the incineration of political\nadversaries in huge bonfires; the indiscriminate\nbombardment of cities with long-range guns and missiles;\nand UNITA\u2019s ties with the forces of apartheid - what does\nall this mean? Are these not crimes against humanity?\nThe sanctions that the Security Council decreed and\nwhich entered into force on 25 September constitute proof\nof the commitment of the international community to the\nAngolan conflict. We hope that these signs will be\nhonoured by Mr. Savimbi and his allies so that dialogue can\nbe resumed as soon as possible, on the basis of the Bicesse\nAccords, the Abidjan Protocol and on fulfilment of\nparagraphs 6 and 12 of Security Council resolution 851\n(1993).\nIn conclusion, I should like once again, on behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Angola, to express our\nprofound gratitude for the wide range of support the\ninternational community has provided to alleviate the\nsuffering of our people. We hope this assistance will\ncontinue in an even more substantial way. We wish to pay\nhere a special debt of gratitude to the humanitarian\norganizations and in particular the World Food Programme,\nwhich, in spite of UNITA\u2019s irresponsible and criminal\nactions, has continued its operations, risking the lives of its\nown personnel.\nWe express also our gratitude to the countries that in\ndiverse ways have given humanitarian assistance to the\npeople, who still are in need of it now.\nOnce again, I wish the President every success in the\nwork of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nand hope that its results will contribute to the strengthening\nof international peace and cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to express our\nwarmest congratulations to Guyana and to you personally,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session.\nI am also pleased that in the past year the United\nNations family has grown to include the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\nAndorra, Monaco and Eritrea. We wish to extend a special\nwelcome to the last two in view of our long-standing historic\nand human ties.\nItaly, deeply committed to European political and\neconomic unity, shares the views expressed by the Belgian\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, who is the current Chairman of\nthe European Council.\nWe are not simply voicing conventional wisdom if we\nstress the depth of the transformations that define the times\nin which we live. Every day brings forth new proof that the\nend of the cold war has brought us to a watershed. We must\ncarefully decipher the lessons and courageously shoulder the\nnew tasks with which this moment has presented us.\nAs the Secretary-General said in Milan, international\nlaw is the main instrument at our disposal; it is not merely\na regulatory instrument but the very language of the relations\nbetween States. But the social pressures we are now facing\nare profoundly new, generating changes that international\nlaw must begin to reflect as it translates new needs into new\ninstitutions.\nIf today we believe we can govern this transformation,\nand if we refuse to yield to the disorderly growth of a new\ninternational order, we have first and foremost the renewed\nvitality and prominence of the United Nations to thank.\nThe United Nations has evolved on the foundation of\npractices that are solidly inscribed in the Charter, while\ndiscovering new ways to pursue its aims. Take\npeace-keeping, a practice from the United Nations earliest\ndays that has recently acquired a special role. Today peace\nis more likely to be threatened by the explosion of internal\nconflicts (though at times with transnational components)\nthan by acts of open aggression across international borders.\nPeace-keeping, peace-enforcement, and humanitarian relief\nmissions all take place in the midst of conflicts with\ncomplex political causes, and tangled ethnic and national\nroots. In such an environment, the traditional juxtaposition\nof diplomacy and military action no longer corresponds to\nthe reality of the present, and a broad initial mandate is not\nsufficient concretely to define operations in the field.\nThe unity of military command is an unquestionable\nprinciple, without which no operation can succeed.\nHowever, the political management of an operation cannot\nbe confined strictly to military options, especially when the\nreal issue is not the legitimacy of the use of force (which\nmay be clearly authorized by the Security Council\u2019s\nmandate), but its advisability and timing in view of the\npolitical objectives. I would add that in situations involving\ncrowds of civilians, we must consider making it our policy\nalways to give pride of place to the use of non-lethal\nanti-riot equipment. This is not only an Italian concern.\nSpokesmen for other countries have also stressed that\ncountries contributing troops to United Nations\npeace-keeping missions need mechanisms that would exempt\ntheir troops from passively abiding by orders that may be\nillegal, inconsistent, or in contradiction with the aims of the\noperation.\nThe United Nations peace-keeping practices reveal an\nawareness of the need for adequate prior consultation of\ntroop-contributing countries. To this end, while Article 29\nof the Charter provides a general guideline for the\nestablishment of bodies subsidiary to the Security Council,\nArticle 44 could provide a more fitting solution to the\nproblem. It provides for the Security Council to establish\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nconsultative procedures with non-members of the Security\nCouncil that have been requested to contribute troops to\npeace-keeping and security operations. Today, even in the\nabsence of formal agreements such as those provided for by\nArticle 43, I believe we should extend Article 44, by\nanalogy, to operations conducted under Chapter VII of the\nCharter.\nIn his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", the Secretary-General\ndefined peace-building as laying the necessary political and\nsocio-economic foundations for a lasting peace after the\nphase of open conflict has ended. The reconstruction - or\nthe establishment - of legal and economic institutions in\ncritical areas and countries represents the main prerequisite\nof an enduring peace.\nThese premises form the basis of what Italy means to\npropose in order to move beyond the current situation in\nSomalia - a situation characterized somewhat by giving pride\nof place to the military aspect of the United Nations\nOperation in Somalia (UNOSOM) and by the standstill in\nthe political process. We believe that it is essential that the\nUnited Nations step up its political efforts at peacemaking by\nappointing a personality of great international prestige to\nrenew the political and diplomatic initiative with all the\nSomali factions. At the same time, the mechanisms of the\nAddis Ababa Conference should be reactivated in such a\nway as to increase the involvement of the African nations\nand their institutions in the normalization of Somalia. But\nthe predominantly political nature of our operation to restore\nhope in Somalia must also be translated into the progressive\nreconstruction of Somalia\u2019s basic economic and social\nstructures and the reorganization of a government and its\nadministrative structures. This requires broad development\nprogrammes, to which Italy\u2019s commitment has remained\nunswerving even in the most difficult moments.\n\nItaly welcomes the renewed central role of the United\nNations, and at the same time supports a reform of its\ninstitutional mechanisms.\nLet us first consider the possibility of a change in the\nmembership of the Security Council. As Italy emphasized\nto the Secretary-General last June, since the Security Council\nis moving towards a future of greater burdens and\nresponsibilities, its representativeness and effectiveness must\ndevelop in parallel. What we suggest is that, in addition to\nthe permanent members with veto power and the\nnon-permanent members, a third category be established. It\nwould be made up of countries able to make a special\ncontribution to achieving the objectives of the United\nNations. What matters is not drawing up controversial lists,\nbut identifying objective criteria for selection, based on\neconomic factors, human resources, culture, and mass\ncommunications. These countries would rotate two at a\ntime, thereby becoming semi-permanent members of the\nCouncil.\nWe must all recognize the renewed central role of the\nUnited Nations in international relations, but avoid\ninterpreting this role in exclusive terms.\nThe regional dimension of multilateralism, which is\ndescribed in Chapter VIII of the Charter, has today a great\nrole. Take the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE), which has been explicitly defined as a\nregional institution on the basis of the United Nations\nCharter. Italy is about to assume the chairmanship of the\nCSCE. We believe that it is being called on to play an\nincreasing role, mainly in preventive diplomacy but also in\npeace-keeping and in fostering negotiated settlements. In\nthis regional framework, we would welcome more stringent\nregulations on arms transfers that build on the present United\nNations provisions.\nIf it is true that without peace there can be neither\ndevelopment nor satisfaction of social needs, it is also true\nthat conflict is fed everywhere not only by the urge to\nsubjugate the adversary violently but also by the existence of\nsocial injustice, imbalance and poverty.\nThe first and basic injustice is the violation of human\nrights. When the international community defends human\nrights, it is pursuing absolute and autonomous values that\nmust be protected. At the same time, it is eradicating many\nof the causes of violence between groups and nations.\nWe hope that an agreement between the groups will\nfinally make it possible to end the fighting in Bosnia.\nHowever, as the international community prepares to support\nthe implementation of an agreement, we must not forget the\nwar crimes and the crimes against humanity committed\nduring this tragic conflict. Thus, we applaud the\nestablishment of the International Tribunal and hope that -\nimpartial and free from political influences - it will begin its\nwork at the earliest possible date. Where appropriate, the\nTribunal should hand down tough sentences, although I take\nexception to the death sentence, which Italy firmly opposes\non the basis of its time- honoured juridical traditions.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 17\nI wonder if the international community could not\nsummon the same determination to establish an international\ncriminal court to prosecute the most serious human rights\nviolations.\nItaly is convinced that human rights prosper in systems\nbased on democracy and an open-market economy. That is\nwhy we firmly support Governments that are committed to\nsuch goals and work courageously through hardships and\ntemporary crises.\nAn issue of great contemporary relevance is the\nprotection of minorities - which cannot be separated from\nthe protection of individuals, for the two issues are based on\nthe same hopes, the same principles of freedom and the\nsame respect for cultural, religious and philosophical\ndifferences. Too often, the territorial integrity of the State\nhas been contrasted with the rights of minorities. Instead,\nwe must demonstrate that in a democracy, a democracy that\nleaves room for direct participation and for true pluralism of\nidentity and choice, it is possible to balance these two\nequally worthy values. We must demonstrate that there is\nno contradiction between the protection of minorities and the\nstability of borders. On the contrary, as the experience of\nmy country shows, they can reinforce each other.\nThe principles, institutions and rights that make peace\nmore solid are a primary consideration. But we must never\nunderestimate the often-decisive role played by weapons.\nThe accumulation and development of weapons endangers\nstability since the perception of a threat triggers actions that\nare harmful for peace and economically ruinous.\nThat is why disarmament and non-proliferation, even in\nthe post-cold-war era, must remain one of our main\nobjectives and why we highly value the message delivered\nfrom this podium by the President of the United States.\nWe need to complete past disarmament initiatives that\nwe have agreed to and begun, and both confirm and expand\nexisting tools. We strongly support the early ratification of\nthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II). The\nNon-Proliferation Treaty must be strictly observed, which is\nwhy North Korea\u2019s unclear attitude towards that Treaty is a\nmatter of such great concern. That Treaty must also be\nstrengthened and made universal. In 1995, we should all\njoin together to renew the Treaty unconditionally and for an\nindefinite period.\nToday we are witnessing the emergence of a collective\nconsciousness, the expansion of a shared system of values,\nan international citizenship based on common, objective\ninterests and the spread of more uniform lifestyles. An\nItalian philosopher, Giambattista Vico, wrote:\n\\\"Ultimately, once the cities got to know each other,\nhaving shared dealings in war, alliances and trade, they\ncame, to an unprecedented extent, to the recognition of\nnatural civic rights as a natural right of all peoples, that\nis of all united nations - as if the world were one large\ncity - which is the law of humankind.\\\"\nThat was written in the early eighteenth century.\nFaced with a world beset by multiple conflicts, in\nwhich individual nations or groups often pursue their\ninterests through the use of force, it would be intellectually\ndishonest and morally reprehensible to adopt attitudes of\nresignation or fatalism. Violence is no more natural than\npeaceful coexistence and collaboration between peoples and\ngroups. Acting against violence and for coexistence is\ntherefore not only morally desirable, but actually practicable.\nOne such possibility has been eloquently demonstrated\nin recent days by the hopeful development of a peaceful\nfuture in the Middle East thanks to the courage of the\nIsraelis, the Palestinians and the Arab countries. As a\nMediterranean country with a long tradition of active\ninvolvement in the cause of stability and peace in the area,\nItaly is ready to contribute further to help the entire region\ntake the first steps on a long and complex journey toward\npeace and cooperation, with borders permanently defined in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. The same\npossibility is confirmed by the promising steps being taken\ntowards democracy and coexistence in South Africa.\nThe awareness of the possibility and the moral duty to\nact must also inspire our attitude towards the economic and\nsocial problems that dehumanize the lives of millions of\npeople all over the world. I am referring to development\npolicies, which should be conducted in a spirit of solidarity\nand on the basis of multilateral coordination. Such\ncoordination must also be extended to bilateral initiatives,\nwhile we also need closer cooperation between agencies.\nThat approach has already produced successful results in\nMozambique and Eritrea, and even in war-torn Somalia. It\nmust now be applied to endorse the peace process in the\nMiddle East. The donors\u2019 conference about to open in\nWashington will provide an important occasion to translate\nour political support into action.\nWe know the limits of our actions, and we cannot allow\nourselves to be swayed by the temptations of noble but\nabstract Utopias. It is our responsibility to draw up\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nprinciples and instruments that are valid for the times in\nwhich we live and that can help us to manage and to\ntransform in a more rational and humane way the reality that\nsurrounds us.\nEach country must promote this action on its own or\nthrough alliances or other groups. But it is ultimately here,\nin the framework of this Organization and in view of its\nuniversal aims and membership, that each country will have\nto contribute to the solution of these problems. To do this,\nwe must not limit ourselves to declaring principles but,\nrather, on the basis of those principles we must be willing to\nhand the United Nations the tools it needs. The international\ncommunity - in other words, we as Member States - is\ngiving the United Nations greater and greater responsibilities.\nBut the responsibilities of the United Nations are our\nresponsibilities. The problems of the United Nations are our\nproblems.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate you sincerely, Sir,\non behalf of our Latin American and Caribbean region, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly at\nits forty-eighth session.\nSome nations, like Nicaragua, are in transition from war\nto peace. We are in the process of shaking off an\ninheritance of 50 years of right-wing dictatorship and\n10 years of left-wing dictatorship. At the same time, we are\nmoving from a centralized economy to a social market\neconomy. Each one of these three transitions is an\nenormous challenge requiring fluid and timely international\npolitical and economic cooperation.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 11\nNicaragua is a special case. My country has had to\nendure this triple transition. We are overcoming a post-war\nera, building democracy and restoring our economy\u2019s\nstrength and dynamism, all in the midst of a polarized\nsociety. I sincerely believe that few societies in\ncontemporary history have had to confront so many\nchallenges at the same time and in such difficult\ncircumstances.\nThe Governments and organizations that have been\nfollowing closely the critical situation in which I found my\ncountry when I took office - with a gross national product\nsimilar to that of an economy of the 1940s and an\nunprecedented rate of hyperinflation - can easily understand\nthe magnitude of our efforts.\nWe need to build a democracy, reconstruct a wounded\nsociety and compete economically with the world, all while\nfollowing an economic adjustment plan that leaves us no\nresources for social investment. There is hunger in my\ncountry. There is hatred. There are many weapons. But\nthere is also an absolute desire to build a society at peace.\nNicaragua has been a symbol of war and of hope in this\ndecade. Nicaragua should continue to be a symbol of hope.\nWe will achieve this only with international assistance.\nWith great effort, we have limited inflation to\n3.5 per cent annually, but with such difficulty that we were\nable to achieve economic growth of only 0.2 per cent in\n1992, after eight years of a falling gross national product.\nI recognize that the international community has tried\nto understand the immense complexity of our process. In\n1990, the General Assembly granted Nicaragua special\ntreatment, and called upon the international community to\nprovide us with effective and timely support. Since then,\nmy country has fulfilled all agreements and commitments\nundertaken with multilateral institutions and the international\ncommunity. We are engaged in creating the necessary\nconditions so that private, national and international\ninvestment can contribute to the economic growth of the\ncountry and hence initiate the reconstruction process and the\nsustained development needed by Nicaragua.\nAfter paying for oil imports and external debt, my\nGovernment has received international assistance amounting\nto an average of less than $12 million a year, which does not\ncover the costs of such a difficult and complex transition.\nOur economy has stabilized; however, this has been a slow\nprocess and it does not satisfy the aspirations of an\nimpoverished people demanding the attainment, in a short\nperiod of time, of levels of well-being that they deserve.\nThe economic problem is our greatest source of\ninstability, because it creates tensions in the political and\nsocial environment, jeopardizing national and regional\nstability. If foreign aid arrives late, if strong conditions are\nplaced on it or it becomes a political tool, as happened in\n1992 and is happening now, democracy in Nicaragua could\ncollapse.\nMy country depends on the financial support of the\ninternational community. Our exports are equivalent to only\n$250 million a year, and we need $850 million to finance\nour imports and service our inherited external debt.\nI have come to the General Assembly, to this forum of\nfraternal nations, to ask the international community to\ncontinue helping Nicaragua. We need the United Nations to\nhelp us to maintain and to guarantee economic bilateral\ncooperation at current levels for my country. We need\nadditional resources to reactivate economic production and\ngrowth, to strengthen the creation of social networks and to\nrenew the process of conciliation.\nWe must not forget that on 25 February 1990, to the\nsurprise of the entire international community, we held the\nfirst free and participatory elections in all the history of my\ncountry. On that day, Nicaraguans laid down their weapons\nand we all celebrated the triumph of peace, aware that we\nwere choosing the path of democracy, freedom, peace and\nrespect for human rights.\nWhen the time came to vote, every citizen voted against\ndecades of violence and bloodshed, and as we voted, we\nthought about erasing from our minds the sad images of\n10 years of war, the orphans, the widows and the maimed.\nWe voted in the determination to put an end to the tragic\nparade of soldiers, many of them children, combatants in a\nwar between brothers.\nThis was my first mandate: to generate a policy of\nnational reconciliation; not an easy task in a society\naccustomed to political polarization and to confrontation.\nToday, three years later, I continue to be committed to\npursuing national dialogue as the only viable way to solve\nour problems. The call to achieve this national\nunderstanding has been met with solidarity and support from\ncountries and international organizations.\nIn the national dialogue, we rely on the presence, which\ngreatly enhances the validity of the process, of\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nrepresentatives of the Presidents of Central America, a\nregion that can envision its future only in the larger prospect\nof integration and unity with Nicaragua.\nThe sincere gratitude of my people and Government\ngoes to my Central American colleagues, to the\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the Organization\nof American States, to the Catholic Church and to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, who have\ncontributed so much to peace and reconciliation in\nNicaragua.\nI especially wish to thank the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations for his support in the formation of an active\ngroup of donor countries, friends of Nicaragua, which,\nwithin the context of the United Nations, will help us\nidentify our requirements for external cooperation and the\nmeans for channelling this necessary assistance.\nI believe that countries in transition from war to peace,\nwhich have signed international agreements to attain total\npacification, democracy and reconstruction, should have\naccess to a special fund to enable them to stand again on\ntheir own feet and go forward.\nNicaragua and other countries in Latin America, such\nas Haiti and El Salvador, need exceptional treatment because\nwe cannot compete with nations that have not suffered the\npain of the political, economic and social destruction caused\nby war.\nWhen we appeal to the international community, we do\nso in the conviction that the principal efforts for the\nreconstruction of our country are our own responsibility as\nNicaraguans, as the actors in our own development. The\nGovernment of which I am President assumes this level of\nresponsibility in order to prevent our democracy from\nregressing. I reaffirm once more before the Assembly the\ncommitment I made to the Nicaraguan nation not to rest\nuntil democracy has been consolidated.\nI shall continue to work to ensure that freedom of\nexpression, assembly and association are never again\nrestricted. My commitment to human rights is firm and\nunalterable.\nMy decision to achieve the institutionalization of the\narmed forces in Nicaragua is irreversible. For that reason,\nin addition to drastically reducing my country\u2019s army, I am\nintroducing reforms and laws that will guarantee the total\nsubordination of the military to civilian authority and clearly\nestablish fixed terms of office in the upper echelons.\nWe are in the process of building a democratic\ninstitutional structure, including a small, professional,\nnon-partisan army at the service of the nation as a whole.\nSimilarly, we are making great efforts to disarm civilian\ngroups and to prevent the thousands of weapons already\nconfiscated from being used once again to undermine\nNicaragua\u2019s democratic achievements and so undermine the\nregional stability of Central America. Weapons confiscated\nby our authorities are burned in public for all to see.\nIn consultation with other countries of the international\ncommunity, my Government has decided to host in our\ncapital city of Managua, in May 1994, the second\ninternational conference on new and restored democracies.\nWe want to share experiences, closely examine the structures\nof the new democracies and adopt proposals that will\ncontribute to their self-betterment.\nThe United Nations must respond positively to the\nchanges in the world today. Nicaragua supports recognition\nby the United Nations of the rights of the Republic of China -\nTaiwan. We believe it is only right to recognize the\nfundamental rights of the 21 million people who live on that\nterritory. Nicaragua firmly supports this noble initiative.\nFinally, I share the joy of all our countries at the\nhistoric signing of the declaration of principles between the\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. This agreement clearly demonstrates that\npeace is possible when the will for dialogue and negotiation\nexists. It should serve as one of the great lessons of our\ntimes and a source of new hope for global peace.\nWe Nicaraguans trust in God, in the solidarity of\nfriendly nations and in cooperation by international\norganizations; the generous, fraternal, sincere hand they\nstretch out to us will enable the Nicaraguan people to\nachieve the new society of which it dreamt when it voted in\nour general elections on 25 February 1990.\nWe in Nicaragua know that the century that is coming\nto an end leaves us some hard lessons. Yet it allows us to\nface with courage the great challenges that will enable us to\nconsolidate a world society inspired by peace, freedom and\nprogress. For that reason, on the threshold of the new\ncentury, I would like to reaffirm, in the name of the\nNicaraguan people, our deep commitment to contribute to\nthe development of a more prosperous and more just world\norder. That is the commitment I make to democracy and to\nall the peoples of the world.\n"

We declared our interest in\nthe fastest possible integration, together with other countries\nof the Visegrad Four, in such effective Euro-Atlantic\npolitical, security and economic organizations as the\nEuropean Community, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and the Western European Union.\nSlovakia is building its statehood on civic principles\nbased on respect for individual rights. The objective of the\nSlovak Republic as a multi-ethnic State is to create a\nfunctioning system of ethnic coexistence and guarantees of\nequal rights and opportunities for all.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nThe tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of\nGeorgia alert us to inconsiderate and irresponsible attempts\nto gain political capital from nationalistic sentiments. We\nare against steps, regardless of their motivation, that would\nultimately lead to the creation of ethnically pure territories\nand States and that would question or endanger the peaceful\ncoexistence of populations of different ethnic origins. We\napply the existing international norms regulating such\npeaceful coexistence and we favour their further elaboration.\nWe support the idea of adopting a generally binding\ndocument on the rights of persons belonging to national,\nethnic and other minorities in the United Nations, the CSCE\nand the Council of Europe. We are convinced that such a\ndocument must equally respect the territorial integrity of\nStates and the principle of inviolability of existing borders.\nOur economic policy aims to build a balanced and\nprosperous economy based on market principles. Thus far\nthe reform measures have not brought the expected\neconomic revival. The economic difficulties are aggravated\nby various internal and external factors, among others the\nconversion of the armaments industry. The 1990 decision on\na far-reaching conversion led to the reduction of Slovakia\u2019s\nmilitary production to an unprecedented 9 per cent of the\n1989 level. This political decision to close a whole major\nbranch of Slovak industry without the necessary preparation\nfor a real conversion, though highly moral, did not take into\naccount its economic and social consequences.\nIf we are to attain the necessary economic growth, we\nneed access to the markets of developed nations, something\nwhich is increasingly complicated - all the more so because\nof the economic recession. We are convinced that\nprotectionism is not a solution. We hope that negotiations\non the further liberalization of world trade will be successful,\nin particular the negotiations of the current Uruguay Round\nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\nWe also feel encouraged by clear expressions of a\npolitical will to reform and remove export controls inherited\nfrom the cold war period that now unfairly burden legitimate\ncommerce and unduly restrain growth and opportunities, as\nrecently stated by President Clinton before this body.\nIncidentally, on this very day, Slovak representatives\nare signing an association agreement between the Slovak\nRepublic and the European Community in Luxembourg.\nThe association agreement, which we consider the first step\nin our efforts to gain full membership in the Community,\nalso reflects the general direction of our foreign policy. It\nencourages further positive development in our country, and\nwe believe that it will help us resolve some of the\naforementioned economic problems.\nThe international community is daily confronted with\nsuch tragedies as that in Bosnia and Herzegovina or\nTajikistan, with countries at the crossroads, such as Russia\ntoday, but happily also with encouraging developments, such\nas those in the Middle East and in South Africa.\nIt is only natural that the United Nations adapt itself to\nthe increased tasks in its mission as the guardian of\ninternational peace and security. To manage the ever-\nincreasing load of responsibilities more effectively, it is\nnecessary to pay attention to early warning and preventive\naction at an early stage. Equally demanding our attention\ntoday is the phase of post-conflict peace-building and\nrestoration as a basis for preventing the renewal of conflicts.\nRegarding the peace-keeping operations of the United\nNations, common experience urges us to require\nimprovements in their planning and execution. Every\noperation should have clearly defined political objectives, an\nunambiguous mandate, and an understanding of its possible\nand feasible scope and duration and of available means and\nsupport. When the Security Council sets up a new\noperation, it should define and ensure security and safety\nconditions and guarantees under which the operation is to be\ndeployed. We support the idea of a universally binding legal\ninstrument on the safety of peace-keeping operations\npersonnel. Troop-contributing countries should also have the\npossibility, through some regular mechanism, of being\nconstantly informed and consulted prior to and during the\nwhole operation.\nAnother means of enhancing the effectiveness of\npeace-keeping is increased cooperation between the United\nNations and regional arrangements, such as the Conference\non Security and Cooperation in Europe. In the Euro-Atlantic\narea, we should also seek involvement in peace-keeping of\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 11\nsuch organizations as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) or the Western European Union. All these\norganizations should be mandated in every specific case by\nthe Security Council.\nSlovakia is among the countries that have been most\nseverely afflicted by the sanctions against the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. We shall provide data on these\nlosses shortly. We believe that the effort to secure effective\neconomic assistance should not be limited to moral appeals\nto States and institutions. The economic situation of the\ncountries depending on the Danube as their main waterway\nhas been ever more aggravated by arbitrary acts of blockade\nand other violations of the respective United Nations\nresolutions and international conventions. We are convinced\nthat such acts require a clear and resolute response.\nThe decision of the Geneva Conference on\nDisarmament on a mandate for a comprehensive nuclear-test-\nban treaty is a major move in itself. It also sends a signal\nto the whole non-proliferation regime. We support the\nuniversal and indefinite extension of the non-proliferation\nTreaty. We also hope that the question of the nuclear\narsenal of the former Soviet Union will be satisfactorily and\nspeedily resolved in the spirit of non-proliferation.\nSlovakia welcomes the establishment of the United\nNations Register of Conventional Arms, which we consider\nto be a first decisive step leading to increased global\ntransparency and constraints in conventional weapons. We\nare ready to support moves towards enhanced transparency,\nas well as more detailed information on military holdings\nand procurement through national production, made under\nthe banner of the United Nations, the Conference on\nDisarmament or the Conference on Security and Cooperation\nin Europe.\nWishing to ensure full continuity with the activities of\nCzechoslovakia - an original member of the Conference on\nDisarmament - and enjoying the support of the Eastern\nEuropean regional group, the Slovak Republic applied for\nmembership in the Conference on Disarmament. A window\nof opportunity for Slovakia to become a member was opened\nby the proposal to gradually enlarge the membership of the\nConference. Those on the proposed list of 23 new members\nshould in our opinion be admitted as soon as possible.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the\nuniversality of and respect for human rights and the need for\ntheir universal application. It also, appropriately, drew our\nattention to the vital interdependency of human rights and\nsustainable development, and their bearing on international\npeace and stability. We are prepared to support steps\ntowards implementation of its recommendations. Slovakia\ntherefore encourages the establishment of a post of United\nNations high commissioner for human rights.\nRecent developments in many areas of the world where\ncivilian populations are increasingly the targets in\npredominantly non-international conflicts impel us to demand\nthat States and parties to conflicts strictly observe and\nenforce the rules and principles of international humanitarian\nlaw. We support efforts to bring those who are alleged to\nhave committed war crimes to justice, inter alia through the\nestablishment of an international criminal court.\nInternational humanitarian agencies and organizations,\nwhose activities we highly esteem and support, can attest to\nanother deplorable feature of today\u2019s world: the misuse and\neven the rejection of humanitarian assistance for political\nreasons. Those conducting humanitarian operations are\nworking under increasingly unsafe conditions. The\ninternational community should demand respect for human\nrights and humanitarian norms by the States and parties to\nconflicts. Neither should we completely ignore the fact that\nsanctions which are rightfully applied against those who\nhave breached international peace and security have a direct\nbearing on the fate and even the lives of innocent civilians.\nIn a true humanitarian spirit, we should at least try to\naddress this aspect of sanctions as well.\nFurthermore, questions related to large-scale migration,\nrefugees and displaced persons require our urgent attention.\nThe international community should set forth appropriate\nrules and standards regulating large-scale population\nmovements and seeking solutions for their root causes and\nconsequences.\nWe also feel responsible for the most vulnerable\nsegments of the world population - the women, the children,\nthe disabled and the aged. We are ready to take part in the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts to seek means for\naddressing their needs and concerns.\nThe Slovak Republic is greatly interested in reinforcing\nthe role of the United Nations and enhancing its\neffectiveness and capacity for action. We wish to join the\nranks of those States that support the implementation of the\nreform process of the United Nations in order to transform\nit into a more effective and economical organization. Its\norganizational structure should respond more adequately to\ncurrent global realities.\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSlovakia is prepared to deliberate on proposals made by\nother members of the world community, including the\nproposal to restructure the Security Council, which should\nmaintain its representativity and at the same time its\ntransparent character. We are of the opinion that countries\nsuch as Germany and Japan should be invited to assume the\nresponsibilities of permanent members of the Security\nCouncil. At the same time, the Slovak Republic observes\nthat the number of States able to contribute - owing to their\ngrowing economic influence and role in world affairs - to\nthe objectives of the United Nations is increasing. Any\ndecision on the composition of the Security Council should\nbe the result of a democratic discussion. An expansion of\nthe Security Council must not jeopardize its effectiveness\nand operational capability.\nThe General Assembly itself, in our opinion, should\nalso play a more important role within the United Nations\nsystem. The reform of the Economic and Social Council\nshould continue, with a view to avoiding duplication between\nthe Council and General Assembly agendas. Cost reductions\ncan also be made in the activities of the United Nations\nSecretariat. When this issue is considered, it should be\nborne in mind that the Secretariat executes its tasks in\nresponse to the requirements of the Member States.\nThe reform of the United Nations should be carried out\nin the context of the financial situation of the Organization.\nWe consider the change in the financing principles\nunderlying the United Nations regular budget and the budget\nof peace-keeping operations to be one of the most significant\naspects of this restructuring. The Member States should\nmeet their financial obligations to the United Nations fully\nand in due time. We believe, however, that the rules for\ndetermining the contributions of Member States to the\nUnited Nations budget should be made more flexible in\norder to accommodate changes in the economies of\nindividual Member States. The present economic reality,\nrather than history, should become the main and decisive\ncriterion.\nLet me conclude by wishing the General Assembly\nevery success in the demanding work that is ahead of it at\nthis session.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\npeople and Government of Papua New Guinea, I should like\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session. In so doing, I should like to recall - and to\nexpress my delegation\u2019s sincere appreciation for - the even-\nhanded and efficient manner in which his predecessor, Mr.\nStoyan Ganev, the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, presided\nover the Assembly at its forty-seventh session.\nHis outstanding example has maintained and thereby\nhelped to strengthen a high standard which we are confident\nMr. Insanally will match. His election brings us particular\npleasure because of the many important interests which\nGuyana shares with Papua New Guinea and the increasingly\nstrong relations which have been developing between our\ntwo countries, mainly through cooperation in the context of\nmultilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth, the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific group of Governments parties\nto the Lom\u00e9 Convention, and the United Nations itself.\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea is also pleased\nto welcome the further progress towards the universal\nmembership of the United Nations marked by the admission\nof the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, The\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and\nAndorra. We look forward to cooperating with their\nGovernments and delegations in advancing the objectives of\nthe United Nations.\nIn welcoming the new Members, I feel bound to\nobserve that my Government is concerned that other small\nStates, including a number in the South Pacific, which find\nit difficult to afford to join and send missions to the United\nNations, should be provided with the means of keeping\nabreast of developments and of having proper account taken\nof their interests, perhaps through such arrangements as a\nregional observer, as a number of Governments have\nproposed to the South Pacific Forum.\nI turn now to the proposed United Nations initiative on\nopportunity and participation. When I addressed the General\nAssembly 12 months ago, I said that I had chosen\n\\\"opportunity and participation\\\" as the main theme and goal\nof my policy as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also forecast\nthat my Government would be formally proposing an\ninitiative for the United Nations bearing the same name.\nThe proposal is now listed as item 151 on the agenda\nof the current session of the General Assembly. The\ninitiative is, of course, important for Papua New Guinea -\nopportunity and participation are, in fact, among the national\ngoals and directive principles embodied in our national\nConstitution. It is also important to other developing\ncountries where increasing opportunity for, and participation\nby, citizens is a public issue and an official aim. It is,\nmoreover, directly relevant to countries where previous\neconomic arrangements are in transition to markets. In an\nincreasingly interdependent world, where issues and ideas\noften have global implications, it should be of interest and\ncertainly deserves support worldwide.\n\nPapua New Guinea became independent on the very\nsame day, 16 September 1975, as the General Assembly\nadopted a consensus resolution - 3362 (S-VII), on\n\\\"Development and international economic co-operation\\\" -\ndirected, in the words of its first preambular paragraph, \\\"to\naccelerate the development of developing countries\\\". The\ntiming was, almost certainly, coincidental. But it is none the\nless worthy of notice because of what it suggests about the\ncircumstances, including a continuing need to achieve the\nsame aim on the part of countries such as Papua New\nGuinea both then and now.\nIn the early l990s, Papua New Guinea has been\nenjoying an unprecedented rate of economic growth,\nmeasured, in the standard terms employed by bodies such as\nthe World Bank, at something more than 9 per cent per year.\nBut few would suggest that the living standards of most of\nour people have improved at anything like the same rate.\nThe measure is quite seriously misleading, as many of us\nhave known for a very long time. But so are government\npolicies and processes of economic development that fail to\npay adequate attention to questions of distribution, including\nwho benefits and who takes part. I refer here, I should add,\nto distribution not only of Government services but of\nopenings - and even more to effective access - for people to\nbenefit by taking part in economic development.\nIn certain sectors of society in many countries,\nincluding my own, people - particularly those living in rural\nareas - are still trying to enter the cash economy for the first\ntime. In other sectors and even more countries, people who\nhave long been engaged in monetary transactions are trying\nto increase openings, access and mutually beneficial\ninteractions. Increasing opportunity and participation is, in\nmany respects, a universal goal. The urgency of the need to\naddress the means of achieving it comprehensively,\nsystematically, thoroughly and critically now arises out of\nconcern at several features of the current international\nsituation.\nThe first is the difficult and often worsening\ncircumstances of and in many developing countries. A\nsecond is the problems being encountered in the transition to\nmarkets in countries where economic arrangements were\npreviously State-centred. Another feature results from a\ntendency among economic policy-makers in widely scattered\nparts of the world, including developed countries and the\nmajor international financial institutions, during the 1980s to\nfavour reducing the economic role of the State and to leave\nquestions of access and distribution of benefits to markets.\nComplicating the effects of so-called \\\"aid fatigue\\\" in\ndeveloped countries are the increasing need and demand for\naid, investment and commercial loans arising from the\nchanges occurring in Eastern and Central Europe, the former\nSoviet Union, southern Africa and the Middle East. New\nopportunities for scarce capital and other resources are also\nopening up in the same and other areas. Furthermore,\nexpensive and urgent needs will have to be met when the\nterrible conflicts currently raging in the former Yugoslavia,\nthe Caucasus, parts of Africa and elsewhere are resolved and\nrehabilitation can get under way.\nIn other words, resumption or continuation of\ndevelopment in many parts of the world will require that\nmore must be done with less. Opportunity, access and\nbeneficial participation in economic development must be\nquite dramatically increased if living conditions are to be\nmaintained, let alone improved.\nThe proposal which the Papua New Guinea Government\nis therefore making is for the United Nations to establish a\nsmall panel of distinguished, expert and experienced persons\nbroadly representative of the international community to\nreview what has already been done and to identify options\nto increase opportunity and participation, with particular,\nthough not exclusive, reference to the economies of\ndeveloping countries. We propose not an academic study,\nbut one that draws on actual experience and makes\nrecommendations for practical action. We do not have any\nfixed ideas about what it should say. Rather, we want it to\nmake a close, critical examination of what has been\nattempted, what has been proposed and what has been - for\nwhatever reason, or for none - overlooked.\nWe emphatically do not want the project to begin with\ndoctrinaire assumptions; rather, we want it to ask questions -\nfor example, about when and how it is best for the State to\nlimit its involvement in the economy or to withdraw\ncompletely, and when and how the State should act to\nmaximize opportunity and participation. Above all, we want\nit to investigate and to provide advice on the best way of\nlinking opportunity, via effective access, to participation.\nThus, the panel, the project and the report ought to be\nmultidisciplinary in approach and scope, examining critically\nboth experiences and ideas about ways in which legal,\nadministrative, economic, social and other arrangements help\nor hinder increasing economic opportunity and participation.\nWhile the focus should be on the particular difficulties\nof developing countries, the project should, we believe, look\nfurther afield. It will, in fact, have to do so if its research\nand findings are to stimulate the world-wide information\nexchange, and, above all make the practical difference which\nwe hope will result.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3\nIn my statement to the General Assembly a year ago I\ndescribed the proposed United Nations initiative on\nopportunity and participation as being in some respects \\\"the\neconomic counterpart\\\" to the Secretary-General\u2019s most\nsuccinct and constructive report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace.\\\" It\nshould also be seen, I believe, as a complement to, and a\nnecessary filling-out of, other important United Nations\nresolutions and documents that have been concerned with\ndevelopment issues more generally, such as the reports of\nthe Pearson and Brandt Commissions, and \\\"The Challenge\nto the South\\\".\nThe panel and the report envisaged in our proposed\ndraft resolution should, in addition, be viewed as\ncomplementing and helping to fill out the Brundtland Report,\nparticularly in so far as they manage to identify options not\nonly for maintaining increased opportunity and participation,\nbut for continuing to increase them so as to allow living\nstandards to go on being raised for and by future\ngenerations.\nWhile we await publication of the Secretary-General\u2019s\neagerly anticipated report outlining an agenda for\ndevelopment, the proposed initiative on opportunity and\nparticipation should not be seen as a rival or a duplication.\nThe proposal ought to be seen instead for what it is intended\nto be, namely, a constructive start and a practical\ncontribution to setting objectives and specifying means for\ndevelopment into the twenty-first century.\nLike other supporters of the proposal, the Government\nof Papua New Guinea has been gratified by the strong and\npositive response with which the proposed United Nations\ninitiative on opportunity and participation has been greeted\nby Governments, non-governmental organizations and\ninternational bodies in diverse parts of the world.\nWe have particularly appreciated the expressions of\nsupport we have received from the Government of the\nAssembly\u2019s President, the Chairman of the General\nAssembly\u2019s Second Committee, and organizations\nparticularly concerned with advancing the common interests\nof developing countries, the Group of 77 and the Movement\nof Non-Aligned Countries.\nIn our own immediate neighbourhood, we have been\nassured of strong, individual and collective support by\nmembers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and the South\nPacific Forum, which includes the Governments of\ndeveloped countries in the region.\nWith assistance from the United Nations Development\nProgramme, my Government has convened both a national\nand a regional Workshop, in which highly respected,\nvariously experienced and diversely skilled persons gave\ntheir time on an honorary basis to help develop and refine\nthe proposal. The proceedings of both Workshops are being\ncirculated to all United Nations members.\nWhen the proposal is debated in the Assembly on 15\nNovember, we look to all members of the United Nations for\ncontributions to its further development and refinement, and,\nof course, for their votes. As it did with the resolution\n(47/441) on development and international economic\ncooperation, adopted on Papua New Guinea\u2019s independence\nday, my Government hopes that the General Assembly will\nendorse the proposed United Nations initiative on\nopportunity and participation by consensus.\nBelieving as we do in the importance of the proposed\ninitiative, but conscious of the severe strains currently\nimposed on the United Nations human and financial\nresources, and bearing in mind the recommendation made to\nall members by the Second Ministerial Meeting of the\nStanding Committee on Economic Cooperation of the\nNon-Aligned Movement, my Government has decided to\nmake a special pledge to contribute K100,000 - the\nequivalent of a little more than $102,000 - to assist in\nrealizing the proposal. While we believe that\nimplementation of the proposal must not depend on special\ndonations, we call upon others to do the same in accordance\nwith their means.\nWith regard to conferences on development and related\nissues, consistent with Papua New Guinea\u2019s obvious interest\nin development issues generally, and in those that pertain to\nsmall island countries in particular, my Government looks\nforward to the first Global Conference on Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, which is to\nbe held in Barbados in April 1994.\nWe shall remain actively involved in preparations for,\nand the proceedings of, what we regard as a most important\noccasion for sharing experiences and ideas, including both\nproblems and hopes, with island States in our own and other\nregions.\nFor closely related reasons, we also look forward to the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development, to\nbe held in Cairo in 1994.\nHaving taken a close interest in the deliberations and\noutcome of the World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna in June, we shall contribute as best we can to the\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\npreparations for the World Summit for Social Development,\nto be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference\non Women, scheduled for Beijing, both in 1995.\nI turn to the subject of apartheid and sanctions against\nSouth Africa. Successive Governments of Papua New\nGuinea have always been strongly opposed to apartheid, both\nin principle and in practice. We have consistently applied\nsanctions, backed by the force of Papua New Guinea law,\nagainst those who have upheld it. Even as apartheid has\nbeen dismantled, and progress towards a democratic,\nmulti-racial South Africa has been observed, my Government\nhas been conscious of the special perspectives and interests\nof African States. We have accordingly taken the view that\nwe would remove our sanctions against South Africa only in\nconsultation, conducted through bodies such as the\nCommonwealth and the United Nations, with such States.\nDespite the economic interests which might have been\nserved by allowing links between Papua New Guinea and\nSouth Africa, we have willingly paid the price our policy has\nrequired.\nI have been personally moved in recent days by the\naddresses made by the President of the African National\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the United Nations\nSpecial Committee against Apartheid as well as the Joint\nAssembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)\nGroup of countries and the European Community.\nFollowing the recommendations made by Mr. Mandela, the\nOrganization of African Unity and the Commonwealth\nSecretariat, as well as the resolution adopted by consensus\nin the General Assembly on Friday 8 October, my\nGovernment will now take steps to remove legally enforced\nsanctions. But in doing so we remain conscious of the\ncontinuing - and unfortunate - relevance of Mr. Mandela\u2019s\npointed reminder to the Joint Assembly of the ACP Group\nand the European Community that:\n\\\"the white minority Government and its institutions ...\nshould not be ... treated as though they were the\nrepresentative of all the people of South Africa.\\\"\nThe struggle for real equality for the African citizens of\nSouth Africa is certainly not over. In some respects, it has\nscarcely begun. My Government believes very strongly that\nthe achievement of a genuinely stable, democratic and\nmulti-racial South Africa requires increasing opportunities\nfor access to and participation in all areas of society,\nincluding the economy, by the country\u2019s African population.\nMy next subject is the progress towards peace in the\nMiddle East. Successive Governments of Papua New\nGuinea have consistently followed a policy of supporting\nthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders, while\nrecognizing the Palestinian people\u2019s right to a homeland.\nWe are accordingly both impressed and encouraged by the\ndramatic, bold and hopeful agreements reached by the Israeli\nGovernment and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nWe commend the steps that have since been taken,\nincluding the diplomatic and material support provided by\nother Governments to facilitate implementation of those\nagreements. As our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable\nPaias Wingti, has already announced, the Government of\nPapua New Guinea will do what little it can to further the\nprocess, by acknowledging the constructive role being played\nby the Palestine Liberation Organization and examining ways\nin which we might seek to strengthen relations with the\nlegitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.\nI come now to the reform and revitalization of the\nUnited Nations and the recharging of its resources.\nThe welcome developments in southern Africa and the\nMiddle East, particularly those related to Israel, the occupied\nterritories and the Palestine Liberation Organization, reveal\nboth strengths and weaknesses in the United Nations, and\nsuggest that while there are situations in which the United\nNations can play an important, even vital, role, there are also\nsituations in which it cannot.\nWe must recognize that when the United Nations itself\ncannot, for whatever reason, be effective, then individual\nGovernments, such as Norway\u2019s, regional organizations, such\nas the Organization of African Unity, or some other body\nmay be able to initiate or facilitate a positive outcome.\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the\nreforms which are gradually being made to the United\nNations system: in the Secretariat and other organs, and in\nthe manner in which our deliberations are organized. We\nalso welcome the generally revitalized role that our\nOrganization aspires to play in international relations. But\nwe must remember that internal reform and reorganization\nare only as important as their eventual outcome.\nA revitalized United Nations must not be allowed to\nbecome an instrument of sectional interests or ill-planned\nadventurism. In the context of the contrast between the\nevidently satisfactory outcome of United Nations efforts in\nCambodia and the uncertainties of the situation in Somalia,\nmy Government feels a need to sound a cautionary warning.\nThe terrible events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia,\nparticularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the mounting\ntoll of human death, injury and suffering resulting from\nconflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union reinforce my\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5\nGovernment\u2019s reservations about aspects of the current\ndebate over the part that the United Nations can and should\nplay in the post-cold-war international order.\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea is also\nconscious of the selectivity and costs of United Nations\npeace-keeping, peace-observing and peacemaking operations,\nand of the need to ensure that the Organization is reformed,\nrevitalized and re-endowed with sufficient resources to make\na difference to the very basis of peace in developing\ncountries: development itself.\nMy next topic is decolonization, indigenous people and\nnatural resources. In this, the United Nations International\nYear of the World\u2019s Indigenous People, my Government had\nthe rare privilege of hosting a Regional Seminar of the\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization, chaired by\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s Permanent Representative at the United\nNations. The occasion gave us an opportunity to reaffirm\nour commitment to the decolonization of New Caledonia,\nwith special safeguards for its indigenous people, the\nKanaks. The Government of Papua New Guinea is strongly\nopposed to any suggestion that the Matignon Accords might\nnot be fully honoured. The same position has been adopted\nby our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead Group and the\nSouth Pacific Forum.\nIn addition to the question of New Caledonia, the\nRegional Seminar also focused attention on other relics of\nEuropean colonialism, including French Polynesia, where\nPolynesian demands for independence seem to be gaining\nstrength.\nElsewhere in the South Pacific, the negotiated\nsettlement between the Governments of Nauru and Australia\nhas been widely welcomed for the redress it provides for a\nlong period of colonial exploitation of Nauru\u2019s principal\nland-based natural resource and the destruction of much of\nits natural environment.\nThe settlement is also arousing considerable interest as\nto its possible implications in other former Trust Territories\nand colonial dependencies. The Government of Papua New\nGuinea is only one of a number of interested parties which\nhave the matter under close examination. My Government\nis also only one among many in welcoming, and wishing to\nencourage, efforts to recognize the rights and to improve the\nsituation of other indigenous people in the South Pacific and\nelsewhere.\nTogether with our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead\nGroup - the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\n- we have signed a Declaration on Cooperation in\nDevelopment of Natural Resources. One of the explicit\nobjectives of the Declaration is to facilitate implementation\nof the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.\nAnother objective, which has yet to be realized, is to\nsupplement existing efforts in relation to regional fisheries\nby broadening and deepening cooperation between the\nGovernments of countries in the South Pacific where other\nnatural resources are being developed, often by outsiders.\nThe crisis in Papua New Guinea\u2019s North Solomons\nProvince is an unfortunate and costly internal affair of Papua\nNew Guinea. It continues, still unresolved, even as\nGovernment and other services are being restored. I am\ntherefore pleased to report that my Government has recently\nbeen engaged in productive exchanges with the Government\nof the Solomon Islands, particularly concerning the spill-over\neffects of the crisis on and near the common border.\nFollowing these exchanges, I have issued an invitation\non the Government\u2019s behalf to the Joint Assembly of the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States party to the\nLom\u00e9 Convention and the European Community to send a\nvisiting mission to Papua New Guinea, including the North\nSolomons Province, to assess the situation and to\nrecommend how it might assist in rehabilitation.\nThe Government has also announced its intention to\nwork towards an All-Bougainville Leaders\u2019 Conference to\ntry to resolve the crisis by political means. The Government\nof Solomon Islands has offered its cooperation in what has\nbeen, at times, a rather difficult situation. We hope to\ncontinue our dialogue over long-term measures to strengthen\nbilateral relations.\nWith respect to regional and global economic\ncooperation, the Government of Papua New Guinea, like\nmost other Members of the United Nations, is concerned at\nthe possibility that reform of the international trading system\nmight fail as a result of the apparent intransigence of vested\ninterests in certain developed countries during the final\nstages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We also do not\nbelieve that regional trading blocs can be an adequate\nsubstitute for an equitable and orderly international trading\nsystem.\nThe Government of Papua New Guinea does not see\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) as\na replacement or a rival for an updated version of GATT.\nBut we do regard APEC as being important to our interests.\nMore than 80 per cent in value of exports from Papua New\nGuinea go to the existing APEC member countries. Nearly\n90 per cent of our imports come from exactly the same\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncountries. Other aspects of Papua New Guinea\u2019s\ninternational economic relations are just as deeply enmeshed\nwith APEC members. With encouragement from existing\nmembers, my Government has therefore applied to join\nAPEC. We believe that it would not be right for such a\nbody to continue without a single member from the centre\nof a region whose name it bears: the Pacific. We look\nforward to an early - and positive - response to our\napplication.\nIn conclusion, I should like to say the following:\nNo human being can have failed to be deeply moved\nby, or to feel the utmost sympathy for, people affected by\nthe disastrous earthquake which occurred in India in late\nSeptember.\nNo one who has been following the developments\nconsequent on the changes in the former Soviet Union can\nhave failed to be both excited and concerned by the dramatic\npolitical and military confrontations which have been\noccurring in the Russian Federation. All of us must surely\nbe concerned at reports that nuclear testing has been\nresumed, at the possibility that more tests might follow, and\nthat weapons of mass destruction might grow in number,\npower and circulation.\nIn short, notwithstanding the progress made towards\nfinding lasting solutions to some long-standing issues since\nthe cold war ended, we continue to live in a rapidly\nchanging, often fragile and uncertain world. Able by virtue\nof our membership of the United Nations at least to let our\nviews be known on what are some of the most important\nand pressing issues of our time, the Government of Papua\nNew Guinea has, therefore, chosen to give close attention to\nan issue of particular concern to developing countries, to\nexplore avenues of cooperation with other States, and to\npropose a United Nations initiative on \\\"Opportunity and\nParticipation\\\". Let me end by repeating my previous call for\nmembers\u2019 support for a proposal intended to assist in\nidentifying what the people and Government of Papua New\nGuinea believe to be common interests, global problems and\npractical solutions.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and\nGovernment of the Republic of Fiji, I congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally very warmly on his election as\nPresident of the Assembly. I am confident that his extensive\nknowledge of the United Nations system and his wide\nexperience in the field of international relations will help\nguide this session to a successful conclusion.\nI wish to pay a tribute to Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the\nexcellent manner in which, as President, he conducted the\nbusiness of this Assembly at its last session. I express my\nadmiration and deep appreciation to him for a job well done.\nI also congratulate him for his initiative in rationalizing the\nwork of the Assembly, and especially in rationalizing its\nCommittee structure.\nMy delegation applauds the excellent work done by our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in the period\nsince he assumed his high office. I take this opportunity to\nexpress my Government\u2019s deep appreciation for his untiring\nefforts in tackling the difficult and complex problems facing\nthe world Organization.\nI should also like to extend a warm welcome to the\nnew States Members of the United Nations, the Principality\nof Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, the Principality of\nMonaco, the Slovak Republic and The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia. I am confident that the\nOrganization, as it continues to strive for universality, will\ngreatly benefit from their participation in its work.\nNew threats are endangering international peace and\nsecurity in all corners of the world. Incipient nationalism,\nethnic conflicts and excessive protectionism are threatening\npeace, security, and growth in trade. Thus, a heavy\nresponsibility is placed on this Organization, which, as we\nall know, is the main body responsible for promoting social\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\nBehind these complexities, there are also many\ndevastating structural problems that undermine even the best\nefforts to achieve security and economic progress.\nPopulation growth, if left unchecked, will add 97 million\npeople a year throughout the 1990s. Poverty, disease,\nfamine and oppression account for the 18 million refugees\nand 24 million displaced persons throughout the world. The\ngap between the rich and the poor countries has not\nnarrowed, but continues to grow as economic difficulties in\nthe industrialized countries have led to increased\nprotectionist measures against trade. Environmental\ndegradation further compounds these problems.\nIn the light of these trends, we must underscore the\nneed for better international cooperation in order to arrive at\neffective solutions. This, we believe, is a critical element in\nmoving us towards the creation of an international order in\nwhich this Organization assumes greater importance as the\ncentre of global endeavours.\nThe process of reviewing the role of the Organization\nthat is currently under way is therefore very timely. We\nhope that the review will assist greatly in determining how\nthe United Nations can be strengthened and, most important,\nhow each of us as Member countries might best contribute\nto the new order.\nThe Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the\nOrganization, has quite rightly stressed the need for adequate\nresources. We share his anxiety, and join in his call to\nMembers to ensure that their contributions to the regular\nbudget, as well as to the peace-keeping budget, are met on\ntime and in full. We must make every effort to explore all\npossible avenues for ensuring that the Organization is put\nback onto a viable financial path.\nMy Government would like to pay a tribute to the\nentire United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\n(UNTAC) team for the way in which they carried out their\nmission in particularly difficult and dangerous conditions.\nFiji is pleased to have joined other Members of the United\nNations in restoring peace in Cambodia through its\nparticipation in UNTAC.\nThat mission has now successfully completed its major\ntask. For the people of Cambodia, who unambiguously\ndemonstrated their desire for peace and democracy, it is the\nbeginning of a new era. We urge all factions to cooperate\nfully with the new Government by keeping alive the spirit of\nthe Agreements signed in Paris.\nThe age-old problem in the Middle East has taken a\nnew turn during the past month. This turn of events spells\nhope for the future in the Middle East - indeed, in the entire\nworld and for all humanity. The desire of both Prime\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Chairman Yasser\nArafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to\nachieve peace for their peoples has necessitated the\ndismantling of differences that have existed for decades.\nThe Washington accords should pave the way for a lasting\npeace.\nHumanity has been touched by this historic event - the\ncoming together of two arch-rivals for the sake of peace.\nWe congratulate Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat\n- indeed, all who have laboured to bring this peace pact to\nreality. We must also acknowledge the contribution of the\nUnited States of America and, indeed, the United Nations\nand others over the years.\nWhile positive developments are taking place in the\nMiddle East and Cambodia, Fiji is deeply saddened at the\nfact that the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains\nunresolved. Our profound sympathy goes to all who have\nsuffered untold misery. Such a tragedy should not be\nallowed to continue. We recognize that the issue is a highly\ncomplex one, but the international community must do all it\ncan to stop the slaughter, prevent the conflict from\nspreading, and achieve a lasting and equitable settlement.\nWe are equally saddened at the events in Somalia. The\nsuccess of the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) in meeting the humanitarian challenge has cast\na ray of hope, for which the United Nations deserves praise\nand, indeed, support. However, recent violence against\nUNOSOM II personnel must be condemned, and efforts to\nfind ways of reducing tension between the peace-keepers and\nthe local population must be given high priority.\nHaving for years witnessed the repugnant policy of\napartheid in South Africa, we are pleased at the rapidity with\nwhich that policy has recently been broken down. We\ncongratulate the leadership in South Africa - the South\nAfrican Government, the African National Congress (ANC)\nand others - for their courage, determination and foresight in\ngetting together and dismantling apartheid. The United\nNations has played a major role in the process, but we\nshould continue the effort until a democratic Government is\nelected by all - I repeat: all - the peoples of South Africa.\nFiji, like the other members of the South Pacific Forum,\nshares the sentiments that the Secretary-General expresses in\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", in which he highlights the positive\nrole that regional organizations can play in the maintenance\nof international peace and security in their own regions. Fiji\nwill support such regional initiatives.\nOn the economic front, we believe that a successful\nconclusion to the Uruguay Round is vital to economic\ngrowth and prosperity in all our countries. Only increased\naccess to markets for our exports, especially in areas of\ncomparative advantage, will enable us to increase our\nexternal purchasing power - our ability to pay for imports\nfrom the developed countries. In any event, we look\nforward to a genuinely equitable outcome that will include\na substantial and liberalizing effect on trade in agricultural\nproducts.\nSlow progress in finalizing the Round has led to the\nformation and strengthening of regional trading blocs. Many\nnew initiatives now being put in place are defensive\nresponses to existing regional trading arrangements. These\nhave the potential to weaken the multilateral character of the\ntrading system, as many of them do not comply with the\nspirit and the provisions of the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT).\nDeveloping countries, it has been estimated, lose about\n$100 billion a year in export revenues as a result of market\nbarriers in industrialized countries - about twice the official\ndevelopment assistance that the industrialized countries\nprovide. Furthermore, it is most ironic that taxpayers in the\nindustrialized countries pay both for aid and for imports that\nare more costly as a result of trade barriers, while the\npoorest developing countries lose more in trade than they\ngain in aid. For these reasons alone, further progress in\ntrade liberalization, through success in the Uruguay Round,\nis very urgent, and we join other delegations in stressing that\nno effort should be spared in bringing the Round to a\nsuccessful conclusion.\nOf the 42 resolutions on disarmament issues adopted by\nthe Assembly at its last session, 15 deal with various ways\nof controlling nuclear arms, the management of nuclear\nwaste, the banning of nuclear tests and the elimination of\nnuclear weapons. In this regard, we welcome the decisions\nby nuclear Powers to extend their testing moratorium, and\nwe regret very much that this moratorium has just been\nbreached. We call on all nuclear Powers to continue to\nhonour the moratorium. In August this year, the South\nPacific Forum welcomed the commitment by the\nGovernments of France, the United Kingdom and the United\nStates to the early negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty. We take this opportunity to urge all the nuclear-\nweapon States to participate actively in the negotiations and\nto adopt the Treaty as soon as possible.\nThe signing of the chemical-weapons Convention in\nParis early this year was a major step forward in the process\nof eliminating weapons of mass destruction. As a\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 11\ndemonstration of its commitment to that end, Fiji has not\nonly signed the Convention but also ratified it - the first\ncountry to do so.\nIn the South Pacific Forum, member Governments,\nincluding the Government of Fiji, highlighted the importance\nof an enhanced international regime to deal with possible\ntransboundary damage arising from peaceful nuclear activity,\nand noted the absence of effective international rules for\nnuclear liability. Members of the Forum have agreed to\nparticipate in the ongoing deliberations of the Standing\nCommittee on Nuclear Liability convened by the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and to support the\nestablishment of a comprehensive international legal regime\ndealing with liability for nuclear damage and reflecting fully\nthe principle that the polluter should pay.\nFiji welcomes the continuing growth in the number of\nparties to the non-proliferation Treaty and will support\nindefinite extension of the Treaty.\nIn support of international peace and security, we have\nconsistently contributed to many peace-keeping operations\nover the years. Since our first participation in peace-keeping\noperations in 1978, Fiji has been involved in seven. We pay\ntribute to the men and women currently engaged in United\nNations peace-keeping operations around the world.\nPeace-keepers are being increasingly asked to serve in\nhigh-risk environments. That these are high-risk operations\nis tragically borne out by the fact that hundreds of\npeace-keepers have made the supreme sacrifice in their\nservice to humanity.\nThe time is right for the issue of the safety and security\nof peace-keeping personnel to be addressed in a more\nsystematic, comprehensive and practical manner, and we\nsupport the notion wholeheartedly. The related question of\nresponsibility for attacks on United Nations and associated\npersonnel, and measures to ensure that those responsible for\nsuch attacks are brought to justice, is also now an important\none to address. We shall fully support any effort in that\ndirection.\nApart from the large increase in the number of\npeace-keeping operations, many important changes are taking\nplace in the nature of peace-keeping. The eight\npeace-keeping operations undertaken since the end of the\ncold war have involved not only traditional military activities\nbut also a wide range of humanitarian and civilian activities.\nThe constantly changing nature of the various crises means\nthat we must increasingly be more innovative in designing\npeace-keeping operations, as they are normally very costly.\nAs indicated in the report of the Secretary-General, the\n17 peace-keeping operations are now costing the\nOrganization some $2.8 billion annually. To some extent,\nthe answer to the increasing costs lies in more preventive\ndiplomacy aimed at defusing potential conflicts. Moreover,\nthe involvement of Member States, either on an individual\nbasis or through regional organizations, in peace-building\nand peace-keeping activities appears to be another effective\nway of preventing military clashes. In this regard, the\nSecretary-General has placed before us several suggestions\nwhich, we believe, deserve our serious consideration and\naction.\nI now wish to turn briefly to a subject that has been the\nfocus of a great deal of attention, especially during the last\nthree years; that is, the subject of sustainable development.\nSeveral resolutions adopted by the Assembly on following\nup the important decisions taken at Rio about 15 months ago\nare now being implemented at various levels. It is most\nencouraging that we now have 162 countries that have\nsigned the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and\n26 countries that have ratified it.\nFiji ratified the Convention in February this year, and\nhopes that the required number of ratifications, 50, will soon\nbe achieved, so that the Convention can enter into force. As\nglobal warming and a rise in sea level are amongst the most\nserious threats to the Pacific region and to the survival of\nsome small island States, Fiji reaffirms its support for the\nConvention and takes this opportunity to urge all States to\nsign and ratify it as soon as possible.\nFiji has been active in the area of environmental\nmanagement and protection. The Rio Conference has,\nhowever, changed the way in which many of us now view\nenvironment and development issues. More than ever\nbefore, we are committed to the idea that the development\nof our economy and society must not come at the expense\nof our environment. To the contrary: development and\nenvironmental protection are complementary.\nMy Government is committed to sound environmental\nmanagement and protection as an integral part of our\ndecision-making process. A national environment strategy\nhas now been adopted by the Government, and will form the\nbasis for further work on environmental issues in Fiji.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment has recognized in the Agenda 21 plan of action\nfor sustainable development, that small island developing\ncountries are a special case for sustainable development.\nSmall island countries supporting small communities are\necologically fragile and vulnerable; because of our small\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsize, our resources are limited, and because of our\ngeographic dispersion and isolation from markets, we are\nplaced at a disadvantage economically and have limited\neconomies of scale.\nOur dependence on the ocean and our coastal\nenvironments is also very significant. They are not only of\nstrategic importance to us; they also constitute a valuable\ndevelopment resource.\nIt was in this context that, last year, we welcomed the\nadoption of General Assembly resolution 47/189 calling for\na Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, to be convened in\nApril 1994. We appreciate the very important work that has\nbeen put into the organizational session and the preparatory\nmeetings, convened early this year. We hope that the\nConference will be successful and will help us not only to\nidentify the most critical issues involved but also to agree on\nprecise and practical solutions for overcoming our\nvulnerabilities. We urge all member countries to participate\nin this Conference and to assist in finding solutions to\nproblems that have buffeted small island countries for a very\nlong time.\nThe small island States contain a wealth of biological\ndiversity of global significance - our rich marine ecosystems\nrivalling the better-known tropical rain forests in their\nimportance to life on this planet and in their potential for\nnew knowledge and new products, including medicines. An\ninternational cooperative approach to conserving our coastal\nand marine resources would benefit not just the island States\nbut the world as a whole.\nThe international community met in July this year and\nexamined ways and means of conserving and managing\nstraddling and highly migratory fish stocks. We believe that\ngood progress was made at this meeting in identifying the\nproblems that exist and areas in which fisheries cooperation\nbetween States could be improved.\nThere are still, however, several important tasks\nremaining that need to be completed before the next session\nof the Assembly. Fiji, therefore, fully supports the\nconvening of two further sessions next year to enable the\nConference to reach agreement on all issues relating to the\nconservation and management of straddling and highly\nmigratory fish stocks.\nFiji was the first country to ratify the 1982 United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are\ntherefore gratified that the Convention is soon to achieve the\n60 ratifications required for its entry into force. We\ncontinue to support all efforts towards universal participation\nin this very important Convention, which is to govern over\n70 per cent of the Earth\u2019s surface. In this regard, we are\npleased that all States - including now the United States -\nare engaged in the ongoing dialogue to resolve the\noutstanding problems and thereby pave the way towards\nuniversality for the Convention.\nOver the next few years, the Organization will be\nfocusing its attention and energies on the convening of\nseveral very important international conferences. While\nthese conferences will be important in themselves, as they\nwill bring together the world community, they will not only\ndiscuss issues that are assigned to them but will also provide\nopportunities to arrive by consensus at solutions to many of\nthe critical problems facing the world today.\nThe World Summit on Social Development planned for\n1995 will help to strengthen social development in all\ncountries by giving political impetus, at the highest level, to\nthe promotion of social policies. The three core issues that\nhave been established for the Summit - the alleviation of\npoverty, the growth of employment, and the enhancement of\nsocial integration, especially of disadvantaged groups - are\nall essential. Above all, the Summit should, in our view,\nfoster greater understanding of the importance of social\ndevelopment and, particularly, its relationship with economic\ndevelopment and protection of the environment.\nThe Fourth World Conference on Women, to be\nconvened in Beijing in 1995, will, we hope, be action--\noriented and provide an opportunity to review past activities\nand, most important, set new priorities. For its part, my\nGovernment is fully committed to strengthening the role of\nwomen in economic and social development and has taken\nseveral steps to integrate women into the mainstream of\nnational development. Towards this end, plans have been\nformulated and are being implemented by the Ministry of\nWomen and Culture, other sectoral ministries and non-\ngovernmental organizations. Women constitute more than\n50 per cent of Fiji\u2019s population, which makes them valuable\npartners in the growth and development of our country and\nthe uplifting of our people.\nWe are, at the same time, also turning our attention to\nthe situation and needs of children in Fiji as we continue to\nparticipate actively in Universal Children\u2019s Day. Fiji has\nratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and has\nsigned the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and\nDevelopment of Children in the 1990s. We have also\nundertaken a detailed study of the situation of children in\nFiji and have identified areas which require our attention.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 13\nWe are now in the process of following up the\nrecommendations of this study.\nFiji, as a multiracial and multicultural community,\nattaches great significance to family values and family\ntraditions. We therefore welcome and appreciate the\ndecision by the United Nations to observe 1994 as the\nInternational Year of the Family. My Government has\nalready formed a national committee, comprising\nrepresentatives from both government and non-governmental\nsectors, to make preparations for observance of the\nInternational Year of the Family in a meaningful and\npractical way.\nThe International Year of the World\u2019s Indigenous\nPeople will soon be coming to a close. With the observance\nof the International Year the attention of the United Nations\nhas for the first time been focused directly and solely on\nindigenous peoples. Next year, the Commission on Human\nRights will assess the activities of the Year. It is important\nthat the voices of indigenous peoples should continue to be\nheard, and their right to self-determination, their right to\nrebuild their communities in dignity with freedom of choice,\nmust continue to receive the full support of the United\nNations.\nThe draft text of a declaration on indigenous peoples\u2019\nrights, first proposed in 1985, received the approval of the\nWorking Group last July. Fiji welcomes the Working\nGroup\u2019s decision as an important step towards a\nmuch-needed international instrument on indigenous peoples\u2019\nrights.\nThe International Year of the World\u2019s Indigenous\nPeople, should not, we believe, be treated as an isolated\nevent, but as the beginning of a long-term policy of\nsupporting, protecting and learning from the world\u2019s\nindigenous peoples. For our part, we have set aside a\nspecial day in our nation\u2019s calendar to commemorate this\nevent, coinciding with the birthday of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna,\none of the great leaders of the indigenous people of Fiji.\nThe indigenous people now comprise the majority of\nFiji\u2019s population but my Government recognizes the need\nand will do its utmost to ensure unity, order, equity and\nsecurity for all the people of Fiji, so that we can all live in\npeace and harmony. We will continue to ensure that\nharmonious relationships are established and maintained both\namong our own people at home and with other people\nabroad.\nWith reference to my own region, the South Pacific, we\nare following very closely the current progress in New\nCaledonia towards the self-determination of that territory.\nWe hope that the developments, as envisaged under the\nMatignon and Oudinot accords, will continue so that the\nindigenous Kanak population will be fully prepared to take\npart in the referendum in 1998 and to decide on the future\npolitical status of their country.\nSpeaking at the session of the General Assembly last\nyear, on 8 October, Fiji\u2019s Prime Minister, Major General\nSitiveni Rabuka, promised to initiate a review of the 1990\nConstitution of Fiji, which has been the subject of\ncontroversy both locally and abroad. I am pleased to say\nthat my Government has already set in train the process for\nthe review of the Constitution, as promised. The review is\nto consider how the provisions of the Constitution can be\nimproved upon to reflect fully the concerns and interests of\nFiji\u2019s multi-ethnic and multicultural society.\nThis Organization, now almost 50 years old, has stood\nthe test of time but, like other institutions, it must also adjust\nto change. We must continue to examine ways of making\nit a forum for both discussion and action on the important\nsocial, economic and political issues facing the world\ncommunity as they evolve.\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my country\u2019s\ncommitment to the United Nations and to the spirit of\ninternational cooperation and solidarity that it embodies. My\ncountry, and its people, joins with other nations to do its\nutmost to seek world peace, stability and sustainable\ndevelopment for all. We firmly believe that the United\nNations remains the only hope for mankind to achieve peace\nand prosperity. It is through the combined efforts of all\nMember States, large and small, that we can develop a\nglobal environment which is just and equitable and which\nreflects the legitimate needs and interests of all peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nam delighted to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the\nTanzanian delegation, our sincere congratulations on your\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Over the past two\nweeks you have already demonstrated your considerable\ndiplomatic skills and leadership qualities. We look forward\nto a productive session under your guidance.\nI would also like to extend my delegation\u2019s appreciation\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for\nthe leadership he provided to the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nThe Secretary-General and the staff he leads have\ncontinued to give of their best to our Organization. Over the\npast year they have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to\ntake on additional responsibilities despite dwindling\nresources. We owe them a debt of gratitude and they have\na right to expect our support as they carry out the work we\nhave entrusted to them.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nDuring the past year, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\nMonaco, Eritrea, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and Andorra have joined the United Nations as\nsovereign and independent States. It gives me great pleasure\nto extend to them a warm welcome and sincere\ncongratulations and to say how much we look forward to\nworking closely with all of them in the common endeavour\nto make our world a better place for our peoples and for all\nmankind.\nAnother year has passed since we last met in the\ngeneral debate and pledged to intensify our efforts to satisfy\nthe aspirations of our peoples for world peace and security,\nfor economic and social justice and for progress and\ndevelopment, in conditions of freedom and human dignity.\nIt is proper that as we start another session, we should take\nstock of the progress made towards the realization of these\naspirations.\nThe problems of southern Africa remained a major\npreoccupation of my Government during the past year. My\ndelegation commends the international community for its\ncontribution in the search for solutions to the problems of\napartheid in South Africa and the conflicts in Angola and\nMozambique.\nOver the last 12 months, the advance towards the\neradication of apartheid has brought the goal nearer than\never before. The call by the representatives of the majority\npeople of South Africa, notably by President Nelson\nMandela of the African National Congress of Azania (ANC),\nfor the lifting of virtually all remaining economic and trade\nsanctions means that the progress made thus far, and the\nprogress soon to be made, represent profound and\nirreversible change in terms of the Declaration on Apartheid\nand its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa.\nWhatever happens, South Africa will never be the same.\nA very important recent signal suggesting that the\nturning-point is very close was the fixing of 27 April 1994\nas election day for all South Africans. My delegation\nwarmly welcomes this development and urges all concerned\nto work to achieve that target. The most important\ndevelopment, however, has been the enactment last month of\nthe legislation necessary for the establishment of an\nindependent electoral commission, an independent media\ncouncil and an independent broadcasting authority as well as\na Transitional Executive Council.\nRegrettably, there remain many obstacles on the road.\nViolence remains the most serious obstacle impeding\nprogress towards the establishment of a united, democratic\nand non-racial South Africa. With 20,000 murders per year,\naccording to records compiled by the Southern African\nResearch and Documentation Centre, South Africa\u2019s\nreputation of being the most violent country in the world is\nwell deserved. The leadership of the democratic forces in\nthe country must be commended for denying the forces of\ndeath and destruction the satisfaction of derailing the peace\nprocess. But the threat remains real and great, as evidenced\nby the brutal assassination of Chris Hani in April and the\nstorming by a right-wing racist white group of the\nnegotiations at the World Trade Centre in June.\nInternational monitoring of the violence has provided\nsome reassurance to the victims of apartheid violence. The\ntemerity and audacity shown by the perpetrators of violence\nand the blind eye turned to it by some members, including\nleaders, of the country\u2019s security forces, argue for a much\nlarger, higher-profile United Nations presence in South\nAfrica. I urge the United Nations to respond positively to\nthe urgent pleas of the victims of violence for more United\nNations monitors.\nAnother obstacle is the non-participation by some\ngroups in the peace process and the threat of violence issued\nby some of them. This is yet another argument for\nincreasing the presence and raising the profile of the United\nNations, and of the world community as a whole, in South\nAfrica.\nAngola poses a similar but more urgent challenge to the\nUnited Nations. If it has a conscience, the international\ncommunity simply cannot allow the continuation of a\nconflict that is estimated to be claiming a thousand lives a\nday. It must act to stop this carnage.\nAt the same time, we must make every effort to enable\nthe United Nations to recover from the considerable damage\ndone to its credibility and moral authority by its inability to\nrespond adequately and promptly to the grave challenges\nposed by Jonas Savimbi. The adoption of Security Council\nresolution 864 (1993) on 15 September 1993 has served to\nput Jonas Savimbi on notice that the United Nations will no\nlonger allow his obstinacy and prevarication to continue to\nthwart the will of the Angolan people, whose hopes for\npeace and an opportunity to improve their lives have been so\nrudely shaken by his greed for power. UNITA and Savimbi\nmust be left in no doubt that there is more to come if they\ncontinue to ignore the pleas of the international community\nfor a cease-fire, for a return to the Bicesse Accords and for\nrespect for the electoral verdict of the Angolan people.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7\nThis applies equally to UNITA\u2019s obligation to allow\nand to facilitate access by humanitarian and relief\norganizations to the victims of the conflict. Many relief\npersonnel have exposed themselves to serious danger in\norder to help victims of the conflict. We commend them for\ntheir heroism and compassion. The best form of gratitude,\nhowever, is to ensure that those responsible for this criminal\nconduct receive appropriate punishment.\nAlthough different, Mozambique offers some parallels\nwith Angola, and it remains to be seen during the\nimplementation of the Mozambican peace accords whether\nthe correct lessons have been learned from the Angolan\nexperience. The delay in the implementation of the General\nPeace Agreement is a matter of great concern because of the\nobvious threat it poses to the cease-fire. We are pleased to\nnote that the Security Council has taken the same serious\nview of the delay. We are pleased also to note that at long\nlast the leader of RENAMO, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, has\nbeen able to overcome the difficulties which until recently\nprevented him from meeting with President Chissano. We\nwelcome the talks between the two leaders and commend\nPresident Chissano for bending over backwards to\naccommodate RENAMO. But we are concerned that the\ngood will and magnanimity of the Government of\nMozambique are not being reciprocated by RENAMO and\nits leadership. Instead, we observe disturbing signs of its\nfollowing in the footsteps of Savimbi.\nFor example, the Government is still not able to provide\nadministrative services in the areas under the control of\nRENAMO. The United Nations has a duty to prevent such\na blatant violation of the General Peace Agreement. But,\nmore ominously, RENAMO seems to be contriving to create\na situation in which it hopes to persuade the world to accept\nthe holding of elections before the process of demobilization\nand the integration of forces has begun. We must spare no\nefforts to enable the United Nations to do all in its power to\nprevent an Angola-type situation from emerging in\nMozambique.\nRegrettably, as the year continued there were more\ndisappointments than successes. With the exception of\nAngola, perhaps the most disconcerting were the setbacks\nsuffered by the peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia - in\nparticular in Bosnia and Herzegovina - in Afghanistan and\nin Somalia, where the turn of events has led to a wholly\nunexpected and unwelcome confrontation between the United\nNations and one of the factions in the tragic fratricidal\nconflict plaguing that country.\nWe must do all we can to protect and preserve the\nintegrity and moral authority of the United Nations in\nSomalia. Those responsible for the killing of United Nations\npeace-keeping forces and for instigating attacks against them\nmust be left in no doubt about the dire consequences of their\ncriminal conduct. But it goes without saying that the United\nNations forces must themselves act with maximum restraint.\nBecause Somalia is such a new experience for the\nUnited Nations, the outcome of its operation there is of\ncrucial importance to the international community. The\nUnited Nations cannot afford to fail in its mission of\nhumanitarian assistance, peace-building and peace-keeping\nin Somalia. Nor can it afford serious mistakes. My\ndelegation therefore welcomes the ongoing debate on how\nbest to achieve the United Nations mission in Somalia. The\ncall for the United Nations to refocus its attention on the\noriginal mandate and to pay greater attention to the search\nfor a political solution, along the lines of the Addis Ababa\nAgreement, deserves most urgent attention.\nThe cease-fire in Liberia, while holding, will remain\nfragile while tensions remain high and the end of the crisis\nis not in sight. The countries of the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) must be commended for\nundertaking an extremely costly and dangerous peace-\nkeeping mission in Liberia on behalf of the international\ncommunity. They need more than the moral and political\nsupport of the world community. We therefore welcome the\nestablishment, by Security Council resolution 866 (1993) of\n22 September 1993, of the United Nations Observer Mission\nin Liberia (UNOMIL), which will work alongside the\nprecedent-setting African peace-keeping effort under the\nauspices of ECOWAS to help resolve the Liberian conflict.\nThe people of Western Sahara are understandably\nfrustrated that, five years after the adoption of the United\nNations plan for a referendum in Western Sahara, the\ninternational community has still not been able to give\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthem an opportunity to exercise their right to\nself-determination. It is not good enough to tell them that\nevery effort is being made to overcome the problems which\nhave prevented the holding of the referendum. After five\nyears of discussion of the modalities of implementation, they\nhave a right to ask whether all the parties have been\nnegotiating in good faith.\nAnother African conflict-resolution initiative which\ndeserves urgent United Nations support is the Peace\nAgreement between the Government of Rwanda and the\nRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF), which was signed in\nArusha, Tanzania, on 4 August 1993 after a year of arduous\nand protracted negotiations. As Facilitator in the\nnegotiations, Tanzania pays tribute to the parties to the\nnegotiations for their spirit of give and take, which enabled\nthe negotiations to succeed. We pay tribute to the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) for its invaluable role\nthroughout the peace process. We also pay tribute to the\nobserver countries - Belgium, Burundi, France, Germany,\nSenegal, Uganda, the United States and Zaire - and to the\nUnited Nations for their encouragement and support. Nor\nshould we forget the invaluable contribution of Mali,\nNigeria, Tunisia and Zimbabwe, which provided personnel\nfor the Neutral Military Observer Group (NMOG II), which\nhas been monitoring the cease-fire.\nAs implementation of the Agreement begins, priority\nmust now be given to the establishment of the neutral\ninternational force. The joint delegation of the Government\nof Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front currently\nvisiting the United Nations has been stressing that everything\nelse hinges on the establishment of that force. I echo their\nappeal for speed in establishing the force. My delegation\ntherefore welcomes the timely adoption of Security Council\nresolution 872 (1993) on 5 October 1993, authorizing the\nestablishment of the United Nations Assistance Mission for\nRwanda (UNAMIR), and urges its speedy implementation.\nComparisons are inadequate for measuring the suffering\nor damage endured by people in a war, but it is difficult to\nthink of another current conflict in which a whole people has\nbeen subjected to the suffering, inhumanity and indignities\nthat have been imposed on the Muslim population of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. The inability of the United Nations to\noffer any hope to the Bosnian Muslims is one of the greatest\ntragedies of our time. It is bad enough that the international\ncommunity has failed to put an end to the atrocities which\ncontinue to be inflicted on the Bosnian Muslims. But for the\nworld\ncommunity in these circumstances to continue to deny them\nthe right to acquire the means with which to protect\nthemselves is incomprehensible. The least that the United\nNations can do is to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in order to enable the people to defend their\nfamilies and their country.\nAt long last there are signs of an emerging solution to\nthe long-festering sore of the root cause of the Middle East\nproblem - the question of Palestine - the persistence of\nwhich has for 40 years posed a serious moral dilemma for\nthe international community\u2019s sense of justice, fairness and\nequality. The agreement signed in Washington on\n13 September 1993 between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) on mutual recognition, which\nalso provides for limited autonomy for Palestinians in the\nGaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, has been\nrightly hailed as a major breakthrough in the Middle East\nnegotiations. My delegation joins in welcoming this\ndevelopment and in congratulating Israel and the PLO on the\ncourage they have shown in taking this bold step towards the\nresolution of the intractable question of Palestine. The first\nstep is always the most difficult to take. We are, therefore,\nhopeful that Israel and the PLO will now be able to move\nquickly to advance the process towards a just and lasting\nsolution to the question of Palestine and thus open the way\ntowards a comprehensive settlement of the Arab/Israel\nconflict.\nFor the people of Cyprus - another vexed question that\nhas defied solution for nearly 20 years - a meaningful new\nworld order must be one that respects the unity, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity as well as the non-aligned status of\nthat country, and restores a sense of hope to the two\ncommunities for a future of partnership and cooperation in\ncomplete equality and human dignity. It is a matter of great\ndisappointment that the hopes raised by the resumption early\nin the year of negotiations under the good offices of the\nSecretary-General proved to be premature.\nIn Cambodia, the efforts of the United Nations to find\na just and enduring end to the long-running conflict have\nbegun to bear fruit. The successful organization and\nsupervision of the Cambodian elections concluded an\nimportant and crucial phase of the peace effort. However,\nthe people of Cambodia are not yet out of the woods. There\nis still a lot of healing of wounds to be done. We applaud\nthe efforts being exerted to enable those who walked out of\nthe peace process to rejoin it as the phase of reconciliation,\nreconstruction and development begins.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9\nThere is good news too with regard to the situation in\nCentral America. There, the situation has continued to\nevolve positively, thus rewarding the international\ncommunity in its efforts to encourage the region to find\nregional solutions to its problems.\nMy delegation welcomes the growing involvement of\nthe Security Council in the search for solutions to many\nconflicts around the world. But the Council\u2019s capacity to\nrespond to the growing demands for its intervention and the\nreadiness of the international community to continue to\nrepose its trust and confidence in the Council will depend on\nits ability to institute the necessary reforms.\nOne such reform that has been called for is the\nexpansion of the Council to take account of today\u2019s vastly\nchanged circumstances in comparison with 1965, when the\nCouncil was last expanded. I need not stress that any\nexpansion must take account of the need to ensure equity in\ngeographical representation. This also applies to the call for\nconsideration to be given to increasing the number of\npermanent members.\nAnother reform relates to the need to address the\nproblem of selectivity by the Council in responding to\nvarious conflicts. Unless the Council is seen to treat equally\nall challenges to its authority, it runs the risk of losing the\ninternational community\u2019s support and trust, which are\ncrucial if the Council\u2019s actions are to be accepted as\nlegitimate.\nIn addition, the old problem of the outdated veto is still\nwith us and failure to do something about it will not make\nit go away. The very encouraging practice of reaching\ndecisions by consensus has reduced the demand for the\nabolition of the veto. This has helped, but it is not enough.\nSo long as the veto exists, the threat of its use will continue\nto affect the outcome of debates. One member will always\nbe able to thwart the will of the international community.\nHow the Council does its work is also a matter of great\ninterest and concern to the international community. The\ncall for transparency is a very legitimate one, but of greater\nconcern is the growing conviction on the part of a large\nsegment of the membership of the United Nations that the\nCouncil has been stretching its interpretation of the Charter\nto include things not foreseen in Chapter VII, such as\nhumanitarian emergencies, human rights, ecological threats,\ndrug trafficking and the like. While the Council must be\nenabled to respond to new situations, there is a real danger\nthat it will allow itself to be guided not by the Charter but\nby the dictates of a few Member States.\nDisarmament has always been a major preoccupation of\nthe international community for reasons that are self-evident.\nThere are far too many weapons around the world - more\nthan nations need for their legitimate defence. The priority\ngiven to the chemical weapons Convention reflects the\ninternational community\u2019s concern about the great danger\nposed to international peace and security by this particular\nweapon of mass destruction. Regrettably, nuclear arms,\nwhich pose an even greater threat, have not received the\npriority consideration they deserve. While we applaud the\nagreements concluded by the United States and the Russian\nFederation for sharp reductions in their nuclear arsenals, the\nfact should not be overlooked that, even after the START\nTreaty, there are today in their stockpiles five times more of\nthis category of nuclear weapons than existed at the time of\nthe signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons in 1968, and the level is the same as it was when\nthey began negotiations nine years before the START Treaty\nwas signed. The reality of the nuclear threat becomes more\nevident if we take account of the nuclear-weapon stocks of\nthe other nuclear-weapon States. That is why we must urge\nall nuclear-weapon States to accord the highest priority to\nnuclear disarmament.\nMy delegation has always regarded the non-proliferation\nTreaty, despite its flaws, and a comprehensive test-ban treaty\nas important international instruments that can advance the\ncause of nuclear disarmament. It goes without saying that\nbefore the non-proliferation Treaty can perform this role, its\ninherent flaws - especially its provisions discriminating\nbetween nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States -\nmust be addressed. The two major nuclear-weapon States\nhave agreed on some reductions in their stockpiles. They\nneed to go much further and to make clear that the objective\nis the eventual elimination of those stockpiles, which means\nthat they must stop, reverse and eventually put an end to\nvertical proliferation. The 1995 Review Conference of the\nTreaty will be a success to the extent that it comes to grips\nwith these flaws.\nThe most hopeful recent development towards a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty has been the voluntary\nmoratorium or restraint on testing unilaterally agreed to by\nall the nuclear-weapon States. That is why we welcome the\ndecision of the United States of America to extend its\nmoratorium. We very much hope that this extension will\npersuade the other nuclear-weapon States to maintain their\nmoratoriums and that the halt can be used to negotiate a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty under the auspices of the\nConference on Disarmament or the Amendment Conference\nof the partial test-ban Treaty.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe world economic statistics for the period 1992 to\n1993 send mixed signals. Overall, despite strong growth in\na number of developing countries, there was negligible\ngrowth in the world economy. For much of the African\ncontinent, per capita output has continued to decline, placing\nthe continent in a precarious situation. The average growth\nof gross domestic product in Africa reached a new low of\n1.4 per cent in 1992, owing in part to drought, civil wars,\npolitical instability and the long-term effects of deteriorating\nterms of trade as a result of the inequitable operation of the\npresent world order.\nThe United Nations agenda for the development of\nAfrica in the 1990s, adopted by the General Assembly at its\nlast session, seems unlikely to fare any better than its\npredecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development, 1986-1990.\nAs became obvious during the review of the Programme of\nAction carried out in 1990, that initiative fell short of the\ncontinent\u2019s expectations. Nevertheless, Tanzania believes\nthat both the United Nations and the international community\nat large still have the ability to play a greater role in\nassisting the continent to overcome its poverty.\nRecovery of investments is crucial to the long-term\nimprovement of the economic performance of the African\ncontinent. However, contrary to earlier expectations,\neconomic reform has not brought a significant increase in\ninvestments. Throughout Africa, it remains far below its\npeak level of the mid-1970s as a result of foreign exchange\nconstraints arising from deteriorating terms of trade and\nlimited capacity to import capital goods, and because of the\ndebt burden and debt servicing.\nTanzania welcomes the initiative taken by some donor\ncountries to address the problem of the debt crisis by writing\noff part of the bilateral official debt of the least developed\ncountries. However, this is only part of the solution to the\nproblem. Apart from debt-relief measures, Africa needs a\nfresh infusion of financial resources to improve the rate of\ninvestment and to accelerate the economic growth of\naffected countries.\nIt is for this reason that Tanzania welcomes the\ninitiative of the Government of Japan to organize, in\ncollaboration with the United Nations and the Global\nCoalition for Africa, the Tokyo International Conference on\nAfrican Development in October 1993, with a view to\nhighlighting the issue of African economic development as\none of the central themes on the international agenda for the\ntwenty-first century. My delegation hopes that the Tokyo\nConference will come up with concrete recommendations on\nmeasures designed to help the African continent overcome\nits problems once and for all, as well as to remind the\ninternational community of its commitment to Africa and the\nneed to help the continent face the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century from a position of strength.\nWe have been walking the road from Rio for more than\na year now. In Rio we made a strong commitment to\nprotect our planet by promoting sustainable development\nthrough a global partnership. Though a basic framework to\nmake the world\u2019s environment healthier in the twenty-first\ncentury was laid out at Rio, we have not, so far, begun\nmaking those commitments a reality. The truth is, the Earth\nis environmentally poorer than it was a year ago.\nThe high-level Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment has been formed to monitor progress in the\nimplementation of Agenda 21 and other activities related to\nthe integration of environmental and developmental goals\nthrough the United Nations system. Allow me to express\nmy delegation\u2019s hope that this Commission will be an\naction-oriented body which will effectively translate the\ncommitments made in Rio into a reality, and that it will not\nend up being financially strapped, as has often been the fate\nof other United Nations institutions.\nA milestone reached at Rio was the decision to prepare\nan international convention to combat desertification and\ndrought. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for\nthe elaboration of this convention has already held its first\nand second substantive sessions and it is hoped that,\nhopefully by this time next year, a convention to combat\ndesertification and drought will have been finalized. While\nwelcoming the progress made during the first two\nsubstantive sessions, Tanzania wishes to call for maximum\nsupport and cooperation from all countries to ensure the\nsuccess of the global convention, which has particular\nrelevance for Africa. The convention should be looked\nupon, not only as a mechanism to attract resources, but also\nas a global partnership in combating a global phenomenon\nthreatening the sustainable development of over 900 million\npeople worldwide.\nThere is no end to our expectations in fulfilment of the\nUnited Nations. As the largest world family, it has to take\ncare of all the members of the family, rich and poor, able\nand disabled. The world would be a better place for mankind\nif we in the United Nations act expeditiously, judiciously\nand fairly. After all, it is the people who constitute the\nStates that need help.\n"

        "file_text": "Your unanimous election, Sir, to the presidency of the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly represents a just\nrecognition of your great diplomatic experience, your human\nqualities and your constant commitment to the promotion of\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 11\ndialogue and multilateral cooperation in the service of peace,\nsecurity and development.\nI should like to congratulate you most warmly on the\nwell-deserved tribute from the international community both\nto you personally and to your country. I am particularly\npleased that the prestigious responsibility of guiding the\nwork of the General Assembly has been given this year to\nan eminent son of Guyana, a country which, side-by-side\nwith Algeria, has always been resolutely in the forefront of\nthe defence of the cause of peace, justice, progress and\nunderstanding among nations.\nYour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, firmly and\ntactfully conducted a busy and productive forty-seventh\nsession. We wish to express our deep gratitude to him for\na mission accomplished with open-mindedness and\ndedication.\nI also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nwho has spared no effort in making the United Nations rise\nto the many and complex challenges of a crucial period in\nthe development of international relations. His foresight,\ncourage and initiative have won him the esteem of all. His\npersevering activity bears for the United Nations the promise\nof the renewal after which our peoples fervently aspire.\nAlgeria extends a warm welcome to the new Member\nStates which have joined our Organization, and is gratified\nthat their accession to the membership of the United Nations\nwill contribute to the achievement of its objectives in the\nareas of peace and development.\nIn recent years, the history of the world has accelerated\nits pace considerably. Rapid and profound changes have put\npaid to an international order that had long been frozen in\nplace by the cold war. However, far from moving steadily\ntoward the achievement of a well-ordered international\nsociety, those changes have generated the makings of a\ndisquieting explosion. While the world changes under our\nvery eyes, we are unable to grasp and take cognizance of the\nlaws that govern such change. This dynamic, and the major\nupheavals it causes, have shaped a new geopolitical\nconfiguration in many parts of the world that has affected\nthe lives of many of its peoples. Given this type of change,\nwherein inter-State relations are jostled by a proliferation of\nprotagonists, of ambitions and gambles, and of the methods\nof international action there is a need for a collective effort\nto revitalize both our means of knowing and our methods of\naction. In short, we need to rethink the world order. We\nmust, as a community of nations, succeed in controlling the\nchanges which are taking place and the unwieldy trends that\nare now emerging. In this maelstrom of historical change,\nthis period of transition with all its hesitations and emerging\nglobal dangers, the thing that attracts one\u2019s attention more\nthan any other is the hope, the promise of a new world order\nthat must be fashioned side by side with the daily suffering\nthat goes on in the world and which we cannot ignore.\nIndeed, in spite of the glowing promises of peace and\ninternational cooperation, the world order that is taking\nshape now not only contains too many old hotbeds of\ntension, but also gives rise to new mushrooming conflicts.\nTensions between ethnic and religious groups are increasing\nand are being exacerbated while whole regions, and even\nentire continents, are being marginalized in a most atrocious\nmanner. The right of peoples to self-determination is being\nviolated and obstructed here and there. Hunger and poverty\nare expanding. Imbalances in the world economy are\ndeepening and worsening. All of these situations pose\nchallenges to the international community that call for urgent\nand concerted action.\nIt is therefore up to us - and this is the challenge faced\nby all nations that are bound by an ever-growing\ninterdependence - to see to it that the ideals of justice and\npeace prevail, that new possibilities for the settlement of\ncertain regional conflicts and for general and complete\ndisarmament lead to comprehensive action eliminating the\nroot causes of conflicts while, at the same time, promoting\neconomic and social development, a prerequisite for\ninternational peace and security.\nThis is why it is appropriate to underscore here the fact\nthat the Agenda for Peace (A/47/277), whose importance is\nrecognized everywhere, will achieve its objectives only if it\nis accompanied by an agenda for development; for peace and\ndevelopment are closely interrelated, and conflicts too often\ntake root in the soil of injustice and poverty. It is obvious\nthat the future of the system of collective security which we\nwish to build will depend to a great extent on our ability to\nforge a consensus on the different aspects contained in the\nAgenda for Peace. This means that it is necessary for us to\ncontinue, collectively and without bias, to consider those\naspects of the Secretary-General\u2019s report about which\ndifferences persist or which require further elaboration and\nconsideration.\nThe encouraging progress achieved in strengthening the\ncapability of the United Nations in the areas of active\npreventive diplomacy, as well as in peace-keeping and\npeacemaking operations, should be welcomed, but a great\ndeal remains to be done in this field if we are to make better\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nuse of all the experience gained in those areas by the United\nNations. We should see to it that our action remains strictly\nfaithful to the goals and principles of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. Algeria, which is honoured to participate\nactively and concretely in peace-keeping operations, will\ncontinue to do its share in this collective endeavour in the\nservice of peace.\nThe restructuring, revitalization and rationalization of\nthe structures of the organs of the United Nations and their\nworking methods have made considerable progress.\nHowever, this process, which is not an end in itself, will\nproduce its full effects only if the Member States, and\nparticularly the developed countries, reaffirm and strengthen\ntheir commitment to the United Nations and renew their\npolitical and financial support for its activities, particularly\nin the economic and social spheres.\nIt is this exacting and responsible approach that my\ncountry consistently promotes in all the areas of cooperation\nin which it takes part. In so doing, Algeria conducts its own\naction within the context of the efforts by the Non-Aligned\nMovement toward greater democratization of the United\nNations and better balance between the spheres of\ncompetence of its organs. In our view, it is time we\nreflected collectively on how to reform the Security Council,\nwith a view to broadening its composition, improving its\nworking methods and making it more accountable for its\naction to the entire international community in whose name\nit adopts its resolutions. A more representative, more\ntransparent Security Council that would be more cognizant\nof the views and concerns of all; a General Assembly that\nwould fully play its role in activating, guiding and\nsupervising; and a United Nations system that would be\nmore coherent and better coordinated in carrying out its\ndevelopment tasks: these are the three pivotal approaches\nthat may give to the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization\nsignificant political scope and operational content and\ngenerate the makings of a new beginning. The credibility of\nthe United Nations and the effectiveness of its action depend\non this, as do international peace, security and cooperation.\nAll the initiatives by my country at the national and\nregional levels are inspired by the ideals of peace, justice\nand cooperation. The national-renewal plan upon which\nAlgeria has embarked in the interests of political stability,\nthe consolidation of the democratic process, the revitalization\nof economic growth and the upholding of the rule of law is\na plan that translates into action our resolve to guarantee, for\nall Algerians, the rights to security and well-being in a just,\nmodern and democratic society.\nGiven this determination, our efforts in combating\nterrorism and our efforts aimed at providing the conditions\nfor real growth stem from the same overriding priority, that\nof meeting the expectations of our people be fulfilled by\nrestoring the authority of the State and creating the\nconditions for an orderly transition that would make possible\nstable and coherent progress towards a market economy\nthrough viable and orderly reforms.\nSuch a vast enterprise must find its expression and\nderive its support from an active foreign policy based on the\nprinciples and ideals of non-alignment and geared towards\nthe promotion of peace, stability and cooperation at the\nregional and international levels.\nIn this spirit, Algeria works steadily and resolutely for\nsuccess in the process of building a united Maghreb. The\nimportant achievements that have been made so far, which\nwill help us to benefit from the complementary nature of the\ncountries of the union of the Arab Maghreb, confirm that the\ndynamics of this unifying process have enabled us to\nmobilize our energies, despite certain persistent problems\nthat affect regional stability.\nOur country\u2019s central position in the region, its resolve\nto reinforce and promote the building of the Maghreb and its\ncommitment to international legality have prompted it to\nencourage the kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front\nto turn to direct, sincere, constructive dialogue that can\nfacilitate the implementation of the peace plan prepared\njointly by the United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, with the full agreement of the two parties\nconcerned.\nIt is important, now more than ever before, that the\ndialogue which was initiated at El-Ayoun between Morocco\nand the Polisario Front should resume and continue at an\nauthoritative level. Algeria, for its part, hopes that the two\nparties will choose the path of reason and that will do all in\ntheir power to resolve outstanding questions in a serious\nmanner and without delay, thus promoting the holding of a\nfree and orderly referendum on self-determination for the\npeople of Western Sahara. Algeria is convinced that a just\na lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara can\npromote stability and peace in the region. We therefore\nhope that the international community, as well as the United\nNations and its Secretary-General, will redouble efforts to\nensure, in the best conditions of credibility and impartiality,\nimplementation of the United Nations settlement plan, with\nthe complete cooperation of the two parties.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13\nThe same applies to the Mediterranean region. In fact,\nAlgeria has always worked to make that region, with the\nparticipation of all the States concerned, one of peace,\nstability and mutually advantageous cooperation. It is to this\nend that we continue to work for the consolidation and\ndeepening of political agreement in our region and for the\nestablishment of new types of cooperation. Algeria is\ntherefore making constant efforts to have the forum of \\\"5 +\n5\\\" activated, as this is a promising framework for\ncooperation between North and South in the Mediterranean.\nIt is in the field of disarmament that the end of the cold\nwar has produced tangible results most rapidly. However,\nconsiderable work remains to be done, especially by the\nnuclear Powers. The final cessation of nuclear testing in all\nenvironments and the renunciation of the development of\nnew weapon systems are objectives the attainment of which\nis now within the reach of the international community -\nprovided, of course, that the nuclear Powers go beyond\ncurrent agreements and summon up the necessary political\nwill for this purpose.\nIn this context, Algeria notes with interest and with\nhope the proposals made from this rostrum on 27 September\nby the President of the United States of America. The\ncomplete elimination of all weapons of mass destruction is,\nin fact, part of the logic of history. The conclusion of the\nConvention on the prohibition of chemical weapons has\nshown that this objective is no longer Utopian. Any\napproach to the question of disarmament and international\nsecurity and, in the final analysis, to the question of peace\nshould be universal in scope. This is a conviction that is\nbeing reiterated time after time by Algeria and by the\nNon-Aligned Movement. Disarmament, if it is to be lasting,\nmust take account of all aspects of the situation, and not of\nthe military dimension alone. It is now clear that, in an\nincreasingly interdependent world, peace and security cannot\nbe dissociated from their natural corollaries - socio-economic\ndevelopment and the promotion of all human rights.\nThe protection and promotion of human rights - all\nhuman rights - is a high priority for Algeria. Therefore, we\nare pleased at the positive results of the World Conference\non Human Rights, held in Vienna, which expressed support\nfor an integrated and global approach to human rights,\nwhose civil, political, economic and social aspects reinforce\nand complement each other.\nAlgeria, which subscribes completely to this view and\nendorses this approach, is now at a juncture that makes it an\nobligation of the State to give priority to human rights, to\nprotection of the fundamental right to life and to personal\nsecurity. In this context, the restoration of public order and\nthe struggle against terrorism are manifestations of Algeria\u2019s\ndetermination to give a firm guarantee of the development\nof human rights and the building of a lasting democracy\nbased on the rule of law, the changeover of political power\nbetween parties and republican principles.\nThis declared struggle against terrorism has an internal\naspect, but it has international dimensions as well. Here we\nshould like to make it abundantly clear that Algeria will\ncontinue to oppose, firmly and with the utmost\ndetermination, every outside attempt at destabilization and\nthat it will tolerate no interference in its internal affairs. It\nis Algeria\u2019s belief that the international community must\nassert itself and mobilize its energy to defeat the modern\nbarbarity of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nIt is therefore important for the deliberations at this\nsession of the General Assembly vigorously to lead to the\nformulation of an international convention on the prevention\nand repression of terrorism.\nWhile a number of regional conflicts are on the way to\npacification and lasting settlement, others, however, there is\nno peaceful, just solution in sight.\nIn the Middle East, which has been buffeted for\ndecades by waves of suffering and confrontation, new\nprospects are emerging. Algeria welcomed the recent\nagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) and Israel and expressed the hope that it would be the\nfirst step towards an overall settlement of the Middle East\nconflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973). Now as in the past, Algeria which\nstands firmly behind the independence of decision-making by\nthe Palestinian leaders calls upon the Palestinians to close\nranks and reaffirms its support for the PLO.\nAt this crucial stage for the future of the region, Algeria\nbelieves that the international community continues to be\nresponsible for building peace. For that peace to be genuine\nand lasting, it must be comprehensive and must meet the\nnational aspirations of the Palestinian people and restore all\nthe territories occupied by Israel, including Al-Quds Al-\nSharif.\nAs an Arab country, Algeria, naturally, is intimately\ninvolved in the future of the Arab world. Overcoming the\naftermath of the Gulf war ought to open the way to the\ninter-Arab reconciliation for which our peoples fervently\nhope. Since Iraq has undertaken to meet fully all the\nobligations stemming from Security Council resolutions and\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsince international law has established the geographical basis\nfor peaceful neigbourliness between Iraq and Kuwait, we\nhope that the outstanding humanitarian questions will soon\nbe resolved so that the collective conscience of the Arab\npeoples may be able finally to heal itself of the scars of the\nGulf war.\nMy country reaffirms its support for the Government of\nthe United Arab Emirates in its legitimate efforts to regain\nsovereignty over the three islands under illegal foreign\noccupation.\nAlgeria welcomes with hope the positive developments\nin South Africa, despite the continuing violence and other\nfactors that endanger peace. The agreement to set up the\nTransitional Executive Council holds promise for the speedy\nachievement of a united, democratic, non-racial South\nAfrica. Chairman Nelson Mandela\u2019s call from this rostrum\nfor the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa is\nfurther testimony to his lofty sense of responsibility and an\nillustration of the progress that has been achieved in the\npeaceful dismantling of apartheid. This development\ndeserves the full attention of the international community,\nwhich should spare no effort in contributing to putting an\nend to the inter-ethnic violence and to provide the means by\nwhich the democratic forces can participate effectively in the\nlong-awaited elections.\nAlgeria also follows attentively developments in several\nfraternal African countries. We encourage the peace efforts\nof the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) and the relevant subregional organizations. We note\nwith satisfaction the progress achieved in Mozambique,\nRwanda and Liberia, and express the hope that those\ncountries will overcome their problems with the help of the\ninternational community and devote all their energy to\nreconstruction and development. We hope that peace and\nharmony will be restored in Angola in accordance with the\nagreements reached between the two parties and with the\nresolutions of the Security Council, which have clearly\ndetermined where the responsibilities lie.\nWe are gravely concerned about the ongoing violence\nin Somalia, particularly in Mogadishu. It reminds us that\nhumanitarian assistance and promoting political solutions\nmust go hand in hand. The tragedy of Somalia is the most\ntelling symbol to date of Africa\u2019s marginalization in\ninternational relations, and it attests to the tragic effects of\nthe international community\u2019s inadequate response to\nAfrica\u2019s clear needs with respect to economic and social\ndevelopment.\nThe tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a challenge\nto the world\u2019s conscience. In spite of the Security Council\u2019s\nmany resolutions, the acquisition of territory by force,\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and trampling of all the norms of\ninternational law continue to prevail there. In the absence of\nfirm action by the international community, the\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member\nof the United Nations, continues unabated, and puts at risk\nthe peace and stability of that country and of the region as\na whole. Algeria expresses its solidarity with the Bosnian\npeople, and most particularly with its Muslims, who have\nbeen the victim of untold hardships. We appeal to the\ninternational community to reject the fait accompli imposed\nby aggression and help protect the independence, sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nThe international situation is not disturbing at the\npolitical and security levels alone but is also causing concern\nbecause of the persistence of world recession, the\ndeteriorating economic situation of the developing countries,\nand the grave instability brought about by profound changes\nin international economic relations.\nAt a time when our interdependent world is in the\nmidst of a complex and perilous historic transition, the\ncommunication gap between North and South must come to\nan end. The universal imperative of peace, security and\ndevelopment makes us consider the developing situation in\nthe countries of the South. Most of them are facing the\nchallenges of globalization with economies made uniquely\nvulnerable by the crushing weight of foreign indebtedness,\ntheir precarious internal balance and a highly unfavourable\ninternational economic environment.\nThe efforts of developing countries to promote\neconomic growth and make the structural changes necessary\nfor development are made far more difficult and risky by the\nerosion of multilateral cooperation, the conflicting interests\nof the dominant economic players and the constraints\nimposed by economic decisions that are too often selfish and\nexclusionary.\nIt is therefore essential to respond in a concerted\nfashion to the need for an orderly restructuring of\ninternational economic relations by establishing coordinated\nmechanisms to regulate the functioning of the world\neconomy. In this context, it is important that the questions\nof debt, the scarcity of capital and technology inflows, to the\ncountries of the South, the continued decline in commodity\nprices, the deterioration of the terms of trade and the\ndifficulty of access to markets should become the focus of\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15\nthe international community\u2019s attention in order for us to\nfind lasting solutions to such problems.\nSuch a collective concerted type of action that would be\nconsonant with the requirements of adjustment by the\ndeveloping countries themselves, is a must if we are to\nrelaunch the international economy on a fair and well-\nbalanced basis and make it possible for the developing\ncountries to reap the expected benefits from the economic\nreforms they have undertaken. This would make meaningful\nthe sacrifices being made by the developing countries in\nundertaking the necessary restructuring changes aimed at\nrelaunching their economies and integrating them into the\nworld economy. It would also make it possible for the\ninternational community to learn from the experiences\nacquired in debt management and structural adjustment\nprogrammes. Lastly, it would promote the creation of a true\nmarket environment in the developing countries.\nThe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro demonstrated that\nenvironmental protection is inconceivable without the\npromotion of sustainable development and sustained growth\nin the developing countries. We must therefore work\ndeterminedly towards achieving this objective and place\nsustainable development on the agenda of the new world\norder.\nThe holding of a world summit on social development\nscheduled for 1995 to deal with problems of human security\naffords us an opportunity to engage in an international\ndialogue on the implications and results of transition in the\nworld. The United Nations and the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions must grasp these new problems and contribute to\ndeveloping a new framework for reflection and guidance to\ndirect better the evolution of the international system. This\nendeavour may seem difficult, but it is essential for a better\nunderstanding of this new order, which we wish to be\nbalanced, fair and consensual. It would also tend to support\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to draw up an agenda for\ndevelopment.\nAt a time when our Organization faces various\nchallenges, the reform, restructuring and revitalization\nprocess now under way in the United Nations acquires\nspecial importance. Restructuring the Secretariat and the\neconomic and social sectors, revitalizing the Economic and\nSocial Council, relaunching the operational development\nactivities of the United Nations system and assuring the\nstable and predictable growth of its resources are all tasks\nthat should be combined to give multilateral action the\nutmost credibility and effectiveness.\nThis undertaking is part of the vast effort to equip the\nUnited Nations for and adapt it to present and future\nchallenges, and it requires participation by all of us. This\nendeavour is the vessel for feeding the faith of the peoples\nof the United Nations in an indivisible humankind. It is\nbound to succeed so long as our more democratic and more\neffective Organization is the active centre and catalyst for\nthe promotion of fair and equitably shared development and\nthe foundation of a peace built by mankind as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea, I should like, first of all, to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly for the current session. It is our hope\nthat your efforts will crown the session with success.\nThe common task facing the international community\ntoday is to build a new, independent, peaceful and\nprosperous world. Our planet\u2019s people have an identical\naspiration: to build a new and independent world, free from\nall forms of domination and subjugation, aggression and war.\nAll countries and nations should have unrestricted freedom\nto choose and develop their own political, economic and\nsocial systems on the basis of their sovereign rights,\nincluding the right to self-determination.\nIndependence is the life and soul of each country and\nnation, and the common right of mankind. A steadfast\ncommitment to independence enables each country to\nsafeguard its national dignity and rights, to maintain and\nconsolidate international relationships on a sound basis, to\nbring about genuine democratization of international society\nand, furthermore, to help to accelerate the creation of an\nindependent world. The absence of independence will lead\nto failure to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity or to\nsecure a country\u2019s prosperity and well-being.\nIt is an ineluctable fact that where independence is\nviolated, there will be domination, subordination, subjugation\nand inequality. We draw this lesson for mankind from the\n5,000-year history of the Korean nation, and it applies to the\npresent tumultuous era, with the twenty-first century just\nround the corner.\nThe developments and events of recent years in the\ninternational arena serve to demonstrate clearly once again\nthe correctness of the independent lines and policies of our\nRepublic. We regard independence as our life and soul. It\nis the cornerstone of the internal and external policies and\napproaches of our Republic. It is our people\u2019s strong\ncommitment to independence and their principled position\nthat have enabled our country to advance along the road of\nSocialism. They have chosen this road themselves, under\nthe banner of the Juche idea, without any confusion or twists\nand turns, without any upheaval or instability.\nOur Republic has steadily consolidated and developed\nits foreign relations and has contributed to the common\ncause of mankind. We derive great satisfaction and pride\nfrom the fact that we have stood fast on the independent\nposition that we took up. Our stand is one of principle and\nconsistency: we are not at anyone\u2019s beck and call, nor do\nwe dance to anyone else\u2019s tune. In addition, we have\nalways maintained an independent position in our efforts to\nachieve peace and peaceful reunification of the country.\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNational reunification is a cause to realize the\nindependence of our nation, while the principle of national\nindependence is the inalienable fundamental principle of\nreunification. Great national unity is part and parcel of the\nprocess of the independent and peaceful reunification of the\ncountry. Great national unity is a fundamental prerequisite\nto, and an essential factor in, the country\u2019s independent and\npeaceful reunification.\nTherefore the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea has consistently subordinated everything\nto the goal of national reunification through great national\nunity incorporating the principle of national independence.\nThe whole history of the efforts for national reunification\nand in particular the prevailing situation teach us that the\nKorean people should move towards greater national unity\nof the whole nation based on the principle of independence\nin order to attain the country\u2019s reunification.\nOf course, there still exist differences in ideologies,\nideals and political systems within the nation, but these\ndifferences could be overcome without much difficulty, since\nour nation has its own intrinsic common identity that has\nbeen shaped and consolidated through the time-honoured\nhistory of 5,000 years. Our nation remains closely knit\ntogether by kinship as a homogeneous people, a unique\nentity in the world, and the whole nation, whether in the\nnorth, in the south, or abroad, is united by the common\ndesire for national reunification.\nMembers of the Korean nation should not be viewed\ndifferently based on whether they live in the north, south or\nabroad, nor should distance be put between Korean nationals\njust in order to curry favour with foreign forces. We can no\nlonger engage in antagonism and confrontation at the\nsacrifice of our great cause.\nThe inter-Korean dialogue has made such epoch-making\nprogress that the Agreement on Reconciliation,\nNon-Aggression, and Cooperation and Exchanges and the\nJoint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean\nPeninsula were adopted and effectuated in our country. This\nis intended to serve our nation\u2019s effort to end the antagonism\nand confrontation and promote reconciliation and unity and\nbreak down the wall of division to pave the way for\nreunification.\nOur nation is unanimous in its desire and aspiration to\nachieve unity, transcending all differences, and to make a\ntangible contribution to the country\u2019s reunification and the\nprosperity of the reunified country.\nThe respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, President\nof the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, has\npersonally authored and published the \\\"Ten-Point\nProgramme of Great Unity of the Whole Nation for\nReunification of the Country\\\" reflecting the desire and will\nof our nation to terminate the history of division and\nconfrontation and reunify the country.\nThis historic programme provides clarification on how\nto establish a confederal State through the application of the\nthree principles of independence, peace and great national\nunity, without any bias against either the north or south, on\nthe basis of coexistence and the equal representation of the\ntwo regional governments. The confederal State would be\nindependent, peaceful, non-aligned and neutral, maintaining\na balanced posture towards the major Powers. It also\nenvisions the protection of private or corporate capital and\nassets, and joint stock interests with foreign capital before\nand after reunification. The Ten-Point Programme of Great\nUnity of the Whole Nation for Reunification of the Country,\nwhich aims to bring about the country\u2019s reunification on the\nprinciple of the spirit of national independence, is a charter\nof national unity and reunification which reflects most\ncomprehensively the will and the aspirations of the Korean\nnation and takes into full consideration the current\ninternational situation. It calls not only on the supporters of\nreunification but also on those who have feared or remained\nonlookers to reunification to take a stand for the cause of\nnational unity and reunification. The programme also opens\nup positive prospects for achieving the historical cause of the\ncountry\u2019s reunification within the 1990s. Although obstacles\nand difficulties still stand in the way of reunification, the\nentire Korean people will definitely achieve national\nreunification in great unity, by displaying patriotism and the\nspirit of national independence.\nAt present, the relaxation of tension and establishment\nof peace on the Korean peninsula presents itself as an urgent\nissue, the solution of which allows for no further delay.\nWith a view to easing tension and achieving a durable\npeace on the Korean peninsula, the Korean Armistice\nAgreement should, inter alia, be replaced with a peace\nagreement. In reality, the Korean Armistice Agreement has\nalready become outdated and the armistice mechanism\nremains in fact paralysed. The continuance in place of the\nout-of-date armistice arrangements is primarily responsible\nfor a series of complicated and sensitive issues, including the\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula - issues still remaining\nto be resolved.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 13\nThe fact that the state of cease-fire and the armistice\narrangements of the 1950s remain unchanged even after 40\nyears is in itself abnormal. It is thanks to the peace-loving\npolicy and the will of the Government of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea that peace and security have\nbeen maintained so far on the Korean peninsula. Only the\nreplacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a\npeace agreement will lead to a full and satisfactory\nresolution of all the issues, including the nuclear issue, will\nremove hostility in inter-Korean relations and will work in\nfavour of peace in Korea and its peaceful reunification.\nSuch being the case, if the United Nations continues\nlosing sight of the fundamental issues related to peace on the\nKorean peninsula and instead preoccupies itself with non-\nessential issues, it will only throw obstacles in the way of a\nsolution of the Korean question. The United Nations should\ndirect its primary attention to the replacement of the Korean\nArmistice Agreement with a peace agreement, and play its\ndue role in terminating the armistice system and establishing\na new peace arrangement.\nWe believe this is the right time for the United Nations\nto make an innovative decision to dissolve the United\nNations Forces Command in south Korea and to replace the\nKorean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in\naccordance with resolution 3390 (XXX) B adopted by the\nthirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nIn this connection we maintain that negotiations among the\nparties concerned should begin at the earliest possible time\nto work out a new peace arrangement that will replace the\npresent armistice system.\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is another\nessential factor in building a durable peace and security\nthere.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea remains committed to its consistent position of\nturning the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone.\nAs we have made clear more than once, we have no nuclear\nweapons; we have neither the intention nor the need to\ndevelop these weapons, nor the financial resources to support\ntheir production. We would not object to inspection of our\nnuclear facilities, but only when impartiality is fully\nguaranteed.\nAs shown by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea-United States of America talks, the nuclear issue on\nthe Korean peninsula is a political issue to be resolved\nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the\nUnited States of America. It is to be recalled that here in\nNew York last June the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States of America issued a joint\nstatement containing their policy commitments related to a\nfundamental resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean\npeninsula.\nThe joint statement clarifies, in unambiguous terms,\nprinciples of assurances against the threat and use of force\nincluding nuclear weapons; peace and security in a\nnuclear-free Korean peninsula, including impartial\napplication of full-scope safeguards, mutual respect for each\nother\u2019s sovereignty, and non-interference in each other\u2019s\ninternal affairs; and support for the peaceful reunification of\nKorea.\nAt the second round of talks in Geneva, the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea delegation put forward a\nproposal on replacing its existing graphite-moderated\nreactors and associated nuclear facilities with light-water\nmoderated reactors, thus demonstrating with more clarity the\ntransparency and integrity of its non-nuclear policy.\nIf all the commitments the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America have\nagreed upon are translated into practice - including\nassurances against the threat and use of force, including\nnuclear weapons, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy\nthrough light-water moderated reactors, plus the negative\nsecurity assurances - then the prospects will open up for a\nfundamental and final resolution of the nuclear issue on the\nKorean peninsula and the basis for the improvement of\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea - United States of\nAmerica relations will be laid down. Furthermore,\nepoch-making progress will be made in reducing tensions on\nthe Korean peninsula and in ensuring peace and security in\nAsia and the rest of the world.\nInitial and meaningful progress in the efforts to resolve\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the outcome of\nthe negotiations by the responsible parties. This vividly\nproves that the only way to resolve the nuclear issue on the\nKorean peninsula lies in dialogue and negotiations.\nHowever, we regret to note that a certain amount of\npressure has been renewed by those forces that still remain\nobsessed with an outdated way of thinking at the time when\nthe talks between the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the United States of America aimed at resolving\nthe nuclear issue are under way and consultations between\nour country and the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA) have been conducted.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe so-called resolution on our \\\"nuclear issue\\\" was\nadopted at the thirty-seventh session of the General\nConference of the IAEA, which was held some time ago.\nThis act cannot but be viewed as the product of political\nconspiracy to impede, by all means, the solution of nuclear\nissues through negotiations and to stifle our Republic.\nWe regard the adoption of the \\\"resolution\\\" itself at the\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA as a wanton violation of\nour Republic\u2019s sovereignty and part of sinister political\noffensive aimed at forcing international pressure upon us.\nThe whole process of the General Conference of the\nIAEA held recently has eloquently shown that the measures\ntaken in the past by the secretariat and Board of Governors\nwere unjustifiable, and, accordingly, the agency has lost\nface and integrity in the process of solving the \\\"nuclear\nissue\\\".\nThe \\\"nuclear issue\\\" of the Korean peninsula can be\nresolved only through talks between the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea and the United States of America, either\nin the light of its political character or its origin.\nAccordingly, two rounds of such talks have been held so far,\nwhich is well known to the world. This notwithstanding, it\nis absurd that the Japanese Prime Minister and the South\nKorean Foreign Minister picked a quarrel with us in this\naugust Assembly a few days ago, clamouring about\n\\\"implementing the safeguards agreement\\\" and \\\"international\nconcern about development of nuclear weapons\\\". Japan\nshould not mention the fictitious \\\"development of nuclear\nweapons\\\", but should give up its attempt to become a\nmilitary Power and to realize its aim of nuclear armament,\nwhich it is accelerating under this pretext.\nThe south Korean authorities should discontinue\nnuclear-war exercises with foreign forces against fellow\ncountrymen and should not pursue so-called international\nmutual assistance systems either.\nOur country, as a member of international society, will\nimplement its commitment to the just and early solution of\nthe nuclear issue.\nI hope that all the States Members of the United\nNations will lend encouragement to the Democratic People\u2019s\nRepublic of Korea\u2019s position in favour of a negotiated\nresolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and\nfully cooperate in taking practical measures to help\nimplement the points agreed upon at the talks between the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and the United\nStates of America.\nThe peace-loving position of the Government of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to turn the Korean\npeninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone remains unchanged,\nand we shall continue our sincere efforts in the future, too,\nto remove the nuclear threat fundamentally and resolve the\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\nToday the world situation and international relations\ncall for an early liquidation of the legacies of the cold-war\nera that have been negated by history and the prevention of\nall sorts of attempts to reverse the forward movement of\nhistory.\nUniversal disarmament and the abolition world wide of\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are\nmost urgent in eliminating the residue of the cold-war era\nand attaining peace and security in the world. Everything\nthat threatens the survival of mankind and the devastation of\nsociety\u2019s treasures should be abolished.\nThe recent moratorium on nuclear testing introduced by\ncertain nuclear-weapon States can be called a step forward,\nin the light of the fact that nuclear testing itself is the most\ndangerous nuclear arms race among the nuclear Powers and\na major source of nuclear proliferation. It is our view that,\nalong with the permanent ban on nuclear testing, epoch--\nmaking steps should be taken to destroy a colossal number\nof the nuclear weapons accumulated on the globe and all\nsorts of nuclear weapons deployed in other countries. In\nparticular, nuclear weapons deployed on the Korean\npeninsula and its surrounding regions should be dismantled.\nWithout this solution, any talk about international nuclear\nnon-proliferation and world-wide nuclear disarmament is\nsenseless.\nThe existence of military blocs and the presence of\nforeign military bases and troops in other countries are the\nproducts of cold-war policy and are permanent factors\nthreatening world peace and security. Now that the old\nstructure of the cold war has collapsed, there is no\njustification whatsoever for the existence of the military\nblocs and their means for waging wars of aggression. The\nmilitary blocs established under the pretext of the so-called\nbalance of forces during the cold-war era should be\ndissolved. Furthermore, the presence of foreign military\nbases and troops in other countries is a violation of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of those nations. This\nruns counter to the trend towards independence of the\npresent era. We demand the closing of all foreign military\nbases in various parts of the world and the unconditional\nwithdrawal of foreign troops therefrom.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 15\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes between countries\nand nations is one of the important issues in safeguarding\nworld peace and security at present. In different parts of the\nworld we are now witnessing the trampling underfoot of\nnational sovereignty and the escalation of regional, religious\nand ethnic disputes into full-fledged wars. This has been\ndisturbing peace and security in some regions, and some\ncountries are suffering from severe disasters. Disputes\nbetween countries should be resolved through negotiations\nbetween the parties concerned in order to meet their mutual\ninterests and serve the cause of world peace.\nAs long as the structure of the existing inequitable\ninternational economic order remains the same, it is\nimpossible to eliminate the ever-widening gap between rich\nand poor, between the developed and the developing\ncountries and save the developing nations from poverty,\ndisease and disasters. The developed countries must accept\nresponsibility for this and refrain from any actions\ndetrimental to the economic development of the developing\ncountries. This was specifically highlighted in the resolution\nand recommendations adopted by the Tenth Conference of\nHeads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned\nCountries. Constructive measures should be taken to resume\ndialogue between the developed and developing countries,\nreform the inequitable international economic order and\nestablish a new, equitable international economic order.\nAlong with this, the developing countries should adopt\npractical measures to realize South-South cooperation,\nstarting from such priority fields as food, agriculture, public\nhealth and so on, in an effort to overcome their economic\npoverty and establish a South-South economic order.\nThe historic tasks and responsibilities the United\nNations has assumed before mankind are growing heavier\nwith each passing day, and the world watches the role of the\nUnited Nations and its activities. The United Nations should\nbe democratized to meet the requirements of the present\nsituation and the aspirations of its Member States, according\nto the principles of independence, equality and impartiality.\nThe important point here is that all Member States\nshould be left to fully exercise their sovereignty, regardless\nof differences in size of population or territory, whether\nstrong or weak, rich or poor. All countries and nations are\nequal members in international society and are entitled to\nequal rights.\nIn the world there are big and small countries, but there\ncannot be senior or junior countries; there are developed and\nless developed nations, but there cannot be dominating\nnations and nations destined to be dominated by others.\nWe stand against any privileges being given to any\nparticular nation in international relations. We call for\nuniversal adherence to the principles of mutual respect and\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others, for equality\nand mutual benefits, and for friendship and cooperation\namong all the countries to be based on these principles.\nIn the international arena today, some forces are\nresorting to anachronistic actions; in violation of impartiality\nand international justice, these forces connive at actions on\nthe part of certain countries that violate international norms\non a number of issues, including the nuclear issue, the\nhuman rights situation and terrorism, while pretending to be\nignorant of them. At the same time, they accuse those\ncountries that disobey them of a \\\"nuclear threat\\\", of \\\"human\nrights violations\\\" and of \\\"State-sponsored terrorism\\\",\nimposing unacceptable pressure on them.\nUnjustifiable and unreasonable actions by a few\ncountries that resort to strong-arm tactics and high-handed\nbehaviour while interfering in the internal affairs of others\nand applying a double standard to the practice of\ninternational relations must no longer be tolerated.\nThe United Nations should undergo restructuring and\nimprovement. Such important measures are needed to meet\nmore effectively the changed reality and new challenges.\nPrimary attention should be paid to reviewing and\nreadjusting the composition of the permanent membership of\nthe United Nations Security Council. As the non-aligned\nand other developing countries form a majority of the United\nNations membership, they should exercise their voice on an\nequivalent basis and should not be denied the opportunity to\ntake part in the process of resolving major international\nissues. We hold that the third world countries should, as a\nmatter of course, be included in the permanent membership\nof the United Nations Security Council, in proportion to the\nnumbers of their members in the Organization.\nAt present, Japan is launching a public relations\ncampaign to gain a seat as a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council. But Japan is not assuming its due\nresponsibility for the acts of aggression and war crimes\ncommitted during the Second World War and has so far\nfailed to make a clean slate of its past. Therefore, it is not\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nreasonable to talk about its qualification for permanent\nmembership.\nOnly when the United Nations measures up to its own\nresponsibilities and role on an unprejudiced basis can it take\nits rightful place as the international Organization that serves\ninternational justice and champions world peace; only then\nwill it be able to meet the expectations of its Member States.\nThe destiny of each country and nation is closely\ninterlinked with the common destiny of mankind.\nThe world\u2019s people advocating independence should\nwork together in unity to consolidate their respective national\nindependence, to further their countries\u2019 independent\ndevelopment, and to contribute actively to a stronger world\npeace and security.\nWe fully support the Cambodian people in their efforts\nto promote national reconciliation, unity and rehabilitation,\nas we do the peoples of the member States of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations in their endeavours\nto establish a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in\nSouth-East Asia, and we support other Asian people in their\nstruggle to build a new, independent, peaceful and\nprosperous Asia.\nWe would like to express our firm solidarity with the\nPalestinian and all the other Arab peoples who are engaged\nin efforts towards a fair and lasting solution of the Middle\nEast question, including the Palestinian question; to the\nentire African people in their struggle to overcome\nsocio-economic difficulties and achieve the independent\ndevelopment of their countries; to the Cuban people in their\nstruggle to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty and dignity and\nthe gains of socialism; and to the Latin American peoples in\ntheir efforts towards peace and prosperity.\nThe Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea and the Korean people will offer active support and\nfirm solidarity to the people of all countries throughout the\nworld who are struggling to oppose all sorts of domination\nand subjugation, to build a new society and to promote the\ncommon cause of mankind.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is guided\nby its consistent ideals of independence, peace and\nfriendship in international relations, and these ideals coincide\nwith the ideals of international society.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will\ncontinue to hold fast to independence, to further strengthen\ncontacts and cooperation with United Nations Member\nStates, and to remain faithful to the common cause of\nmankind for global independence.\nThe delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea wishes, in conclusion, to express its hope that at its\ncurrent session the General Assembly will have a successful\ndiscussion of all the agenda items placed before it at this\nsession through the concerted efforts of all the\nrepresentatives of the various countries, thus contributing to\nbuilding a new, free and peaceful world.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure\nto see an eminent son of Guyana guiding this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. Sri Lanka and Guyana\nhave a long tradition of cooperation at the United Nations,\nin the Non-Aligned Movement and in the Commonwealth.\nSri Lanka also expresses its appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, who presided\nover the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nBefore I proceed, may I take this opportunity, on behalf\nof the Government and the people of Sri Lanka, to express\nour profound sorrow over the terrible tragedy that has struck\nthe people of India in the wake of the devastating earthquake\nthis week.\nI bring best wishes from His Excellency\nDingiri Banda Wijetunga, President of Sri Lanka, and best\nwishes for the success of this session of the Assembly in its\nendeavours for world peace.\nSri Lanka welcomes the new Member States admitted\nto the United Nations this year.\nWe thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication and\ncourageous leadership in meeting the challenges of peace\nand development that lie ahead.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 37\nIt is four years since I last addressed the Assembly.\nOur hopes voiced at that time for the post-cold-war global\norder are now being realized, although there are problems of\ninstability in the international arena.\nThe current international political trend gives us fresh\nhope of relations being conducted between States in\naccordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\nRegarding Palestine, Sri Lanka has welcomed the\nmutual recognition between the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization and Israel. We hope that the interim\narrangements now being worked out will lead eventually to\na comprehensive and durable settlement of the Palestinian\nproblem in all its aspects.\nIn South Africa, the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s resolute\nopposition to apartheid and its advocacy of a free,\ndemocratic and non-racial South Africa stands vindicated.\nAs President Nelson Mandela described it last week, \\\"the\ncountdown to democracy\\\" in South Africa has begun.\nCambodia, a founding member of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, is now free. We welcome this development and\ncongratulate the United Nations on its role.\nThese developments certainly give us encouragement\nand hope. But this does not mean that the world is now free\nfrom tension and disputes.\nThe situation in Bosnia gives grounds for a vote of\nno-confidence on the political leadership of our times. It is\na situation which has shocked the world. It is clear that the\ninternational community is still incapable of rising above\nnarrow and parochial considerations. It is vital that an early\nsolution be found which will meet the aspirations of all the\nparties concerned.\nWe have watched with alarm the rising tide of racism\nin many countries, which violates the very foundations of\ntheir cherished goals and objectives. It is not relevant here\nto diagnose the causes, but these dangerous and ugly trends\nmust be checked. This is not just a challenge to\nGovernments alone. All men and women of good will must\njoin together to fight this evil.\nThe implementation of recent arms-limitation\nagreements and the shelving of plans to extend the arms race\ninto outer space have enhanced the prospects for genuine\ndisarmament. Since 1991 world defence spending has been\nset on a downward course. We must bring about a\nsuccessful conclusion to the 1995 conference on the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\nSri Lanka is pleased at the recent successful conclusion\nof the Convention on chemical weapons.\nAt the same time, genuine disarmament must also\nincorporate measures to reduce the flows of conventional\narms. The uncontrolled movement of arms and explosives\nto extremist fringe groups threatens to destabilize small\ncountries.\nIn a similar context, Sri Lanka wishes to draw the\nAssembly\u2019s attention to the initiative to enforce an\ninternational ban on the use of mines in warfare. The tragic\nconsequences of mine warfare are visible in the thousands of\namputees in many parts of the world and call for urgent\ninternational attention.\nToday it is widely recognized that security can no\nlonger be reduced to military considerations alone. Security\nmust take account of economic crises, poverty, hunger, mass\nmigrations, international terrorism and environmental\npollution. These developments require the revitalization of\nthe United Nations.\nIn 1995, the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. The founding principle of the United Nations -\nthe sovereign equality of all States - remains valid today.\nThe Secretary-General has emphasized this principle in his\nreport \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". The principle of sovereign\nequality must be put into practice if the bold proposals in\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" are to succeed.\nAs the transition to a new global order continues, the\nUnited Nations will come under greater pressure to live up\nto its ideals. However, in order to command the widest\npossible support, the United Nations must operate on the\nbasis of an acceptable set of guiding principles. With regard\nto national disputes, United Nations intervention must be\nconsidered only upon the request of the Member State\nconcerned. Indigenous peace efforts must be encouraged\nand respected.\nRegionalism has received a new impetus. The United\nNations should extend its fullest cooperation to these\nregional trends and initiatives. A lingering obstacle to\nregional unity is the question of border disputes. The\nNon-Aligned Movement has made useful proposals in this\nregard, including the suggestion by Sri Lanka that a border\ndisputes commission be formed. Most recently, the Security\nCouncil itself had to lend its authority to resolve the border\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ndispute between Kuwait and Iraq, and we support all\nrelevant Security Council resolutions in that regard.\nLet me now turn to South Asia, my own region,\nconsisting of seven States and accounting for over 1 billion\npeople. Some 12 years ago, I had the pleasure of\ninaugurating, in Colombo, the first meeting to launch the\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\n(SAARC). Since then, it has been a matter of constant\nsatisfaction to note the steady development of regional\ncooperation in South Asia. Today, we had the pleasure of\nhearing the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, current Chairman\nof SAARC, under whose able leadership SAARC is moving\nforward. Last year, during the period of our chairmanship,\nSri Lanka guided SAARC in several new directions. These\nincluded poverty alleviation, the establishment of the South\nAsian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), the South\nAsia Development Fund and a Charter for Children. In Sri\nLanka\u2019s view, SAARC should now extend its horizon\nbeyond economic and social cooperation.\nWith a view to sharing our regional experience with the\ninternational community, Sri Lanka supports the subject of\npoverty alleviation as a major theme for consideration at the\nforthcoming World Social Summit. It is our firm conviction\nthat structural adjustment programmes in developing\ncountries must provide a safety net for the poorest of the\npoor until the fruits of economic growth are widely\ndistributed throughout society.\nYesterday, we commemorated the third anniversary of\nthe World Summit for Children. Within SAARC, we have\nalready set ourselves certain attainable mid-decade goals for\nmeeting the basic needs of the children of South Asia. We\nwelcome the World Conference on Women in Beijing as an\nopportunity to focus world attention on issues related to\nwomen and development.\nAs an island nation, Sri Lanka has special interest in\ninternational endeavours to create a new legal regime of the\noceans. In 1971, the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a\nzone of peace was proposed by Sri Lanka. The world scene\nhas since changed and the time has now come to examine\nnew, alternative approaches. Yet another regional initiative\nby Sri Lanka is the Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Conference\n(IOMAC), a cooperative endeavour to develop the region\u2019s\nmarine resources.\nThe commitment of the Sri Lanka Government to\nensuring the human rights of all our citizens is central to all\nour policies, and we will maintain our policy of candid\ncooperation with the United Nations. The dictates of\nhumanitarian law must be respected. Where economic\nsanctions are invoked as a tool of punitive action, let us\nensure that the humanitarian needs of the people of the\ncountry involved are fully protected.\nNeither the end of the cold war nor the new thrust of\neconomic liberalism has in any way diminished Sri Lanka\u2019s\ncommitment to non-aligned principles. At the Jakarta\nSummit, there was a consensus that the political campaigns\nagainst racism, colonialism and apartheid had now been\nlargely completed. The central unresolved issue of our time\nremains the economic disparities between the developed and\nthe developing countries. Economic interdependence is a\nglobal reality. We reiterate the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s\nappeal to the developed countries to consider favourably the\ncall for a new compact on development between the North\nand the South, a new liberal democratic partnership for\nglobal economic solutions. There is now a relative\nabundance of liquidity in private markets. Access to these\nresources is not easily affordable for the developing\ncountries because of the private market rates. A mechanism\nis therefore needed to bridge what is available and what is\naffordable. Such an initiative is most urgent in view of the\neconomic difficulties facing developing countries.\nFurthermore, today there is increased need for global\neconomic cooperation owing to the emergence of many new\nStates. All the needed assistance must be provided for these\nnew States to complete their journey to democracy. But this\nmust not be achieved at the expense of other developing\ncountries.\nIn South Asia, we have embarked on policies of\nexport-led growth and trade and foreign-exchange\nliberalization. We have done so despite the severe effects on\nus of unfavourable trends in commodity prices and\nprotectionist measures in the markets of developed countries.\nOur efforts at national and regional levels will succeed only\nif there is a reciprocal commitment to free-trade policies at\nthe international level. In this connection, it is imperative\nthat the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations be concluded\nsoon, in a fair and just manner. We hope that the\nindustrialized countries will be able to resolve the issues that\ndivide them. At the same time, however, they must not\nconcentrate on their own problems to the exclusion of a\nbalanced result for all participants in the negotiations.\nSri Lanka is an island nation with a unique commitment\nto social welfare. For many years, it needed virtually no\nbudget for defence. When terrorism broke out in such force,\nmany thought Sri Lanka would disintegrate.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 39\nMost recently, the world was shocked by the brutal\nassassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, the duly\nelected Head of State. This act of terrorism, aimed at\ndestabilizing the country, was confounded by the peaceful\ntransfer of power within 24 hours, thus vindicating the\nstrength and maturity of Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutional and\ndemocratic system.\nThe Government has never wavered from its objective\nof seeking a political solution to the North-East conflict. I\nmyself have spent some 14 months negotiating with armed\ngroups, to find a peaceful solution acceptable to all. During\nthese 14 months, there was peace in the North and the East\nbut, unfortunately, at the end of this period these groups\nbroke off negotiations for reasons undisclosed to me. I also\npresided for one and a half years over the All-Party\nConference, which examined the question of a political\nsolution for over eight months.\nA Select Committee of Parliament, chaired by an\nOpposition Member of Parliament, has been working over\nmany months to reach a political settlement. Thus the\nsearch for a political solution continues. In the thick of the\nconflict we have maintained the flow of food, medical and\nother supplies, and services such as education and health to\nthe affected areas. Many have acknowledged that this is an\nexceptional achievement.\nOn the economic front, the Government has steadfastly\nfollowed open economic policies since 1977. As a result,\nSri Lanka is today well on the road to attaining newlyindustrialized-economy status. Foreign investment recorded\na quantum jump last year, clearly reflecting investor\nconfidence in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic stability and\npredictability. It is our firm conviction that in a\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural society, sustained economic\ngrowth is the best defence against divisive forces.\nWhen I addressed the Assembly in 1988, I suggested\nthat we project our vision beyond this building, and beyond\nthe resolutions and speeches, to focus on the impact of our\nwork on the millions of people we represent.\nIt would be wise to remind ourselves that the\nmaintenance of world peace is multidimensional and the\nUnited Nations political agenda must go hand in hand with\nits development agenda.\nOur nations are all travellers together on the road to the\nfuture. How will the future judge us? It will not be by our\nmilitary victories and parades of power, nor by our eloquent\ndebates and sophisticated slogans. We will be judged by our\nsuccess in turning weapons into tools of development, in\nbanishing poverty, hunger, disease and ignorance and in\nlearning to live in a sustainable environment in harmony\nwith a fragile and finite world.\n"

        "file_text": " I extend\ncongratulations to His Excellency Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of Guyana on his election to the presidency of this\nsession of the General Assembly. May I also thank His\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria for his\ncontribution to the success of the previous session. In\naddition, I should like to stress the deep appreciation of the\nPolish Government for the work and accomplishments of the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations over the past year.\nLet me first speak about some of the timely goals and\ntasks of our Organization. I should like to start by\ndiscussing the role of the United Nations in organizing peace\nafter the cold war. In the post-cold-war era, the United\nNations is facing growing expectations and responsibilities.\nThat trend will continue over the coming years. In an\nincreasingly interdependent world the United Nations,\ndespite its shortcomings and limitations, offers the best\navenue for addressing those global problems that are still\nunresolved and for meeting new challenges as well. The\nOrganization faces the task of creating a better, more\ndemocratic and just world. In fact, we badly need a vision\nof such a world. More often than not, we have to ask\nourselves these questions: Are we rising to the occasion?\nHow should we resolve the present crisis of leadership, both\nwithin individual States and on the international level?\nThe United Nations provides an appropriate platform\nfor shaping the vision I am talking about. To begin with, it\nshould be based on the assessment of geopolitical and\ngeoeconomic conditions, in particular on the assumption that\nthe world has become pluralistic, whatever the size and\nweight of States in international affairs. It should also\nreflect an increased awareness of the need for a multilateral\napproach to solving problems.\nFour years have elapsed since the end of the cold war.\nWe must not merely adjust to the new situation, but mould\nit, in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution. The\npresent crisis has many facets. Today, its primary source is\nunresolved economic and social issues, as well as such\npolitical problems as territorial disputes and ethnic tensions.\nBut we have to remember that the process of finding\nanswers to these issues will unavoidably lead in the future\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 37\nto a new alignment of power among States and, as a result,\nwe shall then face the prospect of recourse to force. That\nquestion has been partly addressed by the Secretary-General\nin his \\\"Agenda for Peace.\\\" The matter has very broad\nramifications, and we still have not elaborated a grand\nstrategy of democratic transformation. I think that the\nUnited Nations should start exploring, in a more systemic\nmanner, its role in the world as it is now and as it will be\nbeyond the year 2000. One of the preparatory steps might\nbe the preparation of a report on the United Nations as a\nleader of global change and the promoter of a new world\norder after the cold war. Such an assignment could be\nentrusted to most-knowledgeable individuals, research\ninstitutes, transnational corporations and others. The report\nwould serve as a basis for spelling out the future\nresponsibilities of the United Nations and the Member\nStates.\nWe need a thorough re-examination of the priorities of\nthe United Nations and, consequently, of the whole United\nNations system. The main purpose of reform would be to\nadapt the United Nations to the requirements of peace after\nthe cold war. Reform should take into account ongoing\nchanges in Member States. This applies, in particular, to\ncountries in transition, not only in Central and Eastern\nEurope but also in various parts of other continents. Let me\ntake this opportunity to add that Poland is firmly and\nirreversibly committed to the political and economic\ntransformation it started in 1989, and that its foreign policy\nhas stable priorities.\nThe fate of the countries in the process of\ntransformation is not their problem alone. Their success or\nfailure is unavoidably going to exert a strong impact on\nother States. The international community should not fail to\nback up the transformation process and to assist the new\ndemocracies in their continuing efforts to achieve reform,\neconomic recovery, social progress and full participation in\ninternational exchanges. Such an approach would assist\nthem in their swifter integration into the world economic\nsystem.\nThe military factor of security retains its significance,\nalthough it differs from that of the cold-war era. The United\nNations has developed a disarmament agenda. The signing\nof the chemical weapons Convention by almost 150 States\nshows how the new political climate facilitates long-awaited\nagreements and brings us closer to a world free of weapons\nof mass destruction. We hope that there will be similar\npositive developments in nuclear disarmament. The\ninitiation of negotiations on a comprehensive ban on nuclear\ntesting constitutes a big step in that direction. The United\nNations should also deal with the threat posed by the\npossible spread of nuclear-weapon capabilities and the\nproliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. Poland\nattaches great importance to thorough and constructive\npreparations for the 1995 Review Conference of the Parties\nto the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nI should now like to turn to the subject of human rights.\nThere are a number of reasons why, after the Vienna\nConference, the Organization should devote much of its\nattention to human rights. In doing so, I believe, it should\nreflect on these words used by Secretary-General Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali in addressing the high-level segment of the\nEconomic and Social Council:\n\\\"The United Nations is, by its very essence, universal,\nglobal and inclusive. It is made up of sovereign States,\nyet crucially concerned with the well-being of\nindividuals. Its concern with individuals, with their\nsocieties and with world society is not, as some would\nclaim, inherently contradictory.\\\"\nThere are differences of opinion on the scope of human\nrights, on State responsibilities in regard to their observance\nand on the role of the international community in monitoring\nthem. The United Nations organs must expand their\nnegotiating and mediatory capacities and show much skill in\novercoming these divergences. The essential criteria are\nmorality, the inherent dignity of the human person and the\nrule of law. Human rights must express the common values\nof the international community. Their implementation is\nbecoming one of the preconditions of worldwide stability\nand security.\nFundamental human rights are universal; their substance\nis absolute and unrelated to circumstances. But saying this\ndoes not mean that we are closing our eyes to the existence\nof many different cultures and traditions in the historical\ndevelopment of the various regions of the world. This\nshould be duly taken into account; however, it cannot justify\nany violations of human rights or non-execution of the\nrelevant instruments. There is no room for treating criticism\nof such unlawful policies and lawful attempts to redress\nthem as an infringement of the sovereignty of States. In\npromoting, developing and effectively defending human\nrights, the United Nations should make these activities part\nof its cooperation with States.\nInternational peace and security, sustainable\ndevelopment and human rights are the three closely related\nareas on which the United Nations should concentrate. \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\", Agenda 21 and the forthcoming agenda\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nfor development should, in my view, be complemented by\nan agenda for human rights. With the results of the Vienna\nConference kept in mind, the Agenda for Human Rights\nwould constitute a plan of action for setting standards and\nimplementing rights and preventing violations.\nIndividuals need better and easier access to international\nprotection of their rights and freedoms. The Organization\nshould revise the grievance procedures and make them more\nuniversal. While assuming that the Second and Third\nCommittees will merge into one Economic and Social\nCommittee, Poland would suggest the establishment of a\nHuman Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Committee as one\nof the main Committees of the General Assembly. We\nrecommend expanding the responsibilities, competence and\nrank of the Commission on Human Rights. We also\nsupport, as a matter of urgency, the proposal to create an\noffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nFurther, we should explore means of promoting human\nrights on a regional level. A small bureau, which might be\nlocated in Warsaw, could be entrusted with monitoring\nhuman rights observance in Eastern Europe. This is a\nsensitive region. Such a bureau would be part of the Geneva\noffice. I have suggested Warsaw because bodies of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the\nCouncil of Europe already operate there, a fact that could\nfacilitate cooperation between the United Nations and the\nEuropean institutions in that field. The region provides\nmuch insight into how democracy and human rights are\nbeing implemented in States that are undergoing democratic\ntransformation.\nOne aspect of human rights has become very critical of\nlate. I am referring to the increasing violations of\nhumanitarian law in armed conflicts, whether international or\ndomestic. As the President of the International Committee\nof the Red Cross emphasized during the recent International\nConference on the Protection of Victims of War, held in\nGeneva, the practice has undergone a change for the worse.\nWith even greater frequency, civilian populations are\nbecoming the hostages and primary targets of fighting\nwarlords. Each and every day the mass media bring us\nscenes of the atrocities of war. We in the United Nations\nmust not be indifferent to these facts. Poland joins the call\nfor urgent action to revive the observance of humanitarian\nlaw and to uphold the authority of the Geneva Conventions\nas well as their additional Protocols. The Polish\nGovernment strongly endorses the Declaration adopted by\nthe Conference on the protection of war victims. In our\nview, the international community should pay particular\nattention to the observance of human rights and humanitarian\nstandards in internal strife. War crimes should not go\nunpunished.\nThe third task to which I wish to draw the attention of\nthe General Assembly is development. The growing gap\nbetween rich and poor nations is a significant source of\ntensions and conflicts. Even Europe has not been spared,\nthreatened as it is by the emergence of a new \\\"curtain\\\", this\none economic. I am confident that the agenda for\ndevelopment under preparation will comprehensively deal\nwith the various aspects of this potential danger. We need\na new development paradigm that is people-oriented: human\nrights have their economic dimension. Economic and social\ndifficulties have a decisive impact on international security\nand global stability, and often lead to human rights\nviolations. The main thing is to create a spirit of partnership\nand solidarity. We expect the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995, to specify\nthe necessary tasks in social development and thereby\nreinforce sustainable economic development.\nI shall now discuss some procedures and methods\nwhich are particularly topical in view of the goals and tasks\nI have enumerated. I will speak first of the settlement and\nmanagement of disputes. The new world situation calls for\nrenewed and growing attention to international law, its\nimplementation and application. Poland welcomes the\nenlargement, limited though it still is, of the compulsory\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. It would\nalso be highly desirable if further withdrawals of\nreservations to the jurisdictional clauses of treaties followed.\nPoland supports the Secretary-General\u2019s call upon all\nMember States to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the\nCourt before the end of the United Nations Decade of\nInternational Law in the year 2000. By means of its\nadvisory jurisdiction, the Court might deal with such\nquestions as the legal components of political decisions, the\nreview of administrative action or the relationship between\nsome of the main organs of the United Nations.\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes requires a new\napproach. Traditional means, as listed in Article 33 of the\nCharter might, depending on the merits of each case, be\ncombined with peace-keeping, peace-building or even\nenforcement measures. We must distinguish between\nvarious phases or component parts of the same conflict\nwhere each phase will require a different approach or a\ndifferent procedure. And let us not forget that there are a\ngrowing number of conflicts which cannot simply be\n\\\"settled\\\", at any rate in the foreseeable future. They should,\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 39\nrather, be \\\"managed\\\". All this opens up new vistas for the\nskilful use of various United Nations mechanisms.\nNow I wish to say a few words about peace-keeping.\nIt is a subject that is high on the United Nations agenda.\nThe success and therefore the image of the United Nations\nare at stake here. The \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has set out a\nconceptual framework. Preventive diplomacy,\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and, in particular, enforcement\nrequire sound guidelines, procedures and detailed planning\nin operational terms. Though a great deal of work has\nalready been accomplished, much more remains to be done.\nThe problems with the clarity of the mandate of the\npeace-keeping operations, their time frame, management and\nfrugality also require the special attention of the United\nNations.\nBearing in mind the alarming number of casualties\namong both military and civilian peace-keepers, Poland fully\nsupports the idea of the expeditious elaboration of a\nuniversally binding legal instrument, possibly in the form of\na convention on the safety and security of the personnel of\npeace-keeping operations. The United Nations should not\nundertake new operations without clearly identified\nobjectives. What is involved is trust in the Organization and\nits prospective contribution to the security of all of us.\nRegional conflicts figure prominently on the United\nNations agenda. In specific cases regional institutions could\nbe helpful, as not all regions have such ready mechanisms\nfor dealing with conflict situations. However, they could\nstrive to establish them. The Security Council, also, could\nplay a role in appropriate instances. The importance of the\nregional effort is particularly relevant to Africa, which is\nfacing many specific difficulties and problems. We should\ndevote more attention to that continent. Poland supports the\ninitiatives and programmes that aim at the peaceful\nsettlement of conflicts and at the creation or strengthening of\ndemocratic institutions in Africa.\nIn view of the fundamental constitutional reforms now\nunder way in the Republic of South Africa, Poland favours\nthe lifting of sanctions and other restrictions imposed on that\ncountry.\nRecent developments in the Middle East have shown a\ngenuine will to arrive at a compromise and achieve a\npeaceful settlement. Poland shares the view that it would be\nappropriate for the General Assembly to endorse the peace\nprocess and call for regional cooperation in the Middle East.\nAt the same time, the Assembly should refrain from\nrepeating such resolutions as could harm this delicate\nprocess.\nWe believe that the present scale of the conflict in\nBosnia and Herzegovina could have been avoided had the\ninternational community, especially Europe, reacted when\nthere was still time. Obviously, I am aware of the fact that\nin a conflict whose components are both internal and\ninternational, the influence of non-parties is rather limited,\nand the solution must finally come from within. Poland\nrejects the policy of appeasement and imposed territorial\nsettlements.\nFinally, there is the issue of sanctions. I should like to\ndraw your attention to the implementation of Article 50 of\nthe Charter. I think that Member States which suffer heavy\neconomic losses as a result of applying sanctions should be\nentitled to something more than mere consultations and a\ngeneral - hence ineffective - appeal to the international\ncommunity to take account of their burden. As sanctions\nhave now become more frequent, the resulting problem of\neconomic losses by third countries cannot be ignored, as, in\nfact, it now is. A satisfactory mechanism should be worked\nout as a matter of urgency to resolve this issue.\nIn conclusion, the United Nations, like the world around\nit, is experiencing a dynamic period of transition influenced\nby fundamental reassessments and re-evaluations of the\npotential for peace, development and cooperation among\nnations.\nThe Organization is gearing itself to contribute its share\ntowards forging a better future for the world and improving\nthe human condition. It has every opportunity to establish\na comprehensive agenda within the trinity of peace and\nsecurity, sustainable human development, and democracy\nand human rights. It can thereby fulfil the Charter promise\n\\\"to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the\nattainment of these common ends\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "\nI am most pleased to\nconvey to Ambassador Insanally my congratulations and\nthose of my delegation on his election as President of\nGeneral Assembly at this session. At the same time, I wish\nto express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria for guiding with skill and dedication the work of\nthe Assembly at its previous session.\nLet me pay a tribute to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the vision and the energy he\nhas devoted to the leadership of our Organization at a\ndifficult but exhilarating moment in history.\nAllow me to express at this point the deep sympathies\nof my delegation for the people of India in connection with\nthe tragedy visited upon them by the earthquake that\ndevastated parts of the state of Maharashtra.\nThe President is presiding over the work of the\nAssembly in a world that continues its amazing political\ntransformation. Since we met in this same Hall last year, a\nperiod that is but the twinkling of an eye in the long history\nof mankind, the world\u2019s political landscape has been further\nand radically transformed. That transformation is, above all,\nreflected in and exemplified by two of the major\npreoccupations that have exercised the Assembly and the\ninternational community for decades - namely, the situation\nin South Africa and the problem of Palestine.\nThe abhorrent system of apartheid, long the evil\nfoundation of the South African State, has finally crumbled\nbecause of the unremitting efforts of the people of South\nAfrica and of the international community, not least of the\nUnited Nations. In its place, multiracial negotiations - in\nthemselves an amazing phenomenon in that country - have\nled to a specific programme with a precise timetable for the\nconversion of South Africa, in the words recently uttered in\nthis Hall by that authentic leader of the South African\npeople, Nelson Mandela, \\\"into a united, democratic,\nnon-racial and non-sexist country\\\".\nThe whole situation in the Middle East, too, has been\ntransformed, a transformation symbolized by a single\nhandshake in Washington. That historic gesture resulted\nfrom complex combinations of circumstances and\ndevelopments and presages further arduous negotiations and\ndetermined efforts by the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\ntheir neighbours. But there is now, more than ever before,\nreason to trust that in that long-afflicted part of the world the\npolitics of intolerance, hatred and despair is being replaced\nby the politics of accommodation, enlightenment,\npragmatism and hope.\nThus, the international community\u2019s political agenda,\nand the substance and content, if not the item-titles, of the\nAssembly\u2019s agenda, have radically changed.\nThe global economy is being transformed no less\nradically. Everywhere, obsolete obstacles to trade are\ncoming down, if not yet globally, then within the various\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 13\nregions of the world. To be sure, economic barriers\ncontinue to be propped up by atavistic hands that seek to\nreverse the tide and hold back the march of global economic\nprogress. The most obvious victim of these rearguard\nactions is the Uruguay Round, which, after years of\nfrustrating negotiations and painstaking bargaining, has yet\nto come to a conclusion. The ultimate victims are the global\neconomy and the livelihoods and standards of living of the\nworld\u2019s peoples. Here, the accusing finger of history points\nat certain developed countries, with their short-sighted\nsubsidies and protectionist devices. Nevertheless, the trend\ntowards trade and economic liberalization gathers\nmomentum. More and more nations recognize that that\ntrend can be reversed only at the peril of the well-being of\nthe world\u2019s peoples.\nOur region of South-East Asia has been a vital part of\nthe global political and economic transformation.\nThe conflict in Cambodia and the agony of the\nCambodian people long preoccupied this Assembly as well\nas the Security Council. Going beyond the expectations of\nso many, the Cambodian people have made their historic\ndecision for peace and reconciliation. We now call upon the\ninternational community to extend its support to the\nCambodian people and their new Government so that they\nwill find surcease not only from war, but also from poverty\nand want, and so that they will find not only peace, but a\nlife of dignity and freedom.\nThe Declaration by the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) on the South China Sea, which was issued\nin Manila last year, has received the strong endorsement of\nthe United Nations and of individual Governments, and we\nin South-East Asia have continued our measured effort to\nbuild a regime of peace, cooperation and mutual confidence\nin that disputed area.\nEarlier this year we in ASEAN, joined by the other\nnations of East Asia, including Viet Nam and Laos, and by\nothers with interests in the region, agreed upon an ASEAN\nRegional Forum in which questions of regional security can\nbe periodically examined and discussed together.\nIn East Asia, the rapid advance of economic\nliberalization has propelled the economies of the region to\nachieve some of the highest growth rates in the world. The\ncommitment to the free market has found its most forceful\nexpression in the decision of ASEAN\u2019s leaders to establish\nan ASEAN Free Trade Area through the steady reduction\nand eventual elimination of trade barriers within ASEAN.\nHappily, the dawning of a new era of peace and the\npromise of prosperity in our region have found a bright\nreflection in my country. President Ramos\u2019 policy of\nnational unity and reconciliation has replaced the politics of\ndivision. Dissident elements have been drawn back into the\nfold of society. Peace talks with the remaining disaffected\ngroups are being held. Amnesty has been offered to all.\nThe economics of selfishness and greed is being\nreplaced with reforms to secure economic fairness and social\njustice. The Philippine economy is ruled no longer by the\ntyranny of excessive regulation or of corporate monopoly but\nby the invigorating regime of market forces and free\ncompetition.Global competitiveness, in place of political\ncontention, is now the watchword throughout the land.\nAll this is being carried out with the most meticulous\nrespect for human rights in accordance with the national\nconsensus and the deepest convictions of our people. It is\nbeing achieved within the framework of our democratic\ninstitutions. For we are convinced that there is no substitute\nfor respect for human rights and democracy in the\nachievement of long-term stability and progress, as well as\nin the assurance of human dignity and the fulfilment of\nhuman aspirations.\nThe new situation in the world gives us new hope and\na brighter promise. But grave dangers and tragic situations\nremain. Old scourges continue to torment the human family;\nnew agonies confront it.\nReligious intolerance and the rise of nationalist\nambitions have supplanted ideological fanaticism as the fuel\nfor the fires of conflict that now burn in too many places in\nthe world. The collapse of empires has let loose the savage\nimpulse to settle historical scores, redress ancient ethnic\ngrievances, and set right real or imagined injustices over\nnational borders, the treatment of minorities, or the control\nof resources.\nThe tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the\nworst and most dangerous of these barbarities.\nDespite - in certain cases, because of - the onset of a\nclimate of peace, trafficking in the weapons of war\nsometimes continues unabated, dissipating resources,\nendangering people, imperilling the peace. The Philippines\nsteadfastly supports measures to promote greater\ntransparency in arms transfers and military expenditures,\nincluding the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe Philippines urges the nuclear-weapon States, in the\nstrongest terms, to restore the recently broken moratorium on\nall nuclear testing, and hopes that the international\ncommunity will decide, through a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty, to cease for ever the testing of nuclear devices, which\nso gravely threaten the very existence of the human family.\nThe Philippines favours the extension of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and calls upon all to\nabide strictly by its provisions, including the safeguards\nagreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nAt the same time, we urge the nuclear-weapon States to\nfulfil their own obligations under the Treaty and further\nreduce their stocks of such weapons until they are no more.\nAmid the rising tide of economic liberalization, the\nsiren song of protectionism continues to entice nations with\nits fraudulent promise. Legitimate concerns over health,\nfood safety, the environment, workers\u2019 welfare, and even\nhuman rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples -\nand now \\\"social dumping\\\" - are being invoked to clothe in\nvarious guises policies of naked protectionism.\nDecisions on global finance continue to be made by a\nfew, with the rest of the world standing by even though it is\nvitally affected. The burden of foreign debt continues to be\na millstone round the necks of many developing countries,\nand the problem is often aggravated by decisions on interest\nrates and exchange rates in which those countries have no\nvoice.\nThe Philippines continues faithfully to fulfil its external\nfinancial obligations, regardless of the extent to which that\npolicy holds back our economic growth, constitutes a burden\non our people, and imposes a heavy domestic political cost\non our leaders. But we wonder whether the world has tried\nhard enough to devise creative solutions to this economic\nplague upon the developing countries. After all, some\nnations have been favoured with decisive - even radical -\nmeasures to alleviate their foreign debt, such measures\nhaving become politically useful to the creditor countries.\nThe ravages that the profligacy of man has wrought\nupon the Earth\u2019s delicate environment continue to endanger\nour fragile planet and many nations. The Philippines has\nkept faith with the commitments made by us all at the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment because of its conviction that development\ncannot be sustained if the world\u2019s - and the\ncountry\u2019s - natural riches and the balance between them are\ndestroyed.\nNo less destructive is the accelerating increase in the\nillicit trafficking in drugs, which destroys the lives of our\npeople in the vigour of their youth. It gives rise to\nlawlessness and crime. It knows no national boundaries.\nWe therefore appeal for the full and effective\nimplementation of the United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme and the Global Programme of Action.\nIn situations of conflict, women, as well as children,\nbecome the most tragic victims by virtue of their inherent\nvulnerability. The systematic rape and murder of women\nand girls in Bosnia and Herzegovina is only the most\noutrageous instance of this abhorrent reality.\nSimilarly, in situations of extreme poverty, women -\nparticularly migrant workers - are the most vulnerable to\nabuse. Detached from the family, away from their\nhomeland, often living in their employer\u2019s home, unprotected\nby the country where they work, women migrant workers are\nespecially susceptible to maltreatment. The abuses to which\nthey are exposed, and often subjected, are a veritable litany\nof woe - denial of their rightful wages, excessive deductions\nby their employment agencies, intolerably long working\nhours, insufficient food, lack of medical care, the absence of\nany avenue for the redress of their grievances, physical\nattack, rape and other forms of sexual abuse.\nWe call upon the Assembly to keep among the areas of\nits concern the condition of women, who make up half of\nthe world - in particular, the migrant workers among them.\nAnd we call upon the Governments concerned to enact laws\nand other measures for the protection of these migrant\nworkers. We ask these Governments to cease the callous\ntreatment of migrant workers as commodities that are subject\nonly to the law of supply and demand.\nThese scourges of mankind - mass poverty, external\ndebt, environmental damage, illicit drugs, abuses against\nwomen, the mistreatment of migrant workers - would be\nmore effectively addressed if Governments, societies and the\ninternational community were to place people at the centre\nof development and international cooperation. This is what\nthe World Summit for Social Development is intended to do.\nWe urge the world\u2019s leaders and their Governments to\nensure maximum participation in this milestone event in\nCopenhagen in 1995.\nThe world has changed radically, largely for the better.\nBut old problems remain, and new challenges confront us.\nTo respond to these problems under the new circumstances,\nand to deal with these new challenges, our Organization, the\nUnited Nations, must renew itself.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 15\nIn few aspects of the work of the United Nations is this\nneed for renewal more evident than in the Security Council.\nThe structure of the Security Council was formulated at the\nvery birth of the United Nations, at the end of the Second\nWorld War and the beginning of the cold war. Forty-eight\nyears have passed. Massive changes have occurred in the\nworld, particularly in recent years. Empires have crumbled.\nThe ideological division of the world has melted away. The\ncold war has ended. The membership of the United Nations\nhas multiplied from 51 at the time of its founding to 184\ntoday.\nAnd yet, apart from the enlargement of its membership\n30 years ago from 9 nine to 15, the Security Council has not\nchanged. It has remained small, unrepresentative,\nundemocratic, opaque. We recognize the reality of\ncontinuing imbalances in world power and the necessity for\nthe Security Council to reflect this reality. But, surely, we\nmust also recognize the reality of the worldwide trend\ntowards, and the people\u2019s desire for, democratization and\ntransparency in political affairs. Surely, the Security\nCouncil, the United Nations body with the greatest impact\non international peace and security, must also reflect this\nreality in its size, in its structure, in its procedures, in its\nrelations with other United Nations bodies, including the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe are, therefore, in favour of a searching reassessment\nof the structure, role and procedures of the Security Council\nwith a view to its reform. And we urge that, in view of the\nrepercussions that such a reform would have on other United\nNations bodies and activities, this reassessment be carried\nout within the context of a thorough review of the Charter.\nThe sober, rational and\nrealistic proposals propounded yesterday by the Foreign\nMinister of Singapore might serve as a useful starting-point\nfor our consideration of this important matter.\nThe entire United Nations is, in fact, in need of reform.\nIn the new international situation, the enlarged demands\nupon the United Nations and the constraints on the available\nmeans require that the resources of the United Nations be\ncarefully husbanded for their most efficient use. The\nconcept and substance of management - and by that I mean\nthe science of management - must be imposed upon the\nUnited Nations bureaucracy. Funds and other assets must be\nmost meticulously safeguarded and effectively utilized.\nDuplication must be avoided, costs drastically cut, waste\nradically reduced, and corruption abolished.\nI am sure that many developing countries share our\ndesire that the United Nations should impose upon itself the\nausterity and discipline that are required of many of us by\nthe international financial institutions.\nWe pay a tribute to the Secretary-General\u2019s attention to\nthis aspect of his work. We welcome in particular the\ncreation of the new post of Assistant Secretary-General for\nInspections and Investigations as an indication of his\ndetermination to address this problem.\nThe Philippines is up to date in its contribution to the\nfinances of the United Nations. It may be a small amount\nin the totality of the Organization\u2019s resources, but it is\nsubstantial in proportion to our financial capacity. We\nwould not want to see it squandered. We cannot afford it.\nNeither can the United Nations.\nMay I propose, then, that a group of men and women\nwith both extensive experience and skill in corporate\nmanagement and extensive exposure to the special\nrequirements and problems of the United Nations be\ncommissioned to study this question in greater depth and\ndetail and with greater objectivity, and to make the\nappropriate recommendations. There are many in this Hall\nright now who would be eminently qualified to perform this\ntask. The Philippines will explore the possibility of a draft\nresolution to this effect at a suitable time.\nThis is a matter of great and urgent necessity. For\nreforms in the United Nations will place the Organization in\na better position to deal with the demands upon it in the\nsecond half-century of its existence and to fulfil in the next\nmillennium the vision that its founding fathers had for this\ngreat and indispensable Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, Sir, to offer you my warmest\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election to the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. Your presence at the head\nof this Assembly clearly attests to the commitment of your\ncountry - Guyana - to the defence of peace and the\npromotion of multilateral diplomacy. Your skills and your\nexperience on the international scene, acquired over many\nyears, will, we are certain, ensure the successful conclusion\nof our deliberations. My country, Guinea-Bissau, wishes to\nassure you of our fullest readiness to cooperate with you.\nOur congratulations and thanks go to your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the remarkable and\nconstructive job he did in steering the work of the forty-\nseventh session. We wish also to express our gratitude to\nHis Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, for the way in which he is\ndirecting the work of the Organization in this new context.\nWe hail the advent of new Members to the great family\nof the United Nations: Andorra, Monaco, Eritrea, the Czech\nRepublic, Slovakia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia.\nI am particularly honoured to have the privilege of\nspeaking on behalf of my country, Guinea-Bissau, at the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly at a time when\nan increased worldwide consensus seems to be emerging, in\nthat significant and encouraging changes are taking place in\nthe global political and economic landscape.\nHow many questions, expectations and, indeed, how\nmuch skepticism underlie that assertion?\nThe end of the bipolar domination of international\nrelations and the cessation of the cold war, which affected\nall continents, constitute an event that is of manifest political\nsignificance and of great historical impact - first, because it\nhas led to the dismantling of an international order that\nprevailed for half a century and divided the world into\nhostile blocs; secondly, because it has cleared a space for the\ndevelopment of certain processes whose free evolution was\nimpeded because of the political discipline imposed, within\neach bloc, by the demands of the conflicts between the two\nsuper-Powers.\nThe world power pattern has changed. This has led to\na shift in certain countries\u2019 relative positions in the economic\nand political hierarchy. The very nature of the relations\nbetween these countries is changing. However, the rules and\npractices that will constitute the basis of the new\ninternational order have not yet been defined.\nAs happens in periods of history marked by great\nchanges - especially unpredictable changes - we are now\nwitnessing the emergence of factors that give rise to both\nintegration and disintegration, to the order and disorder that\n\nare alternating in international behaviour and in the conduct\nof international affairs. The new and old orders are fighting\nfor primacy in the development of an international system,\nand it is no longer easy to distinguish between the past and\nthe future.\nThe new international context gives rise to considerable\nanxiety, especially as it poses several questions that have not\nyet been answered. For example, it is not clear how\npolitical hegemony can be exercised in a system that has\nbecome multipolar; strong tendencies towards globalization\nand towards regionalization are emerging on the international\nscene, and one wonders how these can be reconciled; the\nnation State\u2019s decision-making capacity is limited by\ntransnational players, and its prerogatives of sovereignty are\nbeing ceded in order that it may be incorporated into broader\npolitical and economic entities, even as ancient ethnic groups\nare claiming the right to be regarded as nation States; one\nsees increasing capitalist competition in a situation in which\neconomic interdependence imposes new parameters for the\nsettlement of conflicts of interest; one is witnessing a world-\nwide heightening of awareness of the responsibility of us all\nwith regard to ecological matters, and, at the same time, one\nhas to deal with the means of sharing responsibility between\nthe various countries.\nThis is hardly an exhaustive list, but it is sufficient to\ndemonstrate the extent to which the international agenda is\nbeing broadened and made more complicated. The future of\nmany countries will depend on the items on that agenda and\non our capacity to organize our approach to them.\nGiven this situation, it is absolutely vital that the closest\npossible contact between nations be maintained by means of\nthe exchange of information, joint thinking and discussion,\nso that awareness of the changes that are under way and of\ntheir possible impact on a continent such as Africa may be\ndeepened.\nAt the beginning of my statement, I mentioned the\nemergence of a universal consensus that has stemmed form\nthe changes in the international system. The wide prospects\nthat have opened up, in terms of the peaceful settlement of\nconflicts and the elimination of tension in regions such as\nsouthern Africa, western Africa, the Maghreb, Central\nEurope, Eastern Europe and Asia, lead us to believe that this\nprocess, which is marked by the strong resolve of the\ninternational community to achieve lasting peace, will not\nturn out to be a short-term symptom of a world in upheaval.\nThe situation prevailing in Angola is still a matter of\nmajor concern to Guinea-Bissau. My Government welcomes\nthe unanimous adoption, by the Security Council of the\nUnited Nations, of resolution 864 (1993), which is a logical\nfollow-up to earlier resolutions that aim at the restoration of\npeace to Angola. We are convinced that only dialogue can\nlead to a lasting solution that will result in the return of\npeace to that country. The parties to the conflict should\ncomply in full with the obligations resulting from the\nagreements that have been signed and from the Security\nCouncil resolutions. This is the only possible way to end\nthe suffering of the Angolan people and to respond to their\nlegitimate desire for peace and democracy.\nWith regard to Mozambique, we should like to express\nour concern at the slowness with which the Peace\nAgreement is being implemented. We encourage the parties\nconcerned to continue their efforts to strengthen peace and\nnational unity. Further, we exhort the international\ncommunity to continue its support for that process.\nIn South Africa, the abolition of the legislative pillars\nof apartheid is a positive step. It is now important that the\nlast obstacles, including those caused by the climate of\nviolence, be removed to make possible negotiations towards\nthe creation of a non-racial and democratic South Africa.\nWe have welcomed with satisfaction President Nelson Mandela\u2019s appeal concerning the lifting of\nsanctions against South Africa.\nThe tragedy that, daily, besets the Somali people gives\nus reason for great anxiety. We urge all the parties\nconcerned to end the hostilities and to commit themselves to\nnegotiation. We are convinced that the peace-keeping\nactivities in Somalia, within the framework of the United\nNations Operation in Somalia (UNISOM II), should, above\nall, serve the interests of the Somali people and strengthen\nthe fragile process of national reconciliation that is under\nway.\nWe happily welcome the positive developments in\nLiberia - in particular, the signing, at Cotonou, of the Peace\nAgreement, including the provision for the establishment of\na central transitional Government. However, we regret the\nwidespread adverse effects the Liberian war has had on the\nterritory of neighbouring countries. We express the hope\nthat all the protagonists on the Liberian political scene will\npersevere in the consolidation of peace by making every\neffort towards reconstruction of their country.\nIn the Maghreb, the constructive position taken by the\nKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front makes it\npossible to be optimistic about developments in the situation\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 3\nin Western Sahara and about the prospects for organizing a\nreferendum under United Nations auspices.\nGuinea-Bissau watches with concern the conflict that is\nlaying waste the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We\nbelieve that only an agreement acceptable to all parties\ninvolved in the conflict will put an end to this bloody\nepisode. My Government regrets that the latest Geneva talks\non peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina did not yield the\nexpected results. We hope that the parties will adopt more\nflexible positions with a view to bringing about the signing\nof a peace agreement.\nGuinea-Bissau believes that the solution to this\nfratricidal conflict must be sought by peaceful means. That\nis why we continue to support the United Nations and the\nEuropean Community\u2019s negotiating effort and welcome the\nSecurity Council\u2019s adoption of resolution 827 (1993) on the\nestablishment of an International Tribunal.\nIn the case of East Timor, we urge the Secretary-\nGeneral to continue his efforts with the parties concerned\naimed at finding a peaceful, negotiated solution to this issue.\nIn the Middle East, peace is now possible thanks to the\nrapprochement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. We greet the Washington agreement with\nsatisfaction and renewed hope. We encourage the parties to\ncontinue negotiations with a view to establishing a lasting\npeace throughout the region.\nThe reunification of China is in essence the sole\nconcern of the Chinese people. In our opinion, the\ninternational community should turn its attention to the need\nto recognize the fundamental rights of the 21 million\ninhabitants of the Republic of China.\nThe poverty and social injustice that are the sorry lot of\na large portion of humankind are amongst the underlying\ncauses of the conflicts that constantly threaten the world\u2019s\npeace and stability. The ideological tensions of the cold war\nseem likely to be replaced by new tensions, this time\neconomic in origin, if adequate precautions are not taken.\nThe United Nations must of course strengthen its structure\nfor maintaining world peace and security, but it must also\nplay a leading role in helping to build a stable economic\nsystem and promoting the development of the developing\ncountries, particularly that of the least developed countries.\nThis is without question the best and most effective form of\npreventive diplomacy.\nThe economic situation in Africa is becoming more and\nmore worrying. Today, on the eve of the twenty-first\ncentury, incomes in sub-Saharan Africa average $490 per\nperson per year, in other words, they are the lowest in the\nworld. The average figure masks great disparities between\ncountries: Africa is the only region in the world where the\nnumber of people living in poverty is likely to increase\nmarkedly before the year 2000. Trends in the world\neconomy lead us to predict that the situation will get worse.\nBlack Africa\u2019s share of world trade has plummeted\nfrom 3.8 per cent in 1970 to 1 per cent now, which has\nentailed Africa\u2019s being relegated to the sidelines in\ninternational relations. Despite plentiful labour and\ninvestment opportunities, direct investment from the most\nindustrialized countries is in flight from the least developed\ncountries towards the advanced economies. Sub-Saharan\nAfrica receives about 6 per cent of direct investment, which\nis profitable essentially for those few countries with oil\nand/or strategically important minerals.\nRestrictions on international trade as a result of various\nprotectionist practices and of subsidy policies for the\nindustrialized countries\u2019 agricultural products are imposing\nsevere limitations on the underdeveloped countries\u2019 export\nopportunities. In this regard, can we hope that the Uruguay\nRound negotiations, if they succeed, will spare humankind\nthe possible unpleasant aftermath of discriminatory practices\non the part of the trading blocs?\nWe wish to make an appeal that the next round of\nnegotiations be planned to have all the relevance that the\nsituation requires. In the meanwhile, it is painful for us to\nsee how those who recommend to us that we should\nliberalize trade if we want to get our economies moving\nagain can, in the blink of an eye, become fervent defenders\nof protectionism when they are convinced that they are\ndefending their own interests that way. Liberal policies in\nthe countries of the South have not a hope of succeeding\nunless the countries of the North systematically dismantle\ntheir protectionist barriers and open up their markets.\nThe transition to effective and lasting market economies\nrequires further buttressing from the international\ncommunity. Most of the underdeveloped countries,\nparticularly in Africa, have recognized the errors that were\ncommitted in their post-colonial economic management.\nThey have therefore embarked, with the assistance of the\ninternational financial organizations and other partners\nabroad, on radical economic reforms aimed at laying the\nfoundations for economic growth and development.\nEnormous political and social costs have had to be borne in\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncarrying out these reforms, but the will to succeed is still\nthere despite all the odds against it.\nUnfortunately, these efforts have been overwhelmed by\nthe massive reductions in financial assistance from the\nindustrialized countries and the multilateral organizations.\nThe target set by the United Nations for official development\nassistance (ODA), 0.7 per cent of gross national product\n(GNP), has scarcely been complied with at all. At the\nmoment, only an infinitesimal fraction of ODA is being\nallocated to the poorest countries and even less than that to\nthe priority sectors that are most likely to trigger\ndevelopment. ODA must be restructured if the problem of\npoverty and lasting development is to be tackled. We must\ntake the risk and have faith in a renewed Africa with a new\neconomic management mind-set.\nJudging by the number of international conferences and\nmeetings on Africa that are held each year and the feeble\nway they make available finance to root out the evils they\ndeplore so much, we could be right in saying that we live in\na real consumer society for intellectual products, that is.\nPeople are at last beginning to wake up to the fact that these\ninternational meetings, although they sometimes do succeed\nin making world public opinion aware of one or another\naspect of underdevelopment, have not contributed very much\nat all towards eliminating the great scourge of\nunderdevelopment itself.\nNot only does the way economic and financial\nopportunities are being distributed throughout the world\nprovide the less developed countries with piffling amounts\nof resources, even worse than that is the way colossal\namounts are being clawed back from them, particularly\nthrough those notorious debt-servicing costs. Total debt as\na percentage of GNP stands at over 100 per cent, and debt-\nservicing costs are over 20 per cent and even 50 per cent in\nsome cases. As a result, several African countries are\nunable to maintain the infrastructures for production or the\nsocial services that are vital to development.\nTraditional approaches to solving the debt problem,\nwhile they have granted some countries a few months\u2019\nbreathing space, would none the less appear to have\nexacerbated the problem, since Africa\u2019s debt burden has\ngone on growing, by about 10 per cent over the last decade.\nThis is extremely worrying.\nHow can we allot more financial resources to\ndeveloping our human resources, involving women in\ndevelopment and protecting the environment if at the same\ntime the donors are mounting pressures to have the debt paid\nback, operate unfavourable trade policies and cut back their\nassistance? My country believes that major steps absolutely\nmust be taken if we want the low-income countries not to\nmiss the boat for economic modernization and development.\nThe Trinidad conclusions, which propose canceling two\nthirds of the eligible debt coupled with a rescheduling of the\nremainder over 25 years and an additional five-year grace\nperiod, offer a promising and encouraging approach to\neasing the debt burden. However, the Trinidad conclusions\nshould also be applied to multilateral debt, which now\naccounts for one third of debt servicing costs.\nIf our planet is to have lasting security, there must be\na collective effort to combat the endogenous and exogenous\nfactors that nowadays condemn the majority of the world\u2019s\npopulation to absolute poverty. If this poverty persists, its\nconsequences will ultimately spill over borders in the form\nof migration, terrorism, drugs and crime of all kinds.\nAfrica\u2019s economy is worsening to such an extent that\nwe must break with routine thinking and devise new\ninstruments and methods in order to understand and properly\nrespond to the needs of a continent which is economically in\nanguish. Unfortunately, it is clear that technological\nadvances, which should contribute to improving the human\nlot everywhere, are actually creating an increasingly greater\ngulf between those who have mastered that technology and\nthose who are trying to enter into the technological age. The\ndevelopment of science and technology ill-suited to our\nneeds is contributing to a reduction in the demand for\ncommodities and is consequently further worsening the terms\nof trade.\nGiven all these issues, does this Organization not have\na role to play in mitigating the negative effects on the least-\ndeveloped countries of the rapid globalization of production\nand sophisticated technological systems? This is the very\nfoundation of the preventive diplomacy that the United\nNations has advocated.\nThe prospects for development are also threatened by\nthe staggering pace of the degradation of the environment.\nThe degradation of natural resources and ecosystems poses\na major threat to humankind.\nFor Africa, which still depends on natural resources for\nits survival, this situation involves grave consequences likely\nto hamper medium-term economic recovery programmes if\nurgent measures are not taken and the appropriate means\nmobilized. With national budgets already truncated, African\ncountries will find it very difficult to face these challenges\nunaided in the absence of an increase in international\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 5\nassistance, properly programmed and managed so as to\nensure the rational development and regulation of the\nenvironment.\nThe economic difficulties faced by most of the\ncountries of the South have markedly diminished their ability\nto act together and in a coordinated manner. Domestic\neconomic challenges, instead of promoting the mobilization\nof forces and resources in a regional or subregional context,\noften lead to a tendency by these countries to turn inward.\nThis tendency has been compounded by structural adjustment\nprogrammes designed and executed in a strictly national\ncontext, with the aim of upgrading short-term indicators of\nmacroeconomic and financial performance. The chances for\nsustainable development in the developing countries and\nparticularly in the least-developed countries could be\nincreased by strengthened programmes of regional and\nsubregional integration and cooperation.\nIn this respect, we welcome the efforts of the European\nEconomic Community, in the framework of the Lom\u00e9 IV\nConvention, to lay the foundation for closer economic\ncooperation between the five Portuguese-speaking countries\nof Africa, despite the fact that they are not geographically\ncontiguous. In this context, strengthening the ties of\nfriendship and cooperation with Portugal and Brazil will\nmake it possible to develop a special kind of relationship\nbetween these countries, all of which use the Portuguese\nlanguage.\nIt has now been clearly acknowledged that the active\nparticipation of peoples in political, economic and social life\nis an essential prerequisite for releasing creative energy and\nenriching cultural values and people\u2019s ability to take control\nof its own destiny. Mindful of this fact, Guinea-Bissau, like\nother countries of our continent, has opted for democracy as\none of the means to mobilize its full human and physical\npotential in the struggle against underdevelopment. In this\nrespect, the appropriate legal and institutional machinery has\nbeen established, with a view to promoting a political system\nbased on consensus and the rule of the majority and on a\ntransparent and effective public administration.\nThe democratic process, to be credible, must mesh with\nthe socio-cultural heritage of a region or a country.\nVirtually everywhere in Africa, we are witnessing the\nemergence of new forces for change which are in the\nvanguard of democracy: civilian societies, especially free-\nassociation and cooperative movements; non-governmental\norganizations; and civic associations.\nDespite some short-term obstacles, political pluralism\nin Guinea-Bissau is, without the shadow of a doubt, an\nirreversible process. One of its stages will culminate in the\nholding of the first multi-party elections, scheduled for 27\nMarch 1994. To ensure the greatest possible transparency in\nthese elections, the Government is taking all the steps\nnecessary to prepare for them, with the support of its foreign\npartners. In this context, international observers will be\ninvited to assist in the organization of the elections, and we\nlook forward to receiving increased support from the\ninternational community at the appropriate time.\nSustained support for these new forces of change is\nabsolutely vital if we wish to bolster new democracies and\nexplicitly affirm our commitment to the protection of human\nrights.\nThe challenges facing the United Nations in terms of\nmaintaining international peace and stability while at the\nsame time promoting economic and social development in a\nrapidly changing world require that profound changes be\nmade in its structure. These changes should take into\naccount the interests of all the components. More than ever,\ninternational cooperation has become an opportunity to\ncreate lasting peace, to strengthen protection for the dignity\nof human beings everywhere, and to safeguard the rights,\nprofound aspirations and well-being of present and future\ngenerations.\nFor its part, Guinea-Bissau, faithful to the principles\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and determined to\nmake its contribution to the maintenance of international\npeace and security, solemnly reaffirms its firm commitment\nto pursue this course. We are convinced that the task of\nmaintaining international peace and security is a\nresponsibility incumbent on the whole of the international\ncommunity, on all countries large and small, in conformity\nwith the principle of the sovereign equality of States.\nIt is against this backdrop that my country has\npresented its candidacy as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council, and we ask all Member States to support\nus.\nGuinea-Bissau is admittedly a small country, but its\nfirm resolve to contribute to the attainment of the objectives\nof this Organization is widely known. Our presence at this\ntime - in the framework of United Nations Missions - in\nAngola, Mozambique, Liberia, Cambodia, Haiti and in the\nformer Yugoslavia, in both the civilian and the military\nspheres, is a clear illustration of this assertion.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n"

        "file_text": "I would first of all like to\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to this\nresponsible post, and to wish you success.\nOn behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria, let me\ncongratulate the delegations of the States that have joined the\nUnited Nations as new Members this year - the Czech\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra.\nThree years ago, in this same Hall, I had the honour of\naddressing the world forum. My message was on behalf of\ndemocratic Bulgaria, a country where changes fully and\ngenuinely match the ideals and values uniting the nations in\nthe world Organization. Since then, as indeed over the past\nyear, under the Bulgarian presidency of the General\nAssembly, we have witnessed diverse and often contradicting\ntrends in international life. If there is a dominating feeling,\nthough, it is one of optimism and of trust, on the part of\nboth Governments and nations, in the United Nations as a\nspokesman for and guarantor of the political will of the\nworld community for peace and sustainable democratic\ndevelopment. We have seen a number of encouraging\nexamples of this.\nThe democratic changes in Eastern Europe have added\nan element of dynamism to building European unity and the\nEuropean civil society, a society open to the rest of the\nworld. Important forums of the European Community, the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the\nCouncil of Europe provide a frame and a foundation for the\nemerging European unity and security. Bulgaria has been an\nactive participant in the European organizations. It will be\nthe first post-Communist country to assume the presidency\nof the Committee of Ministers of the oldest European\norganization - the Council of Europe. It is also a\ncoordinator of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Group,\nbringing together the countries of that region.\nAfter the Berlin wall, the walls of Jericho came\ntumbling down. There began the long-expected unraveling\nof the Gordian knot in the Middle East, the place where\nthree world cultural and religious traditions coexist. We\nwelcome also the development of democratic processes in\nSouth Africa that will lead to the establishment of a united\nand non-racial society.\nHumanity has bid farewell to chemical weapons; and it\nhas succeeded in convening world conferences on subjects\nbelieved until recently to defy consensus, such as human\nrights and protection for the victims of war.\nThe democratic changes in Eastern Europe and the\nformer Soviet Union continue to be an important condition\nfor the positive changes in international life at the turn of\nthis century. The heightened attention of the world\ncommunity to the social and political tensions in Moscow is\nas understandable as is the broad international support for\nthe reform-minded and democratic forces in Russia, support\nwith which Bulgaria fully agrees. The dramatic events in\nMoscow which we witnessed over the weekend prove how\ndifficult and painful the transition from post-Communist\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsociety to democracy and a market economy is, and what\ndangers and risks it entails. The United Nations cannot\nsimply stand by and watch with indifference the difficulties\nof the countries in transition. If we are to live up to the\nname \\\"United Nations\\\" we have to render our moral,\npolitical and financial support to these nations.\nThe collapse of totalitarian rule, and the breakup of the\nSoviet empire and of the Warsaw Treaty, created an\nunexpected paradox: less danger to world peace and, at the\nsame time, less peace in the world and more challenges and\ntrials for the United Nations.\nRegional conflicts have proved to be a key problem for\nthe new democracies. Think of the consequences of the\nworld community\u2019s failure to handle the war in the former\nYugoslavia! The stakes are always high but they are even\nhigher in the Balkans where conflicts threaten to spill over\nand embroil other States.\nBulgaria\u2019s civilized and good-neighbourly Balkan policy\nentitles it now, as indeed at the very outset of the Yugoslav\ncrisis, to insist on firm judgement and energetic steps on the\npart of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General to contain and end the barbaric war in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and to prevent other smouldering\nconflicts in former Yugoslavia from flaring up.\nRecent attempts to find concerted ways of coordinating\nthe peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have been\nfollowed with keen interest in Bulgaria. We have already\nvoiced our support for the constructive engagement of\nPresident Clinton\u2019s Administration, notably the preventive\nstationing of a contingent of troops under a United Nations\nflag in Macedonia.\nBulgaria is against re-drawing borders and gaining\nterritory by force. It has been consistent in its position in\nfavour of a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis.\nBy virtue of its geopolitical situation, Bulgaria has a\nkey role to play in implementing the economic sanctions\nagainst Serbia and Montenegro. We share the longest land\nborder with Serbia and we are not involved, either directly\nor indirectly, in the hostilities in former Yugoslavia.\nWithout Bulgaria the sanctions will be doomed to failure.\nFully aware of our responsibility, we adhere strictly to the\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council in the face of\ngreat economic sacrifice. Measured against our potential,\nthe losses are indeed huge. The embargo has closed\nBulgaria\u2019s direct route to the markets of Western Europe.\nConsequently, its losses for 1992 were estimated - with\nexpert assistance from the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) - at $943.6 million. The 1993 figure is\nexpected to be several times higher. The effect of the\nsanctions may lead to halting and thwarting economic\nreform, as well as jeopardizing the democratic process and\nsocial peace in Bulgaria. In other words, the price Bulgaria\nis paying for peace and security in the Balkans and in\nEurope may prove fatal to its internal peace and stability.\nDirect losses from the sanctions against former Yugoslavia,\nIraq and Libya, are commensurate with one half of\nBulgaria\u2019s external debt to commercial creditor banks, and\nthey dim the prospects for economic recovery, development\nand integration into the world community.\nAs a State Member of the United Nations Bulgaria\nfulfils its international obligations in good faith, convinced\nthat any civilized country concerned about world security\nshould uphold a common cause - even at the cost of\nsacrifice. Yet, is it not fair for a country in our position to\nseek assistance and understanding from the world\nOrganization and its Member States?\nThere is an urgent need to devise a working mechanism\nof awarding compensation to Member States which sustain\nlosses as a result of the strict implementation of the\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council. The provisions\nof Chapter VII of the Charter are equally important and\nshould be applied strictly. Article 50 of the Charter could be\nbacked up by relevant agreements for concrete aid to\nMember States affected by sanctions against third countries.\nThe forms of compensation could include, among others,\nmeasures to ease the economic situation of the affected\ncountry, such as concluding stand-by agreements with the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), facilitating the debt-\nservicing and settlement procedure, financing major transport\nand communication infrastructure projects nationally and\nregionally - in our case, new bridges on the River Danube,\nan international airport, motorways linking Bulgaria and\nGreece, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania such as\nThessaloniki-Vidin and Sofia-Skopje-Tirana - speeding up\nthe ratification of the European Association Agreement\nbetween Bulgaria and the European Community and an\nearlier accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade.\nThe Bulgarian delegation at this session of the General\nAssembly will put forward proposals on some of the above\nissues. We rely on the support and cooperation of the States\nMembers of the Organization in this regard.\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 7\nConsidering that no international organization at the\nmoment is in a position to award direct compensation for\nlosses sustained as a result of economic sanctions, the\nindirect ways of compensation could be of crucial\nimportance.\nThe problem of international sanctions and\ncompensation merits serious attention. It calls for an\nin-depth analysis, as it vitally concerns a number of States\nMembers of the United Nations. The time is ripe to look\ninto these issues at a special forum for which Bulgaria offers\nits hospitality.\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations have\nconstituted a most significant and prominent part of the\nworld Organization\u2019s work over the past year. I could not\nemphasize more the importance of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which developed the\nconcept of crisis management through preventive diplomacy.\nBulgaria supported this political strategy and backed up its\nwords with actions by sending Blue Helmets to Cambodia.\nOnce again, the international community seems to have\nbeen inadequately prepared for mounting such operations.\nThe question of the safety of United Nations personnel\nproved particularly poignant. Bulgaria lost 10 volunteers in\nCambodia, not to mention the cost of its involvement, which\nhas not yet been fully estimated.\nEarly warning for potential conflicts calls for effective\ninternational mechanisms to monitor the human rights\nsituation, including that of individuals from minority groups\n- because conflicts brew wherever individual human rights\nare trampled upon, wherever the universal values of modern\ncivilization are replaced by survival instincts and political\npluralism and the diversity of ideas, by intolerance,\nxenophobia, racism, religious and political bigotry and\nviolence. The idea of creating a new post within the United\nNations system, that of a high commissioner for human\nrights, is an expression of the desire to step up international\ncooperation in this field. We are prepared to participate\nactively in discussing this matter.\nLet us look at the United Nations potential for crisis\nmanagement. Many of the proposed ideas hold out promise.\nBut if they are to materialize, the United Nations must live\nup to its coordinating, organizing and mobilizing role in\nfinding the relevant political and military means. In the\nYugoslav crisis, for instance, the Euro-Atlantic and European\nsecurity organizations could have taken up some of its\nfunctions.\nHere is a case in point. The North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) has undergone a significant evolution\nin its attitude towards the conflict. As well as becoming a\nmajor challenge, the Yugoslav crisis has provided an impetus\nfor the alliance to review its priorities and objectives.\nBulgaria openly declares its readiness to enhance its\ncooperation - including as a full member - with NATO and\nits member States. Our good bilateral relations and security\ncooperation with Turkey and Greece illustrate clearly our\napproach and intentions. It would be beneficial to Balkan\nand European security if these relations could be developed\nfurther into cooperation between allies within NATO.\nBulgaria is willing and able to shoulder responsibility and\nact as a reliable partner.\nAddressing today\u2019s global social and economic\nproblems calls for new approaches in the work of the United\nNations specialized bodies in these areas. New ways and\nmeans should be sought to facilitate access to technical\nassistance and modern technologies. There is a need for\ndaring and pragmatic initiatives in areas such as trade\nliberalization, the future of the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT), external debt, labour migration,\nunemployment, environmental safety and the proliferation of\nenvironmentally friendly technologies. The Republic of\nBulgaria is ready to cooperate in any of the above-mentioned\nefforts as a member of various United Nations bodies,\nincluding possibly the Economic and Social Council.\nThe strengthening of the regime of the Treaty on the\nnon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the preparation\nfor the review Conference in 1995 are of paramount\nimportance. Bulgaria shares the view that the non-\nproliferation Treaty should become universal and be of\nindefinite duration.\nBulgaria\u2019s expectations for the future role and functions\nof the United Nations determine its attitude towards the\nongoing reform of the world Organization. On the basis of\nits history of nearly 50 years, the Member States can identify\nelements of its Charter and structure that need revision and\nothers that are universal and lasting and whose validity\nshould not be questioned. Clearly, such decisions can be\nreached only after serious debate and by consensus of the\nMember States, notably the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. It is essential to preserve the Security\nCouncil as an effective decision-making mechanism if its\nrepresentation is broadened. The powers and responsibility\nof the Secretary-General will certainly change, with an\nincreasing emphasis on his diplomatic and peace-making\nefforts.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe Bulgarian delegation is taking part in the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly and making its\ncontribution as an active member of the international\ncommunity. Our commitment to the problems and the future\nof the Organization is prompted by our awareness of being\namong the staunchest supporters of its cause and noble\nmissions.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, may I\nfirst of all congratulate you on your election, and on the\ndignified and effective way in which you are already\npresiding over this Assembly. You have a burdensome job\nand we wish you all good fortune as you discharge it.\nI have sometimes heard speakers from this rostrum\npatrol the world in their speeches in the general debate,\ndealing at length with one continent after another. Indeed,\nI have done so myself in past years. There is much to\ndescribe: events in the Middle East and South Africa are\nparticularly encouraging, and developments in Russia, as we\nhave just heard from Mr. Kozirev, are particularly important.\nBut today it seems to me that in the time available, the focus\nof interest should not only be on distant events or distant\ntragedies, but here, in this building, on this institution.\nNever has there been a time when the United Nations has\nbeen so discussed, so misunderstood, so needed.\nThe international task of this decade is managing\ndisorder. I believe it is possible. But it demands cool\nheads, low voices, and an understanding of what we can and\ncannot do. It demands concertation between all countries\nthat take on part of the responsibility for steering the world\nthrough channels which are certainly strewn with rocks.\nThis concertation takes place in many forums, but nowhere\nwith greater legal and political authority than here at the\nUnited Nations.\nWe can now see the events of 1989 in their true\nperspective. They did not usher in a new world order. I\nthink we have to be sober about this. What happened in\n1989 was not the birth of a new world order, it was the\ncollapse of one super-Power and the end of communism as\na threat to world peace.\nThe tragedies of the world have continued. Indeed,\nthey have probably increased since 1989. \\\"Tragedy\\\" is a\nbetter description than the usual, and overworked, term\n\\\"crisis\\\", because \\\"crisis\\\" implies a threat to world peace.\nNow that the cold war is over and super-Powers no longer\nexert themselves on behalf of clients, it is no longer a crisis\nin that sense - a threat to world peace - if Sudan, Bosnia,\nAngola, Liberia, Georgia, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Somalia,\nTajikistan, Azerbaijan and others are racked by civil war.\nBut these are appalling tragedies for those who are killed or\ndriven from their homes, and indeed for all of us, because\nwe are all diminished when the bell tolls.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSome of these tragedies are illuminated by the\nhaphazard light of television. In those cases, millions of our\ncitizens, in all our countries, share feelings of sympathy,\nindignation and horror. But other tragedies equally foul are\nplayed in a darkened theatre: no television, no audience,\nlittle pressure. But all these tragedies are a reproach to those\nof us who are convinced that it is possible slowly and\npainstakingly to construct a more decent world.\nHow do we do that? Not, it is clear, by the remaining\nsuper-Power using its superiority to impose its own solutions\nby force. In the 10 tragedies that I listed, the United States\nhas intervened with troops only in one, Somalia - and that\nnow on a reduced scale and under the United Nations -\nbecause the United States, quite rightly in my view, is not\nprepared to send its troops all over the world, as Rome once\nsent its legions all over Europe, to fight, to pacify and to\nrule. There are British, French, Spanish and other European\ntroops in Bosnia today under the command of the United\nNations. But their role is to save Bosnian lives - they do\nthat daily - implementing United Nations decisions.\nLikewise, they are not imposing a European imperium on\nthat country.\nIf America and its allies are not to exert themselves as\na joint imperial Power, imposing on other countries and\nsustaining laws and rulers of their choice, then the answer\ncan only lie in reforming and making much better use of the\ninternational institutions to which we belong. They were\nmostly built after the Second World War for one purpose\nand are now, after the end of the cold war, being hurriedly\nadapted for another. The British architect Norman Foster\nhas just been given the responsibility of designing in Berlin\nthe new parliament house for a united Germany. If his plans\nare accepted, he intends to include the old Reichstag\nbuilding alongside the line of the Berlin Wall in a splendid\nnew structure reaching across the old Wall into East Berlin.\nThere is a parable here for us as well as for Germany.\nInevitably, we have to cope as best we can with what\nwe have. A man, after all, may take some shelter in an\nunfinished building. I do not believe that an international\norganization like ours, which is not a colonizing Power, will\never be able to guarantee solutions to civil wars or even to\nthat pernicious variant of a civil war which we see today in\nBosnia. But if there are no guarantees of success, the\nUnited Nations can be helped greatly to improve on its\nrecord. With greater experience, greater resources for\npreventive action and effectively coordinated humanitarian\nefforts, it can act before the situation gets out of control and\nthe demand grows for the implementation of sanctions and\nfor peace enforcement.\nI hope that within the next few weeks the European\nCommunity will move into a new phase of working together\non a common foreign and security policy once the Treaty of\nMaastricht is ratified by all 12 member States. Our\nPresident, Willy Claes, the Foreign Minister and Deputy\nPrime Minister of Belgium, has just illustrated that point.\nBut one of our main aims as European partners must be to\nsupport and strengthen the role and the work of the United\nNations, for the United Nations is not \\\"them\\\"; it is us, all of\nus. We have to take responsibility for it and its failures.\nIf we want the United Nations to work better, it is up\nto us to give the Secretary-General the support he needs in\nthoughts, words, deeds and money. I suppose there are few\nmore lonely or more demanding jobs than that of the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and the present\nSecretary-General certainly has the misfortune to hold his\noffice in interesting times. He has already given and\ncontinues to give a firm and effective lead. He needs and\ndeserves our support.\nThe United Nations is unique. It alone conveys the\nword of the international community. Only the United\nNations has the legal powers to translate those words into\naction for the maintenance of world peace. We need, as\nPresident Clinton said yesterday, to look at tasks closely, to\nensure that they are properly defined and that the resources\nare there to meet them. We may on occasion have to accept\nthat a mandate should not be given because in reality it\ncannot be fulfilled.\nLet me follow that by looking briefly at the way we\ncarry out peace-keeping operations, the way we deploy\npreventive diplomacy and the way we run our finances.\nPeace-keeping: United Nations blue-helmets are\ndeployed on nearly every continent. We can reel off the\nstatistics, but actually we hear too little of individual soldiers\nand small detachments. Who knows, for example, of the\nsingle military observer in a remote part of Cambodia who\nfound himself not only acting as the local arbiter of family\ndisputes but also providing a local, much appreciated,\nmedical service using a handbook called When There is No\nDoctor, who kept on securing supplies from his wife in\nGermany and the field hospital in Phnomh Penh for his\nKhmer community? Or the United Nations military observer\nwho spent his leave in Bangkok fund-raising for a water\nfilter for a remote Cambodian village? Now, they happen to\nbe British, but such servants of the world come from many\ncountries.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19\nWe in Britain are committed to our peace-keeping\ncontribution. We now have over 3,300 men and women in\nblue berets around the world.\nIn June the Secretary-General asked Member States to\nidentify for him those areas of United Nations peace-keeping\noperations which needed strengthening and for our ideas on\npositive steps we could take. I look forward to his report\ndrawing all those responses together.\nUseful steps have certainly been taken. There is now\na 24-hour operations room, improving the ability of those\nhere in New York to oversee operations around the world.\nThe standby force planning project has been started. A new\nDepartment of Peace-keeping Operations is responsible for\nall United Nations field missions. We can build on these\nimprovements.\nGood organization involves clarity and sobriety in\nsetting out our objectives. That means that any operation\nmust have clear and achievable objectives linked to a\npolitical process which offers reasonable hope of a solution,\nand to which all parties should be committed. The mandate\nshould be precise and finite. That means adequate support\nat Headquarters for planning and reconnaissance missions.\nIt means that the Security Council must resist the temptation\nto become involved in the detailed conduct of operations. It\nmeans the mandate must not create impossible obligations\nfor a force commander on the ground. Once an operation is\nagreed, command and control relationships could be more\nclearly defined.\nUnity of command at the highest level is essential.\nWhere the United Nations is charged with executing as well\nas authorizing a peace-keeping operation, all aspects of it\nshould be handled by a single department in New York.\nThat is why we have suggested the creation of an expanded\nplanning and operations staff. This in effect is a general\nstaff for peace-keeping. These men and women, civilian and\nmilitary, would be able together to provide the necessary\ncore of the United Nations strategic-planning chain. They\nwould operate mainly here in New York, but also in the\nfield. They would provide the United Nations with the\nnervous system for which its present staff is neither\nstructured nor resourced.\nWe are not proposing here some new and heavy\nbureaucracy. On the contrary, we are talking about core\nstaff: trained staff officers, United Nations civil affairs and,\nincreasingly, humanitarian advisers, and chief administrative\nofficers. The example of the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), of a special\nenvoy for all humanitarian and refugee aspects of an\noperation, is good.\nThen, there must be flexibility in running peace-keeping\noperations. The more comprehensive a bureaucracy\nbecomes, the harder it is for it to stay nimble on its feet.\nDoctrinal and administrative difficulties in working with\nother international organizations can be overcome. For\nexample, the United Nations is already building valuable\nlinks with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE) and with the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO). Many peace-keeping and\npeacemaking operations can be run more effectively by\nregional organizations or single countries on behalf of the\nUnited Nations. That depends on the nature of the problem\nand on the proposed action agreed by the United Nations.\nI am thinking, for example, of the Economic Community of\nWest African States (ECOWAS) in Liberia, the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) in Rwanda, and the European\nCommunity and NATO in the former Yugoslavia.\nRegional organizations can also be asked to help with\ntraining. We might look at getting certain nations with well-\ntrained, equipped and available forces to provide the first\nwave of a peace-keeping force, allowing other nations the\ntime to train and equip their forces to the required standard.\nA commitment to deploy early would of course need to be\nmatched by a United Nations commitment to agree a firm\nend-date for the deployment, because exits can be as\nimportant as entrances.\nWhat we cannot do, we should not pretend to do. If\nwe play a game of bluff, we can deceive and disappoint\nothers, and sometimes we deceive and disappoint ourselves.\nRarely can we attain our ends that way. It is empty to\npretend that we can impose peace with justice on every\ndisorder, every dispute, outside our national borders.\nBut what the United Nations can do, it should do well.\nCambodia, for example, is a success story. So was Namibia.\nOur peace-keepers have been able to limit, though not stop,\nconflict and to assuage, though not bring to and end,\nsuffering in Bosnia and Somalia. But the authority of the\nUnited Nations will suffer if it fails to approach new\nchallenges realistically and flexibly.\nHowever important peace-keeping may be, successful\npreventive diplomacy would be better. I have just been\nreading the book published this week by our Australian\ncolleague, the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth\nEvans. His new book, Cooperating for Peace, brings this\npoint out well and is full of fruitful ideas. Defusing trouble\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncosts a great deal less than a military operation. You can\nfield plenty of emissaries for the price of a battalion. But to\nbe useful, of course, an emissary has to set about his work\nbefore the excitement of violence has taken hold.\nThe Secretary-General has been energetic here. He has\nsent missions to several areas of tension - to Tajikistan and\nother regions of the former Soviet Union, to Macedonia, to\nSouth Africa and elsewhere.\nBut in this as in other parts of the United Nations\nsystem money is tight. Many missions create an acute need\nfor additional international staff with the necessary skills. I\nam thinking not just of eminent people, of retired ministers\nor distinguished ambassadors who can head such missions.\nThe Secretary-General will find them when he needs them.\nWhat he needs from Member States is personnel at a more\njunior level with local experience and negotiating skills.\nNow, we have discussed this problem in particular with\nthe French Government, and as an Anglo-French initiative\nwe stand ready to provide the Secretariat with a list of such\npeople, people who have experience in Government service -\nsometimes outside Government service - and whom we\nwould be prepared to make available for particular missions.\nWe would also be prepared to provide a certain amount of\nequipment where personnel provided by the United Kingdom\nwere involved. We are ready to respond to the invitation of\nthe Secretary-General in \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" to provide\ninformation crucial to the task of preventive diplomacy. The\nBritish and French Governments are both committed to\nsupport him in this way, and we hope that others may join\nin a similar enterprise.\nAll this work means a financial burden. Of course we\nshould all pay our assessed contribution in full and promptly.\nWe do so. So do most of our European partners, the Nordic\ncountries and those with a long tradition of peace-keeping\nlike Australia and Canada. But others, not entirely or\nalways through their own fault, others who share the heavy\nburden of international responsibility, do not.\nThe fact is, the United Nations will always be short\nof money. Even if everybody pays up in full and on time,\nthe United Nations will still have to choose priorities within\nthe resources available to it. That means - and will always\nmean - turning down some good causes, and reappraising\nand sometimes bringing to an end existing commitments.\nThe United Nations needs to conduct a rigorous\nscrutiny of what it needs and what it spends. Obviously, it\nwould be able to afford more operations if it ran the existing\nones more economically. Without thrift, without financial\nprobity, the authority of the United Nations will weaken and\nvanish. So we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s recent\nadditional senior appointments at the level of Assistant\nSecretary-General, covering administrative and financial\naffairs. We support proposals for a system of inspection\nwith teeth, which can match more delegated financial\nauthority to the field.\nI mention these three areas - peace-keeping, preventive\ndiplomacy and finance. If we can tackle these three areas\nconstructively and vigorously, there is no reason why even\nunder present strains the authority of the United Nations\nshould not grow as strikingly as the burden of expectations\nnow placed upon it. People will always continue to turn to\nthe United Nations, even if they will always expect more of\nus than is conceivable.\nWe are discussing, in that context, reform, and we in\nBritain welcome the debate on Security Council reform. We\nare discussing positively the enlargement of the Council.\nThis will be complex, as our debate already makes clear,\nbecause there are many currents and cross-currents of view.\nI do not doubt that if there were to be consensus on\nenlarging the Security Council there are some countries\nwhich, because of their global interests, their contribution to\ninternational security, their contribution to United Nations\npeace-keeping, could undertake the full range of\nresponsibilities of a permanent member and can certainly be\nexpected to do so.\nI have concentrated simply on this Organization for the\nreason which I gave. Few tasks are more important than\nimproving the way the United Nations works if we are to\nsecure a more stable world. We have lived through the\nevents of these last few years. They have been dramatic and\nexhilarating, they have changed the political and strategic\nlandscape, but they have not removed from us our\nresponsibility to work constructively for a better United\nNations. This better world order will not happen because we\nmake a few speeches or pass a few resolutions. It will be\nconstructed steadily, brick by brick, learning always the right\nlessons from the past, developing steadily our international\ninstitutions and our international relations.\nIt is fair to say that in the last four years, with its ups\nand downs, we have come a long way, and I believe that,\ntogether, we have the will and the wisdom to continue along\nthat road.\n"

There seemed to be a fresh possibility of building a\nnew international order based on sound moral principles,\nnamely the principles of justice, law, freedom and\ndemocracy.\nThe Gulf crisis, caused by Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait,\noffered the international community an opportunity to react\nresolutely to restore the rights thus violated. The principles\nof condemnation of the use or the threat of the use of force\nas a means of settling disputes were underscored. The\ninadmissibility and illegitimacy of the acquisition of\nterritories through force were reaffirmed. The principles of\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States\nwere strengthened. Ecuador was gratified to see the\nresultant reinforcement of the fundamental and age-old\npillars of its international policy.\nThe world today aspires more firmly and decisively to\nlive in freedom and democracy and in an atmosphere of full\nrespect for human rights.\nThis fundamental change has allowed the spread, not\nonly of positive forces, but also of underlying conflicts\nwhich, within various regions, have set off apparently\nuncontainable escalation.\nThe United Nations, whose prestige had reached new\nheights, was facing increasingly numerous, pressing and\ncomplex problems. Extreme nationalism had flared up in the\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 17\nBalkans and elsewhere, while the breakdown of authority\nhad given rise to tragic humanitarian situations in Somalia\nand in other regions. In Cambodia, the Organization had to\ncontribute to rebuilding the State.\nThe problems have not disappeared; on the contrary,\nthey proliferate in the former Socialist Federal Republic of\nYugoslavia and in the former Soviet Union. The large\nnumbers of refugees created by war serve as a pretext for\nextremist, nationalist and xenophobic ideologies to arise in\nthe very heart of Europe.\nThe world, which applauded United Nations action on\nthe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, is examining with a critical eye\nthe Organization\u2019s inaction and ineffectiveness in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. In Bonn, the graffiti read, \\\"Europe is dying in\nSarajevo\\\". In the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, the use of force and\nthe acquisition of territory by force was condemned, but it\nseems that in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina the use of\nforce is being allowed to yield results and to expand the\nterritory of the aggressor. Here is a clear illustration that\ninternational morality is opposed to double standards of\naction.\nIn that context, Ecuador views as vital the work under\nway to restructure and strengthen the world Organization.\nThe General Assembly must shoulder with greater authority\nits responsibilities as the most representative democratic\norgan of the United Nations. The Security Council needs to\nbe restructured to reflect the striking changes in the\nmembership of the United Nations and to ensure that it is\nmore representative and, hence, more legitimate. We\ncommend all the steps being taken to that end, and we\nsupport others that still need to be taken to ensure that the\nwork of the Council is characterized by vision and\ntransparency. We think that its membership should be\nexpanded, within limits ensuring that its work will be\neffective and aimed at the democratization of the\nOrganization. Democratizing participation in the Council\u2019s\nwork requires the presence of States of special significance\non the international scene, such as Germany and Japan, and\nof representatives of other geographical areas not now\nproperly represented.\nThe work of the United Nations in the economic and\nsocial fields should be strengthened and made more\neffective. We must not forget that peace is threatened not\nonly by military aggression but also, and even more, by\nsituations of injustice or crisis that ought to be settled in a\nspirit of international solidarity. For that reason, Ecuador\nlooks forward to seeing as soon as possible the report the\nGeneral Assembly has requested of the Secretary-General, on\nan agenda for development.\nEcuador was pleased by the results of the recent World\nConference on Human Rights. We believe that the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action constitute an\nimportant step forward towards recognizing the universal\nnature of human rights. The right to development is\nuniversal and inalienable. Ecuador appeals to all States to\nmake an effort to implement the goals and purposes of the\nVienna Programme of Action.\nEcuador is deeply gratified by the positive\ndevelopments in South Africa. We hope that the elections\nscheduled for 1994 will mark the conclusive establishment\nof a democratic, non-racial, pluralistic society truly free and\nopen to progress.\nThe most important element of progress may well be\nsocial development. For that reason, Ecuador firmly\nsupported the initiative to convene the World Summit for\nSocial Development. We reiterate our backing for the\ninternational community\u2019s decision, which will add meaning\nto the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe world economy is at a difficult stage. Even the\ndeveloped economies are in deep crisis. We must adopt a\nnew monetary and fiscal policy aimed at promoting short-\nterm recovery and at eliminating structural imbalances in the\nmedium term. It is vital to coordinate the macro-economic\npolicies of the strongest countries in order to promote world\neconomic growth. It is necessary also to take account of the\nlegitimate interests of all countries, especially developing\ncountries.\nIt will be impossible to maintain and bolster our\ndemocracies without at the same time engaging in economic\nand social programmes aimed at improved living standards\nfor all. In addressing these issues we should not rely solely\non old economic statistical systems, but should turn to\nsystems that evaluate the quality of life, such as that\nproposed by the United Nations Development Programme.\nI would recall that a country\u2019s domestic policies play a\ndominant part in its development process. Ecuador has\ndecided to carry out serious and thorough structural reforms\nthat will permit greater scope for private enterprise and\nindividual initiative and that will reduce Government\nintervention wherever it has proved to be ineffective and\ninappropriate.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nEconomic development is meaningful when it addresses\nhuman reality. To achieve this, we must be firmly\ncommitted to modernizing the State and, by our example,\nensuring that morality prevails in the work of the\nGovernment.\nBut national efforts to modernize the State and open the\neconomy to the universal trend towards freedom require\ntimely, adequate financial support. This should be obtained,\nbasically, by establishing a trading system making possible\nfair prices for commodities and other exports of developing\ncountries. Ironically, while they make splendid speeches in\nfavour of free trade, the powerful countries continue to\nimpose measures that contradict their fine words. One\nexample is the import barriers on Latin American bananas\nimposed by the European Economic Community.\nWe are concerned about what results will issue from\nthe Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We need\ntransparent machinery to fight protectionism; this must result\nfrom true international negotiations.\nFor many countries, certainly including Ecuador, the\nexternal debt continues to be one of the most serious\nproblems and one that has the heaviest negative impact, not\nonly in the economic but also in the social and even political\nfields. We must review the financial policies of the\ninternational credit agencies and complement their resources\nwith direct private investment, so that the flow of capital\nfrom the developing world to the developed countries does\nnot, as has happened to date, exceed the amount of aid or\ninvestment channelled to the developing countries.\nPrudent and appropriate regulation of the environment\nand development is a task that concerns and interests us all.\nWe must promote sustainable development that will meet\nhumanity\u2019s needs today without jeopardizing the rights of\nfuture generations. The Rio Conference is of far-reaching\nimportance and the fulfilment of the decisions and\ncommitments undertaken there is crucial. Agenda 21 is a\nhistoric document requiring political resolve on the part of\nall if it is to be put into effect. In that regard, the\nestablishment and consolidation of financial sources is\nessential.\nIn the context of international security it is vitally\nimportant that all international agreements concluded within\nthe framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency\nbe strictly complied with, and that the inspection systems be\nstrengthened to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nIn this respect, we support all efforts to create new\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and we voice our concern at any\nfailure to comply with the resolutions relating to the Korean\npeninsula. We urge the Government of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to heed the just demands of the\ninternational community.\nToday, I have heard with great concern of a possible\nbreach of the moratorium on nuclear testing by the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China. If that information is confirmed, it will\nrepresent a grave step backwards in the process of\nestablishing moratoriums on nuclear testing. We hope that\nit will not trigger a rush to new testing on the part of other\nnuclear Powers.\nIn Latin America, democracy and freedom have been\nstrengthened. It is our hope that, by means of the exercise\nof the right of peoples to self-determination, Latin American\nwill soon be free of the remaining exceptions.\nThe case of Haiti is particularly disquieting. Respect\nfor democracy and human values is a basic pillar of civilized\ncoexistence. Ecuador believes that the joint action of the\ninternational community must encourage a new phase that\nwill provide the Haitian people with certain basic guarantees.\nThroughout its history, Ecuador has demonstrated its\npeaceful spirit in true and unquestionable terms. In that\nspirit, it participated in the United Nations Observer Group\nin Central America and the United Nations Observer Mission\nin El Salvador. It continues to support the latter and has\noffered its forces for other peace-keeping operations.\nThe proliferation of peace-keeping operations has\nhighlighted the need to carry out a careful review of the\nconditions in which these operations are created and carried\nout and the limits of their respective mandates. This\nOrganization should set the example of austerity in fund\nmanagement in order to enhance its moral authority and its\neffectiveness.\nIn the light of its special links with Latin America,\nEcuador attaches particular importance to its relations with\nneighbouring countries. Our Government has strengthened\nand expanded its traditional relations with Colombia, and\nthey have recently been evolving with great promise.\nA similar process is under way between the\nGovernments of Ecuador and Peru. The Presidents of\nEcuador and Peru have given repeated and eloquent proof of\ntheir political resolve to make progress in the process of\ndialogue that has opened between the two countries. This\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 19\nprocess will enable us to ensure a climate of friendship, trust\nand understanding and to narrow the differences in our\npositions on the territorial issue. Together we can make\nsignificant steps towards promoting the well-being of our\npeoples, and as we move towards understanding we will be\nable to overcome the differences which have long been an\nobstacle in the way of a new era of fruitful coexistence.\nThe Government of Ecuador was pleased and very\ngrateful to note the demonstrations of support from many\ncountries, particularly American ones, for our dialogue with\nPeru. We also appreciated the message that His Holiness\nPope John Paul II addressed to President Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n\nand President Alberto Fujimori on the occasion of their\nmeeting in Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1ques in December 1992.\nEcuador, by tradition and inclination, has been a peace-\nloving nation and believes that the only valid way to\novercome the territorial differences persisting between it and\nPeru lies in the peaceful settlement of disputes. One option\nin that regard is the arbitration of His Holiness the Pope,\nwho, with his lofty moral authority and his enduring\ndevotion to understanding and harmony among peoples, is\nextremely well qualified. That is why the Constitutional\nPresident of Ecuador, Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n, speaking from this\nvery rostrum at the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, reiterated the initiative which former Ecuadorian\nPresident Rodrigo Borja set forth at the forty-sixth session\nof the General Assembly concerning the arbitration of the\nHoly See.\nIn response to this initiative and in keeping with the\nspirit of dialogue that has been maintained and cultivated\nbetween the two countries, the President of Peru proposed\nthe participation of the Holy See through the mediation of an\nexpert adviser who would offer his opinion from the point\nof view of that neighbouring and friendly country with\nrespect to the \\\"frontier disputes\\\" with Ecuador.\nWe now have two proposals that are distinct in scope\nand content: on the one hand, arbitration, and on the other\nthe assistance of an expert adviser. But they coincide in\ntheir recognition of the great help to be had from the Pontiff,\nwho in the course of history has traditionally worked for\nrapprochement and understanding among peoples. These\nvery differences and varied proposals highlight the need to\npreserve and strengthen the process of dialogue between the\ntwo countries. Ecuador is faithfully committed to that\nprocess with a view not only to finding the fairest, most\nrealistic and honourable solution to the problem, but also in\norder to respond appropriately to all the possibilities for\ncomplementary action, cooperation and joint endeavour that\nthese two countries could and should pursue with a view to\nsecuring the development, integration and well-being for\ntheir peoples.\nThus, we shall no longer be divided by borders and\nborders will become points of union and of promising\ncooperation, with tremendous scope and possibilities. This\nhas been the case with regard to the maritime area that we\nshare; this is the hope of the two peoples, especially the\npeoples of southern Ecuador and northern Peru; this must be\nthe case with regard to the Amazon River meeting for a\nhistoric reconciliation of our two nations that adequately\nmeets the major interests of the two countries in the Amazon\nregion and identifies them in plans that take account of their\nindividual and collective rights, enhance their potential and\ncreate conditions reflecting the importance of a major river\nsystem and a region that all the countries of the basin must\npreserve and promote for the sake of current development as\nwell as the future well-being of our peoples.\nIn this spirit of frank and constructive dialogue,\nPresident Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n accepted the kind invitation of\nPresident Alberto Fujimori to visit Peru. Ecuador\u2019s Foreign\nMinistry is busy making preparations with the authorities of\nthat friendly country for this mission so that the greatest\npossible success may be achieved.\nA few days ago the world enthusiastically welcomed\nthe handshake between two courageous men who had opted\nfor peace and understanding. I should like, on behalf of\nEcuador, to pay tribute to Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin and\nPresident Yasser Arafat. I am confident that this gesture,\nthis historic event, will be not only the beginning of a tough\nbut promising relationship aimed at securing understanding\nand cooperation between the two peoples but also a signal,\na sign of the times, for many other peoples who have to\npursue the arduous path of peace and understanding.\nFor this reason, President Clinton was absolutely right\nwhen, on that historic morning, he said:\n\\\"We know that a difficult path lies before us.\nEvery peace has its own enemies - those who always\nprefer the easy attitudes of hatred to the hard task of\nreconciliation.\\\"\nEcuador believes in peace and trusts in peace and\nunderstanding. Hence, I wish to associate myself with the\nnoble words of Cardinal Antonio Samor\u00e9, the delegate of the\nHoly Father in the Papal mediation between the fraternal\ncountries of Argentina and Chile, in his speech at the time\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nof the signing, in Montevideo, of the commitment between\nthe two countries:\n\\\"I say to all of you - Christians, believers and men\nof good will: do not be afraid to opt for peace, to\neducate for peace. The aspiration to peace will never\nbe disappointed. The endeavour to achieve peace\ninspired by charity that never fails will yield its fruits.\nPeace will be the last word in history.\\\"\nAgainst this background, and with a view to ensuring\nthat these efforts are made in an appropriate climate of\ngenuine understanding and harmony and will be effective, I\nformally take the opportunity, at this rostrum, to propose to\nthe Government of Peru that, reaffirming the commitment\nthat both countries have made in accordance with many\nexisting international instruments - principally, the United\nNations Charter - we give our word of honour that, in our\nmutual relations, we shall not resort to force or to the threat\nof the use of force. Such a solemn commitment would\nunderscore an essential legal obligation and amount to an\neloquent additional means of promoting mutual trust; and it\nwould be an appropriate framework for continued dialogue\non the path of peace and understanding, with a view to\nachieving, as soon as possible, a fair, honourable and lasting\nsettlement between the two countries.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I should like to begin by congratulating you\non your election to the presidency of the General Assembly\nand by expressing our confidence in your ability to steer the\nproceedings of the present session.\nI also express our gratitude to the outgoing President,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the dedicated way in which he\nfulfilled his mandate and contributed to the rationalization of\nthe work of the Assembly.\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose initiative and commitment\nhave already made it possible to take important steps\ntowards a thorough reform of the United Nations and\ntowards strengthening its international credibility as an\nirreplaceable instrument of peace.\nThe universal calling of the United Nations, enshrined\nin its Charter, gives special meaning to the accession of six\nnew Member States, Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea,\nthe Slovak Republic, Monaco and the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia; they have reinforced the legitimacy\nof this forum and assumed, before the international\ncommunity, the responsibility entailed in the full exercise of\nnational sovereignty.\nMy Belgian colleague, in his capacity as current\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the European\nCommunities, has already had the opportunity to make a\nstatement on behalf of the 12 member States; Portugal fully\nsubscribes to that statement. I should, however, like to refer\nto a number of issues that are of particular importance to my\ncountry.\nThe period of global transition now before us is marked\nby particularly contradictory signs.\nOn the one hand, the d\u00e9tente that surfaced with the end\nof the cold war has led to an increase in regional integration\nand the strengthening of cooperation between States, and has\nbrought to life the concept of complementing the activities\nof the United Nations with those of regional organizations\nand arrangements.\nOn the other hand, violent nationalistic claims have\nre-emerged and old and seemingly forgotten antagonisms\nhave resurfaced, leading to an unexpected outbreak of\nconflicts that threaten the internal cohesion of States and\ninternational peace and security.\nIn this context, and more so than ever, the role of the\nUnited Nations collective security system, now back on the\nfront line of international relations, seems decisive. For this\nreason, we attach great significance to the ongoing\nrestructuring of the Secretariat. We also deem particularly\nimportant the reform of the Security Council, which has\nspecial responsibilities and is now free to accomplish its\noriginal mission and to emerge as the driving force behind\nthe Organization\u2019s political activities in maintaining stability\nand peace.\nOther organizations, such as the European Community,\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\nhave, in their turn, an important role to play in consolidating\ndemocracy, maintaining stability and promoting development\nin the entire European region.\nIt is essential for close cooperation to be established\nbetween those bodies and the United Nations - which has a\nprimary and universal responsibility - so as to avoid\nduplication and to enhance what each can contribute to the\nsearch for peace and stability.\nPeace-keeping operations have recently undergone a\nconsiderable expansion, and we are witnessing the\ndeployment of large numbers of men and women in\nsituations of various natures, including the protection of\nhumanitarian assistance missions and preventive diplomacy\ninitiatives. The involvement of military contingents in those\noperations requires clear political aims as well as unity of\ncommand and close and permanent coordination between the\nSecretariat and the interested parties, namely the contributing\nStates and those States that may be able to offer, in a\nconstructive manner, a political contribution to the peace\nprocesses.\nResolving the conflicts of today, building peace and\npreventing the conflicts of tomorrow will be no simple task.\nThe demands and expectations that fall upon the United\nNations have no historical precedent, and so every effort\nmust be made to turn \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" into a reality.\nOnly then will the Organization be able to cope with\nthe present and future challenges of maintaining peace,\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ngiving humanitarian assistance and providing aid for\ndevelopment.\nUnfortunately, as I speak, the United Nations is\nconfronting its greatest financial crisis in 48 years of\nexistence and is facing the risk of not being able to assume\nits responsibilities in the important domain of maintaining\ninternational security.\nThis question remains the cornerstone of the future\nactivity of the United Nations. If it remains unanswered, the\nconsequences for the United Nation credibility and for world\npeace will be dramatic.\nAn important development that has resulted from the\nend of the cold war concerns respect for human rights,\nwhich are inalienable and universal and figure above all\nother considerations when we look at a particular political\nregime or model of society. We believe that it is necessary\nfor the international community today to judge violations of\nhuman rights without double standards.\nIn this respect, I should like to stress the importance of\nthe final declaration of the Vienna Conference, which\nemphasizes fundamental ideas and principles, specifically,\nthose that concern the responsibilities of the international\ncommunity in this area and define human rights as a priority\nfor the United Nations. With this aim, it is now urgent for\nthe General Assembly to discuss, without delay, the\nestablishment of the post of high commissioner for human\nrights.\nA commonality of values that reflect the dignity of the\nhuman person is an indispensable component of a better\ninternational order allowing the development of peaceful and\nlasting international relations. Thus, together with peace,\ndevelopment and democracy, we consider human rights to be\none of the basic principles that should govern international\nsociety.\nIt is precisely because of the imperatives of human\nsolidarity, and because we believe that the international\ncommunity has an important role to play, that Portugal, both\nas a State and as a member of the European Community, is\nfollowing with deep concern the conflict that, for the last\ntwo years, has been devastating parts of the territory of the\nformer Yugoslavia. Portugal reiterates its firm position that\nonly a settlement accepted by the three parties can put an\nend to this blood-stained chapter in European history.\nThe Portuguese Government truly regrets the\ninterruption of the latest negotiating round in Geneva at a\ntime when an agreement seemed within reach.\nWe once again urge all the parties involved in the\nconflict to show the necessary good will and flexibility so as\nto put an end to the suffering of the affected populations.\nPortugal considers that it is extremely urgent for a viable\nand just peace agreement to be signed: Only thus will the\nconditions for a return to peace be met.\nLastly, I wish to pay a tribute to the United Nations\nProtection Force - in which Portugal has the privilege of\nbeing included - to the European Community monitoring\nmission and to all humanitarian organizations operating in\nthe area of the former Yugoslavia for the tasks they have\nperformed under circumstances of particular hardship.\nPortugal, a country which is historically and culturally\nlinked to Africa, is profoundly aware of the unparalleled,\nappalling and ever-deteriorating living conditions prevailing\nin vast regions of the continent. Today, Africa certainly\ndeserves the international community\u2019s special attention. It\nis in Africa that we should concentrate our principal efforts\nto end wars that are sometimes forgotten, but that are laying\nwaste to large areas, and it is to Africa that we should be\ndirecting economic resources in quantities commensurate\nwith the unparalleled scale of the problems it is facing.\nOnly by increasing trade flows, economic ties and\nhumanitarian assistance can we provide a degree of certainty\nfor the success of democratization and progress.\nI should like to refer also to the utmost importance that\nwe attach to the work of the Organization of African Unity\nin the search for solutions to bring an end to the conflicts\nthat overshadow Africa.\nIn Africa, there are five countries that officially use\nPortuguese. With these countries we have steadily deepened\nour ties in all areas. Based on a common culture and values,\nwe are developing, together with Brazil and these African\ncountries, a true community of Portuguese-speaking nations\nthat is characterized by solidarity and tolerance.\nIt was precisely because of these special ties that my\nGovernment interceded in the Angolan conflict. The\nmediation efforts it deployed there, together with the United\nStates and Russia, resulted in the signing in Lisbon of the\nAcordos de Paz on 31 May 1991. The year and a half of\npeace that followed those agreements raised in all the\nAngolan people the legitimate expectation that almost\n30 years of war were coming to an end. It also revealed\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 13\nstimulating signs of economic recovery and the advent of a\nnew era of democracy and national reconciliation. Angolans\ntherefore participated massively in the elections of last\nSeptember. The resurgence of war in Angola cause by\nUNITA\u2019s failure to accept the results of the elections calls\nfor a new effort from the international community to re--\nestablish the cease-fire and to safeguard the democratic\nprocess, in accordance with the legitimate wishes for peace\nand democracy of the Angolan people.\nPortugal welcomed the adoption on 15 September of\nSecurity Council resolution 864 (1993), in which the\nCouncil, in the wake of previous resolutions and under\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, decided\nupon a set of important measures.\nI remain convinced that dialogue is possible, and that\nonly through direct negotiations between the Government of\nAngola and UNITA can a lasting solution and a durable\npeace be found. I therefore once again urge UNITA to\nreturn to the negotiating table, on the basis of the Acordos\nde Paz and full acceptance of the outcome of the\nSeptember 1992 elections and the Abidjan guidelines, which\nwere reached with the invaluable help of President\nHouphouet-Boigny and the Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nI applaud the peace initiatives undertaken by the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, to which Portugal,\ntogether with the two other countries of the troika of\nobservers, the United States and Russia, has given its\nstrongest support.\nOnly with the restoration of peace will it be possible to\nbring about an end to the suffering of the Angolan people\nand make possible the provision of the much-needed\nhumanitarian assistance that the international community is\nready to provide. In this respect, the efforts already made\nby the specialized agencies of the United Nations and the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross are to be\ncommended.\nRegarding Mozambique, the role of the United Nations\nin conducting the peace process is for us a source of\nsatisfaction. In this context, we welcome the adoption of\nSecurity Council resolution 850 (1993), which is a sign of\nthe Organization\u2019s unequivocal commitment to bringing this\nprocess to a satisfactory conclusion.\nPortugal is deeply involved in the Mozambique peace\nprocess, not only through its active contribution to the\nUnited Nations Operation in Mozambique but also through\nits participation in the structures created by the General\nPeace Agreement and through our contributions pledged\nduring the donors\u2019 conference last December.\nWe also welcome the results of the recent meeting\nbetween the President of Mozambique and the leader of\nRENAMO, which represented a breakthrough and gave\nreason for hope in a future of peace and prosperity in\nMozambique.\nThe positive outcome of that meeting, namely, the\nagreement on the issues of territorial administration and\npolice, has been recognized by Security Council resolution\n863 (1993), in which all parties are urged to implement\nwithout delay all the provisions of the General Peace\nAgreement so that the elections can be held in October 1994\nat the latest.\nConcerning South Africa, we are following events there\nclosely, in particular the multiparty negotiations, which we\nhope will meet with success and constitute the foundations\nof a new, multiracial reality.\nThe withdrawal of significant forces in South African\nsociety from those negotiations is a cause for concern, and\ncould have a negative impact on the normal course of the\ntransition process, which, as we all hope, will end with the\nholding of elections next year.\nThe spread of violence in South Africa provides a\nspecial cause for concern, as pointed out by the European\nCommunity observer mission in South Africa and the\nGoldstone Commission, in both of which Portugal is\nparticipating actively. We deeply regret the violence, which\ncannot but jeopardize the path to national reconciliation.\nWe must stress, however, the positive aspect, namely\nthe progress achieved with the 7 September agreement at the\nmultiparty negotiations on the creation of the Transitional\nExecutive Council. This was achieved by the efforts of the\nvarious parties that believe in a consensus solution for the\npolitical transition in South Africa.\nI should also like to refer to Mr. Nelson Mandela\u2019s\npraiseworthy appeal, before the Special Committee against\nApartheid, for an end to the economic sanctions imposed\nagainst South Africa, an appeal which constitutes a valuable\nencouragement to the process of political reform initiated by\nPresident F. W. de Klerk.\nLeaving now the African continent, I would say that\nPortugal, because of its very important legal, moral and\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nhistoric responsibilities in the case, continues to devote, as\na matter of priority, particular attention to the question of\nEast Timor, a Non-Self-Governing Territory recognized by\nthe United Nations as being under Portuguese administration,\nits decolonization process not having been completed.\nI should like to reaffirm, at this rostrum, my country\u2019s\nposition of principle on this question: Portugal accepts in\nfull the relevant resolutions adopted by the General\nAssembly and Security Council regarding East Timor.\nThese resolutions reaffirm the need to apply, in the case of\nEast Timor, the essential principles and rules adopted by this\nOrganization on decolonization; those contained not only in\nthe Charter, but in the historic resolutions 1514 (XV) and\n1541 (XV) as well. The rejection of military conquest as the\nbasis for claiming territorial enlargement, the need to respect\nEast Timor\u2019s territorial integrity and the right of its people\nto self-determination are clearly established in those\nresolutions.\nWe remain firmly committed to achieving, in a peaceful\nand negotiated manner, a just, comprehensive and\ninternationally acceptable settlement to this question. That\nsettlement must not fail to meet the standards of\ninternational law and must fully respect the legitimate rights\nof the East Timorese, who are those most directly concerned\nand who have been the principal victims of this painful and\nlong-protracted problem.\nI should especially like to applaud the efforts of the\nSecretary-General - and those of his collaborators - under\nwhose auspices talks have been held with Indonesia aimed\nat settling this issue. We do recognize how very difficult\nthis task is as a result of the wide gap between the positions\nof the parties on the substance of the question, which is the\nconclusion of the process of the decolonization of the\nTerritory. Three rounds of discussions have already taken\nplace at the Ministerial level, and we are in the process of\nadopting a set of confidence-building measures in order to\nimprove the atmosphere of dialogue and to foster the\nadvancement of the process.\nAllow me to quote, in this context, a passage of the\nprogress report submitted, just a few days ago, by the\nSecretary-General to the General Assembly:\n\\\"Equally important and intrinsically linked to the\npeace process is the human rights situation in East\nTimor. The improvement of the conditions in East\nTimor is sine qua non to progress in the talks\\\".\n(A/48/418, para. 5)\nI am sorry to have to say that, unfortunately, the human\nrights situation prevailing in the territory continues to elicit\ncondemnation on the part of the international community.\nThe resolutions adopted this year by the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights and by its Subcommission on\nPrevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities\nare a clear demonstration of this. We sincerely hope that\nsteps will be taken that will bring about a tangible and\ngenuine improvement of the situation in the territory and that\nthis can be monitored without obstruction. I therefore call\nupon all Governments and human rights organizations to\ncontinue to keep a close eye on the situation in East Timor.\nWe are witnessing events of great significance in other\nparts of the world. Allow me to emphasize those which\nmerit our particular attention.\nPortugal remains faithful to the construction of an\nenlarged and strengthened Europe. We are close, therefore,\nto the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and, guided\nby that objective, we propose to contribute through our\nparticipation in the framework of the European Community\nwith a view to enhancing dialogue as well as political and\neconomic cooperation. This approach will ensure peace,\nstability and economic well-being.\nIn this context of the joint responsibility of all actors on\nthe international scene, we should encourage the ongoing\npolitical and economic reforms in the States that have\nemerged from the collapse of the former Soviet Union aimed\nat a peaceful evolution towards democratic societies based\non the rule of law and fundamental human rights. We\nsupport their progressive integration into the international\neconomy, which will prevent the political division of the\npast from being replaced with a new economic gap.\nAllow me to salute at this point President Yeltsin for\nhis courage and determination to carry on without\ninterruption the process of political and economic reform\nthat is indispensable for the complete democratization and\ndevelopment of the Russian Federation.\nWe lend our unequivocal support to all the efforts made\nby the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) and the United Nations - which constitute a good\ntest for cooperation between regional organizations and the\nUnited Nations - to reach peaceful settlements to the\ndisputes that have arisen on the territory of the former Soviet\nUnion.\nRegarding nuclear arms control and disarmament,\nPortugal considers the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 15\nNuclear Weapons to be an instrument of major importance,\nand looks forward to its indefinite extension at the 1995\nReview Conference. Portugal urges all the parties that have\nnot yet done so to ratify it, and reiterates the need for all the\nnuclear-weapon States that have emerged from the former\nSoviet Union to implement and comply with the obligations\nresulting from the START I and START II Treaties and the\nLisbon Protocol.\nAt this point, allow me to stress the importance my\nGovernment attaches to the work of the Conference on\nDisarmament, to which my country has recently presented its\ncandidature for full membership.\nI wish to refer here to the current negotiations that are\nseeking to conclude the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade talks. While we hope for their successful conclusion,\nwhich we consider to be fundamental for the world\neconomy, we also believe that the result should reflect a\nglobal and balanced solution based on an opening of markets\nand a reinforcement of the rules of international trade.\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\nGovernment of Israel and the leaders of the Palestine\nLiberation Organization for the realism, lucidity, courage and\nalso imagination they displayed with the conclusion of the\nrecent agreement, which represents a historic step towards\nthe achievement of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\nfor the Middle East based upon the relevant resolutions of\nthe United Nations. The agreement will certainly lend a new\nand encouraging vitality to the peace process in both its\nbilateral and multilateral tracks, irreversibly consolidating the\nlatest developments.\nGeographical proximity and historic and cultural ties\njustify the genuine attention with which my country is\nfollowing the evolution of the situation in the Maghreb.\nPortugal has stressed, within the European Community and\nin other international forums, the importance of that region\nto security and stability in the Mediterranean. In this sense,\nthe declaration of the Heads of State and Government at the\nLisbon meeting of the Council of Europe set out a new\napproach to a political, economic, social and cultural\ndialogue between the European Community and the Maghreb.\nPortugal has centuries-old relations of friendship with\nLatin America. Our special relationship with Brazil cannot\nbe overemphasized. We are therefore in a position, in the\nspirit of the recent Ibero-American Summit in Salvador da\nBahia, to enhance dialogue and cooperation with this region.\nIn this respect, I should like to stress the importance we\nattach to an agenda for development in the advancement of\na constructive and effective dialogue aimed at identifying\nand exploring new forms of solidarity in encouraging\ninternational cooperation for development.\nIn respect of the activities of the European Community,\nwe have been striving to strengthen European ties with Latin\nAmerica, through the San Jos\u00e9 process and the Rio group,\nby encouraging the efforts - which have already made\nprogress possible - aimed at increasing respect for\ndemocratic institutions and human rights and developing new\nforms of economic integration.\nI should also like to mention the current negotiations on\nthe preservation of natural resources and the maintenance of\nenvironmental balance. The obligations of States go beyond\nthe mere signature of multilateral treaties. At stake is a\nlegacy to future generations of sufficient, conserved and\nrenewable resources to ensure their well-being.\nAll efforts in that direction deserve the commitment of\nthe international community as a whole, through the\nimplementation of policies of a continental or even global\nscope. The Rio Conference was merely a step on the long\nroad to convincing the world of the need to preserve the\nenvironment and to maintain the balance between the means\nof production and the human component without resorting to\ndestruction and waste.\nIt is now important to put into practice the decisions of\nthe Rio Conference in order to give expression to the\nmeasures decided on there. Portugal will not fail to do its\npart, in the full realization that only then shall we be able to\nbuild a future for coming generations.\nAt this point in its history, the United Nations is facing\nan unprecedented opportunity and, for the first time, can\nplay the role originally intended for it, without restriction, in\nthe resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of\ninternational stability and as the custodian of respect for\nhuman rights.\nWe are all committed to providing a positive\ncontribution to meeting this challenge. Portugal, for its part,\nwill do everything possible to achieve these ambitious goals.\n"

        "file_text": "Before I begin my statement, I should like to offer\nmy condolences to the Government and people of India on\nthe natural disaster that has just struck them. I should like\nto assure them, on behalf of the people of Burkina Faso, that\nwe grieve most profoundly with them.\nI wish, at the outset, to congratulate Mr. Insanally on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session and to wish him every success in the\ndischarge of the important responsibilities thus made\nincumbent upon him.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for the dedication with which\nhe presided over the work of the Assembly at its fortyseventh session.\nI wish also to take advantage of this opportunity to\nwelcome the new States that have joined our Organization.\nWe look forward to their active participation in the work of\nthe Assembly so that we might, together, strive to preserve\nthe peace, bring development to our peoples and ensure\njustice among nations.\nMay I also convey to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the most sincere congratulations\nand encouragement of the Government of Burkina Faso in\nrespect of his tireless efforts day after day to safeguard\npeace throughout the world and also to revitalize the United\nNations system.\nWhile the ideals enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter remain as valid as they were on the very first day,\nthe international community continues to suffer the\naftershocks of East-West confrontation. What I said at the\nforty-seventh session remains true:\n\\\"The collapse of one of the two blocs did not solve the\nworld\u2019s problems. Rather, it emphasized the NorthSouth split; old wounds that are still open; internal\ncontradictions within regions; and divisions among\nnations.\\\" (A/47/PV.21, p. 86)\nIn Africa, prospects run from an anxious outlook in\nsome cases to measured hope in others. In this connection,\nacting on his own convictions as well as on those of Burkina\nFaso as a whole as to the needed and indeed indispensable\nintegration of our continent, President Blaise Compaore has\nbecome active in subregional mediation and is thus making\nour contribution to the realization of this grand design for\nAfrica.\nIn Angola, the process sponsored by the United Nations\nand the international community as a whole is now being\ntorpedoed by UNITA and Mr. Jonas Savimbi, with their\nrefusal to accept the outcome of the elections. The suffering\nof the Angolan people has been exacerbated, and this today\nis the part of the world where, more than anywhere else,\npeople are dying as a result of civil war. Having learned\nfrom the experience of Angola, the Security Council has\nissued useful, indeed necessary, recommendations for\nMozambique. RENAMO is somewhat slow in implementing\nthese measures. We invite them to pursue the path of\nnegotiations, to overcome the reluctance shown, and to move\nresolutely with the Government of Mozambique towards\nreconciliation and reconstruction.\nIn Somalia, after an encouraging start, United Nations\naction is running into obstacles that are having an adverse\neffect on the very nature of the peace-keeping operation.\nWe are still convinced that while firmness is necessary,\ndialogue and negotiation with all parties are equally\nnecessary.\nIn South Africa, acts of violence continue. Each week\nthe macabre death toll is mounting as a result of attacks on\npublic transportation. This is not a climate conducive to\nsignificant, indeed decisive, elections. However, the will for\nchange which guides the majority of the protagonists in the\ntragedy that is apartheid in its death throes must prevail over\nall manner of extremism. In view of this, Burkina Faso\nhails the statement made by the President of the African\nNational Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the Special\nCommittee against Apartheid on 24 September 1993.\nAs for Rwanda, Liberia and Western Sahara, Burkina\nFaso hopes the agreements achieved can indeed be\nimplemented so that the people of these regions may at long\nlast know peace.\nThe eruption of crises of ethnic, religious or other\norigin is continuing, while the conflict in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina goes on and on, in contempt of international\nlaw and of the Security Council. We must therefore\nwelcome the fact that in Cambodia and in El Salvador the\nprocess set in train has led to a beginning of normalization,\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 35\nand we must encourage Kuwait and Iraq to abide by\nSecurity Council resolution 833 (1993).\nWhile in political terms the picture is mixed, in\neconomic terms it is bleaker. The world economy is in\nrecession. Weighed down by its debt, by the fall in raw\nmaterial prices, by the deterioration in its terms of trade and\nby natural disasters, fluctuations in climate, desertification\nand drought, Africa is staggering from one calamity to the\nnext. Structural adjustment programmes have been\nsqueezing even harder a continent that has been relegated to\nthe sidelines notwithstanding its resources and the sacrifices\nit has been making. The problems are known, and to\nrehearse them here now would sound like a litany and sterile\nrepetition. The solutions, too, are known. In this respect,\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\nhas yet to be implemented.\nA year after the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the commitments and the promises made have\nstill to take tangible form. However, the same minority\ncontinues to lay waste the planet\u2019s natural resources, while\npoverty is increasing and putting down roots in regions\nwhere it used to occur only from time to time or was only\na localized phenomenon.\nThe global village is no longer just a slogan; it has\nbecome a living reality that at the same time affects the\nconcept of security. New laws are surfacing everywhere in\nan effort to stem a new deluge, immigration. These\nmeasures are an illusion and will remain so long as people\ndo not realize, or refuse to realize, that the root of the\nproblem lies in the socio-economic inequalities that afflict\nthe world.\nIn addition, population growth will cause unbearable\npressure if real development policies are not put in place\nnow. The tragedy lies more in the concentration of\nresources for a minority than in their scarcity. A community\nthat is aware of its shortcomings and blind spots can still\nheal itself if it has the will to find and to take the necessary\nmedicine.\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\nnegotiations - the Uruguay Round - must be concluded as\nquickly as possible and must take into account the needs of\nthe developing countries.\nOnce again, it is the concept of security that has led to\nthe monstrous stockpiles of weapons of destruction. Nuclear\nweapons are the crowning achievement of this march\ntowards the abyss. To limit the risks, a Non-Proliferation\nTreaty was opened for signature, and almost all States have\nbeen invited to sign and ratify it. This is a praiseworthy\ninitiative, but it is not enough. For the Non-Proliferation\nTreaty to have any meaning, in due course the nuclearweapon States must give them up, and we must see our\nplanet totally and genuinely freed from the nuclear threat.\nThe preservation of the species and of the planet is\nthreatened in two ways: the nuclear menace and the harm\nwe are doing to the environment.\nBurkina Faso is participating actively in the work of the\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the elaboration\nof an international convention to combat desertification and\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development.\nIt is interesting to note that the harm being done to the\nenvironment in the southern hemisphere comes more from\nthe effort to survive than from the unbridled desire to\nconsume at all costs. The relationship established between\ndevelopment and environment also establishes the\nrelationship between respect for human rights and\ndevelopment. One of the great truths brought out and\naccepted at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in\nVienna, is that there is a right to development. We cannot\ntalk about human rights if elementary human rights - the\nmost elementary human rights - are compromised by\neconomic, financial and trade policies and strategies to\nwhich some people fall victim. To commit oneself to human\nrights nowadays is to commit oneself to changing the world\neverywhere and to accepting in every individual the person\nthat we want to be and to defend. It is humankind as a\nwhole that we must defend, or nothing; any other approach\nmeans giving in to harmful and questionable divisions\nbetween people.\nIn the same context, the twin scourges of AIDS and\ndrug abuse must be fought on all fronts, using all available\nresources. From 8 to 13 February this year Burkina Faso\nheld a series of national seminars on drugs, in which we\nreaffirmed the need to provide help and support for the most\ndisadvantaged countries in order to curb this threat.\nWe have deadlines in 1994 and 1995, and must prepare\nwith hard work and dedication to confront then the problems\nof population at the Cairo World Conference; to promote\nwomen\u2019s rights at the conference in Beijing; and, in\nCopenhagen, to focus on and respond to the need for social\ndevelopment.\nThe problems I have enumerated require constant\ncooperation from everybody. As we leave the cold war\nbehind, we have no better instrument for cooperation than\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe United Nations. However, the United Nations is in a\nworrying state because its finances are in a bad way, and\nthat is because some of the largest contributors have not\nfulfilled their obligations. It is therefore difficult to talk\nabout reforming, restructuring and revitalizing the\nOrganization when the primary task has not been\naccomplished. This is the first problem, because it is the\nmost urgent.\nThe second problem has to do with the chaotic situation\nin the world. This situation is giving rise to peace-keeping\noperations, and their frequency and diversity have had an\neffect - and in future will have an even greater effect - on\nthe functioning of the Organization. We approve of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s pointing to preventive diplomacy as one\nof the solutions. In this respect, at the last summit meeting\nof the Organization of African Unity, in Cairo in June 1993,\nAfrica set up a conflict prevention, management and\nsettlement mechanism.\nThe third problem arises from the Organization\u2019s\nstructural inadequacy to respond to the nature of the\nproblems it will encounter from now on. Here again, though\nwe need imagination to open up new approaches and apply\nfresh solutions to old and new problems, we must not lose\nsight of the fact that everyone must participate in the\nproposed solutions.\nThe fourth problem stems from the notion of\ndemocracy. It has been repeatedly proclaimed to be a cureall, but it cannot remain just a battle standard that we wave\nin front of the new troops who have just been won over to\nthe cause. Democracy must be transformed into a means of\naction for achieving better things, for achieving more.\nWhether within States or between States, democracy is a\nplant that does not stop growing once it has started.\nThus we come to the question of how a body with\nlimits can function for and on behalf of all. For the\nmoment, other considerations apply to the Security Council,\nbecause it is the direct inheritor of the balance of power that\narose out of the Second World War. Forty-eight years later,\nthe debate can certainly be opened. However, as Burkina\nFaso said during the forty-seventh session,\n\\\"Clearly, the role and composition of the Security\nCouncil must be reviewed. But we fear that the\ndiscussion might be limited to merely expanding a club\nwhose members would continue to view their status as\na privilege, not a weighty responsibility. The spirit and\nperhaps even the nature of the Council must be\nchanged. Clearly, we must begin the debate on the\nSecurity Council even if we are still bound by the\nterms of Article 108 of the Charter. The\ndemocratization of international relations is necessary.\\\"\n(A/47/PV.21, p. 87)\nIt was in this political, economic, social and\ninternational environment that we heard the news on\n13 September 1993 that two brothers, who had sprung from\nthe same land but had until now refused to recognize each\nother, had met. Burkina Faso hails their mutual recognition.\nIt is up to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders and peoples\nwhether this is the useful and welcome prelude to their\ntaking a long and complex path, accompanied by the\ninternational community, offering its best wishes and its\ngood offices.\nThis hope is like a guttering flame that must be kept\nburning; it is the image of our human condition, which we\nmust constantly watch over. Only together can we succeed\nin doing so.\n"

        "file_text": "It has been four years since the end of the\ncold war and the fall of the old ideological order. Four\nyears ago we were told that war and global confrontation\nhad ended and that history itself had come to an end, giving\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nway to a new age. Today, yesterday\u2019s hopes and illusions\nare confronted by a reality with which we are all familiar.\nWhat is keeping us from turning our world into a fertile\nfield and a common abode for all human beings?\nThese meetings are taking place at a time when a\nfeeling of hope animates the hearts of men. The agreements\nsigned between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization have shown that peace is possible and that\nliving in harmony does not require portentous events, but\nonly awareness and willingness. We all know that these first\nagreements, if respected by both parties, can lead to a new\ndawn not only for Israel and Palestine but for all the\ncountries of the Middle East - a new awakening of peace\nand prosperity in which this sublime teaching of the Koran\ncan be made real:\n\\\"Those who believe (in the Qur-an),\nAnd those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),\nAnd the Christians and the Sabians,-\nAny who believe in God\nAnd the Last Day,\nAnd work righteousness,\nShall have their reward\nWith their Lord: on them\nShall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.\\\" (Surah II, 62)\nBut while Israelis and Palestinians are shaking hands\nand demonstrating their good judgement, the tragedy of\nBosnia and Herzegovina continues to fill the world with\nshame. A Member State of the United Nations which is not\nexpressing ethnic or religious intolerance is trying to survive\nthe bloodiest harassment witnessed by Europe since 1945 -\nnations respond with passivity and indifference. It is\nshameful that an international community rejoicing at the\nend of the cold war has not been able to take more decisive\nand effective action in respect to the inhuman aggression\nagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nDecade after decade, the echoes of that cold war were\nheard in this Hall. The East-West confrontation was viewed\nas the supreme obstacle facing the countries of the world in\nattempting to respond to their peoples\u2019s common yearning\nfor liberty, justice and development. The ideological\ndivision, we were told, hampered the efforts made to ensure\nthat all humanity benefited from development.\nToday we no longer talk about the cold war, nor about\nideological conflict, nor about the balance of terror.\nNevertheless, the reality of what happened during those\nyears continues to brand us. Some walls have come down\nbut still others have been built. The peoples of Asia, Africa\nand Latin America remain forgotten, marginalized, second-\nclass human beings. The technological gap has become an\nabyss. Material progress is increasingly remote from our\ncountries, and cooperation is decreasing before our very\neyes. The North-South dialogue has once again been\nreduced to an implacable monologue or, in the best of cases,\na rhetorical exercise to which justice and equity are rarely\ninvited. And when we speak of new initiatives for\ncooperation, such as those recently announced for the people\nof Palestine, thought is given not to a global increase in aid\nbut, rather, to cutbacks in other programmes. As an old and\ngraphic Spanish proverb puts it: \\\"You undress one saint so\nthat you can dress another \\\".\nWhat does the new peace mean for the countries of the\nthird world? The assurance that their children will not be\nkilled by bullets, but will continue to die of hunger or\nendemic diseases? The certainty that they will no longer\nhave to go to war, but will continue without schooling,\nwithout a dignified life, decent jobs or proper medical care?\nSometimes ironic statements are made about the\noptimism of the diplomacy of the 1920s, with its agreements\nto renounce war and its naive faith in the capacity of the\nLeague of Nations to resolve every difficulty. We all know\nwhat happened in the end to optimism and that League, but\nit seems that we have not really learned the lesson. If the\ninternational community of the 1990s does not translate the\nend of the cold war into a true effort to build one world, in\nwhich there are no first- or second-rate countries, we shall\nvery soon experience realities more tragic than those we\nhave already known.\nMy country was overjoyed at the General Assembly\u2019s\ndecision to choose you, Sir, to preside over the forty-eighth\nsession. You have the most sincere congratulations of Costa\nRica, a country that, like Guyana, forms part of the great\nCaribbean brotherhood. We are certain that, under your\nguidance, the General Assembly will be able to fulfil\nmankind\u2019s hopes for peace and development.\nWe should like to express our sympathy to the\nGovernment and people of India at this time of grief for\nthem.\nThe present situation is especially critical for the\nCentral American and Caribbean States, which, because of\ntheir territorial dimensions, demographic situations and weak\neconomies, are of little significance to the developed world.\nWhen the small, peripheral nations like ours try to unite our\nefforts, we are immediately faced with the locked doors of\nthe international financial organizations, the large economic\nblocs and the transnational corporations, which even try to\ncreate apprehension and confrontation among us.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 9\nWe are not asking for handouts. Begging is not part of\na realistic and wide-reaching international policy. What our\ncountries need is greater understanding of our realities,\ngreater openness for our products, and more sincere and\neffective support for our desire to live in peace and\ndemocracy. What developing nations need is a change in\nattitude originating from a sense of the inalienable identity\nof humankind, a change in that amazing effrontery shown by\nthe developed world for our tragedies.\nThe case of Central America clearly demonstrates the\ndirection in which this widespread indifference is taking us.\nIt is taking us into a prolonged and difficult effort, in which\nthe international community is providing wide support. The\npeople of Central America left behind many years of bloody\nconvulsions. They decided to embark with enthusiasm on a\nnew life, cemented in peace, democracy and freedom. But\nthat joyful Central America, reborn for its children, has seen\nhow the doors close one after another. Those who were\ninterested in a Central America full of bloodshed and\ntrenches do not want to deal with a Central America of the\npoor, the Central America that calls for cooperation for\ndevelopment, for understanding of its human and economic\ntragedies.\nFigures can be deceiving. For example, it is said that\nNicaragua receives $500 million in foreign aid. That sounds\nvery good. What is not stated is that $450 million of the\n$500 million goes back to where it came from to service the\nexternal debt. In the meantime in that sister country even\nmore disturbing outbreaks of violence flourish, reflecting its\ndistressing situation. Recently an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in\nGuatemala failed, but that failure did not translate into\ngreater external support for the consolidation of Guatemalan\ndemocracy in the sectors most needed.\nWe do not know in which Central American country\nthe next crisis will come, but it will not be long before it\nhappens. It is regrettable that those who said so much about\ndemocracy and freedom and about peace and development\nin Central America are no longer being heard from. Today\nmy delegation asks where is that support. What of the\npromises, the golden offerings, the abundant talk of a few\nyears ago?\nFor example, let us take the case of banana production.\nThroughout the bloody crisis in Central America the\nEuropean Community time and time again expressed its\nsupport for a peaceful and negotiated solution. It effusively\nsupported the initiatives to transform Central America into\na land of freedom and democracy, to keep our countries\naway from the strategic interests of the large hegemonistic\nblocs. Now that results have been achieved, the same\nEurope is placing strong barriers to the entry of Central\nAmerican bananas to its markets, without stopping to think\nabout the thousands of humble families that depend on this\nactivity. Other Latin American democracies are facing the\nsame attitude. As if that was not enough they are trying to\nprovoke a conflict between the banana-growing countries of\nthe Caribbean and those of Latin America, as if, following\nthe custom of colonial times and invoking a non-existent\nantagonism between brothers, promoting divisions to hide\nthe barriers that in other cases they themselves denounce as\nunjust.\nCosta Rica believes that the time has come for frank,\nopen dialogue that will permit a fair and adequate solution\nto this serious problem. For this reason we invite the\nmember countries of the European Community and the\nproducer countries of Latin America and the Caribbean,\nwithout exception, to enter into political talks which,\ntogether with the talks already under way at the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), will facilitate a\nrapprochement between the positions of the only two parties\nto the problem, namely the producer and consumer countries.\nThese contacts should have as a basis the recognition of the\nrights of the Latin American countries to sell their fruit in\nthe Common Market and the reaffirmation of preferential\ntreatment given to the Caribbean countries in the context of\nthe Lom\u00e9 Conventions.\nWhile democracy endeavours to put down roots in\nCentral America, markets for Central American products are\nbeing restricted by developed countries, cooperation\nprogrammes are being decreased or canceled, and attitudes\nof inexplicable severity are being adopted in commercial and\nfinancial negotiations, and even in diplomatic relations. The\nCentral America of peace and freedom is being dealt with in\na way that the Central America of violence was never\ntreated.\nMy country, which for many decades has not suffered\nfrom the Calvary of dictatorship and civil war, which has\nmaintained intact its tradition of effective respect for human\nrights, has also had to face the same attitudes of indifference\nand lack of awareness. In this matter we draw attention to\nthe disturbing decision of the United States Government to\nadmit an administrative action brought before it against\nCosta Rica in which it is argued that the Costa Rican\nworkers are not being guaranteed internationally recognized\nrights. This claim ignores our labour legislation which deals\nwith rights and guarantees for workers and has gone further\nin more than 50 years than those of many developed\ncountries, including the United States. The threat of\nexcluding Costa Rica from commercial preference systems\nis not only a clear interference in its internal jurisdiction but\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nalso ignores the basic principles governing coexistence\namong nations, and, more specifically, respect for sovereign\nrights, and that attitude is at variance with traditional\ndemocratic principles and values which have always existed\nbetween both peoples and Governments.\nThe task of consolidating the achievements of the\nCentral American peace process is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\nIn the first place, as a new political commitment, the\nsecuring of peace and democracy and making human\ndevelopment a priority require a true national consensus\nsustained by a broad and participatory commitment, one that\ninvolves Governments and the organized sectors of civil\nsociety.\nSecondly, a renewed and creative attitude on the part of\nCentral American Governments is needed, an attitude that\nwill rework and update the regional political agreements and,\nfrom a new point of view, will direct regional efforts\ntowards creating a new Central America. We want a Central\nAmerica where peace, freedom, democracy and development\nwill prevail and this requires national and regional consensus\non fundamental subjects such as enforcing the rule of law,\nstrengthening democratic institutions, developing a\ndemocratic political culture, promoting and enforcing human\nrights, economic and political decentralization, decision-\nmaking at the local level, the modernization of production,\nguaranteeing equality of opportunity, widening the\npossibilities for economic participation, social development,\nand, finally, preserving our heritage for the society of the future.\nThirdly, the collaboration and commitment of Central\nAmericans in the creation of this new Central America is\nnecessary, but at the same time the participation of the\ninternational community is indispensable in order to fulfil the\ncommitments made by the region in its transition to peace,\nfreedom, democracy and development. In this perspective\nCosta Rica urges the General Assembly to decide in due\ncourse to offer its political and material support to this new\nchallenge that is Central America at the end of this century.\nIn the present state of affairs the role of international\nand regional organizations as promoters and guarantors of\npeace and supporters of harmony and cooperation among the\nnations of the world is particularly decisive. For many long\nyears lamentations were heard about the problems created\nfor the United Nations by ideological conflicts which\nhindered the Organization and made it impossible for it to\nact dynamically and effectively. We have left such sombre\nhours behind and without doubt there have been important\nsigns that this and other international organizations can and\nmust provide many valuable and decisive contributions to the\ninternational community as a whole. Precisely for this\nreason we find ourselves at a key moment and we must now\nredefine and transform the United Nations and the regional\norganizations and make them vital mechanisms so that a life\nof peace, freedom and development will illuminate all the\ncountries of the world.\nA little more than a year ago the Secretary-General\npresented us with a series of important ideas regarding the\nrestructuring of the United Nations. My country has\nexpressed support for these wise proposals but at the same\ntime we consider that the present circumstances are\nespecially important and that this is an opportunity to\nmeditate profoundly on the appropriateness of emphasizing\nmore the role that international organizations should play as\nbuilders of a world of peace and development for all\npeoples.\nMy country considers that the United Nations cannot\ncontinue to ignore the question of the Republic of China in\nTaiwan. The existence of that exemplary country and the\nfuture of its 21 million inhabitants demand a revision of its\nrelations with the United Nations. We firmly support the\nestablishment of an ad hoc committee to study and find\nsatisfactory solution to that problem in accordance with the\nfundamental principles of international law.\nFor many years we have urged that the two important\ninstruments of the United Nations system be created and\nstart functioning. These two instruments - so indispensable\nto the attainment of that system\u2019s aims of peace and defence\nof fundamental human rights - are the University for Peace\nand the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights. We\nask for support for both institutions, which are true pillars\nfor the realization of the principles of the Charter.\nMy delegation applauds the efforts made by the United\nNations in situations like those that exist in Haiti and\nSomalia. The defence of international peace and security\ncontinues to be a basic responsibility. We therefore support\nall efforts accepted in the cause of disarmament and arms\ncontrol, and we view with special concern the case of\ncountries that, like the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea, object to controls that are directed towards ensuring\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear arms. At the same time,\nhowever, Costa Rica considers it of fundamental importance\nthat States Members of the United Nations not lose sight of\nthe Organization\u2019s role in the task of making peace productive -\na \\\"sublime task\\\", to borrow the term used by Amilcar\nCabral to define the progressive advancement of mankind\ntowards dignity and infinite growth.\nThe world is one. Our shared concerns for peace and\nthe deterioration of the environment are an ample\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 11\ndemonstration of this. Why not also acknowledge that\nmankind is one and that all who form part of mankind have\na right to development and freedom?\nThe commitments undertaken last year in Rio de\nJaneiro at the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development to join in the search for sustainable\ndevelopment, in all its economic and environmental as well\nas its political, social and cultural dimensions, constitute a\nfundamental requirement if we are to achieve true peace and\na dignified life for all the peoples of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s\nworld. The convening of the Conference and the agreements\nreached there, notwithstanding their limitations, are major\nachievements for the Organization. In this connection, the\nfact that many countries, including my own, have engaged\nin activities to carry out the commitments entered into there\nis of great importance. We also welcome the actions taken\nby the United Nations at the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development, the World Conference on\nWomen, and the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, aimed at\nbroadening discussions about the hoped-for development.\nBut if those efforts are to be successful, it is indispensable\nthat the promises made by the industrialized countries at the\nRio Summit be fulfilled - that is, that they provide new and\nadditional financial aid, something they have so far done on\na fairly meagre scale.\nFor nearly half a century, we have been living amid\ndivision, struggles about ideologies, worries over\nhegemonies. To a large extent, those sterile years are now\nbehind us, but so much remains to be done. We are still\nconfronted by hatreds of all kinds, by a polluted world, by\nnatural disasters, by illiteracy and by peoples suffering from\nhunger and disease. However, if the international system\nmanaged to avoid allowing the cold war to lead to military\ncatastrophe, surely it can find solutions to these other\ncatastrophes that are afflicting mankind. If we do not want\nthe military and ideological alliances of past years to re-\nemerge, we must replace them as soon as possible with a\nsolidarity that is not founded on economic interests. My\ndelegation firmly believes that the Organization can and\nmust effect, as a priority, the qualitative transformation\nrequired by the international community - that is, the\ncreation of a great family, without East or West, North or\nSouth. Brothers and sisters know nothing of the points of\nthe compass.\nIn his book entitled Things Fall Apart Chinua Achebe\ntells of a community in Nigeria where the harvest was poor.\nAttempting to encourage a young man, his father tells him:\n\\\"Do not be disheartened. I know you will not be\ndisheartened. You have a brave and dignified heart. A\ndignified heart can survive a serious problem because the\nproblem does not impinge upon his dignity. But it is more\ndifficult and more bitter when you face it alone.\\\"\nHope resides in solidarity and in union. Mankind is\none. All the peoples of the world must understand that we\nshare the same future, that there are no longer problems that\naffect only others or differing destinies for mankind.\nWorking together with goodwill and in one spirit, we\nwill be able to transform our world into a common home,\ninto a fertile ground for the promotion of and respect for the\ndignity of all human beings, joined to face a common future\nof peace, justice and freedom.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset I should like warmly to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the current\nsession of the General Assembly. I am convinced that given\nyour proven talent and extensive experience, and with the\ncooperation of all delegations, you will steer our session to\nfull success. I also wish to express my sincere thanks to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his remarkable\naccomplishments during the last session. I would like to\ntake this opportunity to extend a warm welcome and\ncongratulations to the new Members which have been\nadmitted to the United Nations this year.\nThe world has moved into a transitional period towards\nmultipolarity since the disintegration of the bipolar structure.\nIt had been hoped that the end of the cold war would bring\npeace and prosperity to the world. Indeed, the prospects of\navoiding another world war and ensuring a lasting peace\nhave improved. However, contradictions that had lain\ndormant during the cold war have begun to emerge, and\nmanifestations of hegemonism and power politics in\ninternational relations are on the rise. Peace and development, so ardently aspired to by mankind, still face grave\nchallenges.\nThe relative stability Europe once enjoyed has been\nupset. Many countries are plagued by severe economic\nslumps or by political upheaval. Some regions are torn by\nethnic or religious feuds exacerbated by territorial disputes,\nleading to intermittent conflicts and armed clashes. A\nregional war is raging at the southern end of the Eurasian\nland mass. All this can only have a negative impact on\nEurope and on the world at large.\nIn the meantime, a number of developed countries have\ndeveloped a \\\"post-cold-war syndrome\\\". Some have sunk\ninto the longest recession since the Second World War. In\nthe new setting, internal contradictions have sharpened,\npolitical scandals are rife, racism has reared its ugly head,\ntrade protectionism is on the rise, and xenophobic violence\nis spreading. Public disaffection has been manifest, and the\nentrenched political establishment has been shaken. This\ntrend has adversely affected the stability of the countries\nconcerned and complicated international relations.\nThe new international environment has led to an even\nmore dire plight for many developing countries. Increasing\nforeign intervention has heightened various internal factors\nof instability, thus compounding their difficulties. Their\nrights to independence, subsistence and development have\nbeen neither duly respected nor safeguarded. Therefore,\ninterference from the outside should cease, and the\ninternational community should give top priority to helping\nthose countries achieve political stability and overcome\neconomic difficulties. Lasting world peace and stability will\nremain elusive if the developing countries are still beset by\npersistent political unrest and if the North-South gap\ncontinues to widen.\nThere is no denying the fact that peace and\ndevelopment remain the overriding issues of our time. To\npreserve peace and accelerate development has become the\npressing demand of the people of all countries, but especially\nof those in the developing countries.\nThe world we live in is as diversified as ever. There\nare now more than 180 independent sovereign States, which\ndiffer not only in social systems but also in stages of\ndevelopment. Moreover, they have widely diverse\nideologies, cultural traditions, ethnic identities and religious\nfaiths. We should recognize and respect those differences\nand diversities, and treat each other as equal members of the\ninternational community. We should promote interchanges\nin the spirit of seeking common ground while setting aside\ndifferences. We should oppose any attempt to impose a\nparticular model on large numbers of countries, as diverse as\nthey are.\nWe believe that there can be genuine peace,\ninternational harmony and common development among\nStates only when international relations strictly conform to\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nand are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\nand other accepted norms of international conduct.\nIncreased economic and cultural interchanges between States\nhave deepened their interdependence. It is absolutely\nnecessary that States open up to each other; enhance\nexchanges, mutual understanding and cooperation; and share\nthe benefit of complementarity. But all this will be possible\nonly on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual\nbenefit.\nIn order to attain the overall objective of peace and\ndevelopment, the Chinese Government has on many\noccasions called for the establishment of a new international\npolitical and economic order of peace, stability, justice and\nrationality based on the Five Principles of Peaceful\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19\nCoexistence and on the recognition of the diversity of the\nworld and of the differences among States. Under the new\norder, mutual respect and cooperation between States on an\nequal footing will replace hegemonism and power politics;\npeace talks, dialogue and consultations will replace the use\nor threat of force; and equality, mutual benefit and\naccommodation of each other\u2019s needs will replace trade\nprotectionism and unequal exchanges. The Chinese\nGovernment is ready to cooperate extensively with all other\ncountries and will continue to make unremitting efforts for\nthe establishment of such a new order, and for peace and\ndevelopment of the world.\nThe report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277)\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General contains many important,\nthought-provokinq recommendations and ideas that deserve\ncareful consideration. We commend the Secretary-General\nfor his efforts therein. As a permanent member of the\nSecurity Council, China has always supported the positive\nendeavours of the United Nations in preserving world peace\nand stability, promoting global development and resolving\ninternational disputes. We support the further enhancement\nand strengthening of the United Nations constructive role in\npreventive diplomacy, in peacemaking and peace-keeping on\nthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nAs the frequency and scope of United Nations\npeace-keeping operations is growing, we deem it important\nand relevant to stress such basic principles of the Charter as\nrespect for the sovereignty of, and non-interference in, the\ninternal affairs of Member States. Those principles must be\nstrictly observed at all times when undertaking preventive\ndiplomacy, peace-keeping operations or post-conflict\npeace-building. Prior consent and pledges of cooperation by\nthe parties must be obtained, and strict impartiality should\nprevail in all peace-keeping missions. Only in this way can\nUnited Nations preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping\noperations fulfil the underlying purposes of the Charter and\nachieve the desired positive result.\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes is an\nimportant principle of the Charter, one which we deem to be\nthe essence of preventive diplomacy. Everything should be\ndone to bring the opposing parties to the negotiating table\nbefore the outbreak of conflicts, so that they can start\nconsultations to achieve a peaceful settlement. All disputes\nbetween States, regional conflicts or even internal conflicts,\nhowever complex they may be, should be amenable to a\npolitical solution, and nothing should be done to aggravate\nthe situation.\nNot long ago, the Palestine Liberation Organization and\nthe Government of Israel signed an agreement on mutual\nrecognition and on the question of self-government for\nPalestinians. Although just a beginning, the move was a\nmajor breakthrough in the settlement of the Middle East\nquestion, which has dragged on for nearly half a century.\nThis agreement was the result of efforts by the international\ncommunity and by both Palestine and Israel to settle an\ninternational dispute by peaceful means. We sincerely\nwelcome and wish to express our congratulations at this\ndevelopment. We can see from this that as long as a\nglimmer of hope remains, one must not give up the pursuit\nof a peaceful settlement.\nNeedless to say, one should adopt a very serious\nattitude towards, and firmly oppose, any act of aggression\nthat tramples on the sovereignty of another country, such as\nlarger States bullying smaller ones or the strong lording it\nover the weak in the international arena. We disapprove of\nthe indiscriminate use of sanctions or force in the name of\nthe United Nations. We also believe that humanitarian\nmissions must not be transformed into military operations\nand that a war cannot be stopped by\nexpanding it.\nIt must be noted that in a world troubled by recurrent\nregional conflicts and interwoven contradictions, the United\nNations alone cannot hope to resolve all international\ndisputes. It has the duty to undertake this task and\nmaintain international peace and security. But regional\norganizations should also be taken into account and\nencouraged, as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter, to\nassume greater responsibility and play a more active role in\nthis regard. In view of the proliferation of United Nations\npeace-keeping operations and the concomitant demands on\nthe Organization and Member States in terms of manpower,\nfinance and material resources, we deem it essential that the\nUnited Nations act within the limits of its means and\nenhance the cost-effectiveness of such operations.\nPeace and development are inseparable. Economic\ndevelopment cannot get off the ground without the\nprerequisites of peace and stability. On the other hand,\nunless there is sound economic development, there can\nhardly be secure or enduring peace and stability. We\nmaintain that the United Nations should meet the demands\nof the developing countries for social and economic\nadvancement and should give this very high priority. This\nis the way to make the United Nations an Organization that\nall the countries of the world will support and count on.\nThis is also the way to enhance further the role and prestige\nof the United Nations. Proceeding from this consideration,\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwe in China have stepped up preparations for the fourth\nWorld Conference on Women in Beijing, scheduled for\n1995. We also give vigorous support to the convening of\nthe World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen\nthe same year.\nIt must be pointed out that unless the international\ncommunity helps the developing countries break loose\nquickly from poverty and backwardness, there can be no\nsustained growth or prosperity for all. Hence, we call upon\nthe developed countries to do more to curb trade\nprotectionism, contribute more funds for development and\nenvironmental protection, cut back debt burden, increase\nofficial development assistance, reduce restrictions on\ntechnology transfer and open their markets wider so as to\ncreate a favourable environment for the economic recovery\nand revitalization of the developing countries. This will\nprove a boon to the developed countries themselves. At a\ntime when the world economy has become increasingly\ninterrelated, the revitalization of the developing countries\nwill be a boost to the world and will spur to the economic\nrecovery and growth of the developed countries.\nSince the founding of the United Nations, tremendous\nchanges have taken place in the world and in the\nOrganization itself. United Nations membership has\nincreased from the original 51 to 184 now, the majority\nbeing developing countries. The Chinese Government is of\nthe view that, in keeping with developments, the United\nNations should be restructured, and the composition of the\nSecurity Council could be appropriately enlarged to enable\nthe Organization better to respond to the changes in the\nworld, meet the concerns and wishes of the membership and\nenhance its own role in international affairs. Reform of the\nSecurity Council should enable it better to discharge its\nmandate in accordance with the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter. It is the collective will and common aspiration\nof the membership that in the new circumstances the United\nNations should be better equipped to address major\ninternational issues vigorously and effectively and in a fair\nand balanced manner. Therefore, the reform of the Security\nCouncil and other United Nations organs should take due\naccount of the principle of equitable geographical\ndistribution and should accommodate the interests of the\ndeveloping countries which make up the overwhelming\nmajority of the membership. Since any reform would affect\nthe interests of all Member States and involve a revision of\nthe Charter, views from all quarters must be heard. The\nreform plan should undergo extensive discussions and\nconsultations by the membership and should be generally\nacceptable to all.\nThe Chinese Government has stated on many occasions\nthat China stands for the non-proliferation of all weapons of\nmass destruction. At the same time we hold that the\nultimate objective of mankind should be the complete\nprohibition and thorough destruction of those weapons. Now\nthat the Conventions banning biological and chemical\nweapons have been concluded, we deem it high time that the\ncomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear\nweapons were put on the agenda.\nThe international community has expressed concern\nover the issue of a nuclear-test ban. The Chinese\nGovernment has always stood for a total test ban within the\nframework of the complete prohibition and thorough\ndestruction of nuclear weapons. We support an early start\nto negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty\nand will work in common with other countries towards a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban at an early date.\nChina has always exercised great restraint in nuclear\ntesting. The number of our tests is the smallest among all\nnuclear Powers. While a nuclear test ban is necessary, to\nundertake not to use nuclear weapons at all is far more\ncrucial, because this will not only make their testing,\ndevelopment, production or deployment devoid of any\nmeaning, but will give great impetus to nuclear disarmament,\nwhich will contribute tremendously to world peace and\nsecurity. If, however, complete prohibition and thorough\ndestruction of nuclear weapons cannot be achieved soon\nenough, then let the nuclear Powers reach an agreement not\nto be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use them\nagainst non-nuclear-weapon States or nuclear-free zones.\nThis is entirely feasible and should be done as soon as\npossible. This will put nuclear Powers to the test to see\nwhether they are genuinely willing to treat non-nuclearweapon States as equals. China long ago unilaterally undertook not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time\nor under any circumstances, and not to use or threaten to use\nthem against any nuclear-free zone or non-nuclear-weapon\nState. We call upon all the other nuclear Powers to make\nthe same pledge and conclude an international convention to\nthis effect as soon as possible.\nNow there are international arrangements and\nconventions that are designed to control arms transfers and\nban certain types of weapons of mass destruction. Such\nconventions are aimed at maintaining international and\nregional peace, security and stability. The arrangements\ndesigned to control transfers of missile technology should\nalso take into account such elements as the arbitrary use of\nmissiles for attacks on other countries. Otherwise, such an\narrangement will become a means by which certain Powers\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21\ncan maintain military superiority or play power politics. That\nis morally unjustifiable. We oppose the all-too-frequent\narbitrary use of sanctions by one country to bring pressure\nto bear on another under the pretext of controlling arms\ntransfers while engaging in massive arms sales of one\u2019s own\nwhich jeopardize the sovereignty and security of the country\nconcerned. We also denounce the hegemonic conduct of a\nself-styled \\\"world cop\\\" that tramples upon international law\nand norms of international relations by endangering another\ncountry\u2019s navigational safety and normal trading under the\npretext of enforcing the ban on chemical weapons and in\ndisregard of the provisions of the relevant international\nconventions.\nThanks to the policy of reform and opening to the\nworld, China\u2019s economy has expanded considerably over the\npast 15 years and is now in high gear. Our gross national\nproduct rose 12.8 per cent last year, and the current year\u2019s\ngrowth rate will again be in double digits. Our foreign trade\nand economic cooperation have been expanding rapidly.\nTotal trade volume in 1992 was a 5.2-fold increase over\n1978, the year before the start of the reform and opening-up,\nand represents an annual growth rate of 13.9 per cent.\nInvestments from overseas have flowed in rapidly. Nearly\n50,000 overseas-funded projects involving $58 billion were\napproved in 1992. The momentum has continued into the\ncurrent year. High-speed growth has helped basically solve\nthe problem of feeding and clothing a population of over 1.1\nbillion and put China on the road towards prosperity. It has\nalso boosted economic exchanges and cooperation with other\ncountries. This is good for both China and the world.\nBut we have encountered some problems as our\neconomy has picked up speed. These problems will be\nresolved by accelerating and deepening our reform. We\nhave taken a number of measures to strengthen\nmacro-control and readjust the economic structure to ensure\nhealthy, rapid and steady economic growth. We are fully\ncapable of attaining our objective. We are full of confidence\nin the future of our development programme.\nIt is an objective reality that China has indeed achieved\nimpressive economic success. But it does not tally with the\nfacts to exaggerate our economic strength. Given China\u2019s\nvast land area, huge population and uneven economic\ndevelopment in different parts of the country, our per capita\ngross national product is still quite low. Ours is still a\ndeveloping country. It will require several generations\nworking very hard for many decades before we can attain\nthe level of an average developed country.\nAt this juncture, I would like to draw attention to\nassertions recently bruited about on the international scene:\nthat China\u2019s economic success would entail a military\nbuild-up, or that China would move to \\\"fill up the vacuum\\\",\nthus constituting a threat, and so on and so forth. This is\nutterly groundless. A China with a burgeoning economy is\nan important factor contributing to the economic well-being\nof Asia and the world at large. The Chinese people had\nlong suffered under imperialist aggression, and it regained\nindependence only after horrible sacrifices in countless grim\nstruggles spanning more than a century. Nothing can make\nus forget the episodes of our history when our country was\nsubjected to foreign aggression, dismemberment and\nenslavement. Our ancient sage Confucius, that great thinker\nand statesman, admonished: \\\"Do not do unto others what\nyou would not like others to do unto you\\\".\nEven when China becomes more developed, we will\nnever engage in aggression or expansionism; nor will we\never seek hegemony. This is a pledge which has been\nenshrined in our Constitution and which has become part of\nour consistent and firm basic State policy. It has been borne\nout by facts that China is a staunch force for world peace\nand stability. Our limited defence capability is solely for\nself-defence purposes. Many of our military industrial plants\nhave been converted to civilian production. Our military\nexpenditures are the lowest among the major countries. We\nhave neither troops nor military bases on foreign territory.\nWe are immersed in economic construction. Therefore, we\nneed an international environment of enduring peace as well\nas long-term amicable relations with our neighbours. We are\nready to cultivate and strengthen similar relationships with\nall other countries on the basis of the five principles of\npeaceful coexistence.\nNo matter how the wind may change its direction on\nthe world scene, China will unswervingly play its part in\npreserving world peace and promoting common prosperity\nand development.\n"

        "file_text": "The direction that international relations have\ntaken today, although to some extent decided upon by States,\nreflects, none the less, the limited ability of States to bring\nthe condition of the world into line with the new\ninternational social realities. If the problems that face the\ninternational community because of this international social\ndynamic are to be resolved they must be tackled through\ncollective, concerted and appropriate action that goes beyond\nthe national framework. My country is happy that there is\namong States a growing awareness of these needs. We\nwelcome this new direction as the forty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly begins.\nBut before stating my delegation\u2019s views about how to\nencourage States to share this new approach - and as we\nwork in this direction we shall be calling on you, Sir, to\ndemonstrate your great qualities - we should like to extend\nto you the warm congratulations of the Central African\nRepublic on your election as President of the General\nAssembly. We pledge to you our full cooperation, and\nexpress the hope that your work will be crowned with\nsuccess.\nThe wisdom and spirit of compromise with which your\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, conducted the proceedings\nat the last session earned the full appreciation of my\ndelegation.\nThe renewed authority of our Organization is due, of\ncourse, to the determination of Member States but also to the\nconviction and methodical, rational and pragmatic action of\nthe Secretary-General, who has always, and in all\ncircumstances, endeavoured to work for the purposes and\nprinciples of the Organization. To\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali we pledge the renewed support\nof the Central African Republic.\nMy delegation also welcomes the admission to our\nOrganization of the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic,\nEritrea, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of\nAndorra and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\nTheir admission fulfils the oft-expressed desire of the\ninternational community to see all the countries of the world\nas Members of our Organization and thus strengthen its\nuniversal character. All States, individually and collectively,\nmust come together to defend the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations. It is unacceptable for some States still\nto be excluded.\nFor this reason, in the view of the delegation of the\nCentral African Republic, today it is important that the place\nof the Republic of China in our Organization be\nreconsidered. The immense progress made by the Republic\nof China in Taiwan in the political, economic and social\nspheres has now earned it the right to resume its place here\nso that it can contribute, better than it did in the past, to the\nflourishing of international cooperation through its active\nparticipation in the United Nations system.\nThe developments in the international arena we are\nwitnessing today arise from the process of transformation\nthat the world has undergone, especially in the last few\nyears. These transformations affect all areas of international\nlife, and, fortunately, States are taking them into account as\nthey manage their international relations, which, to a large\nextent, determine the direction our world takes. There is\nalso an emerging tendency for problems to have world-wide\neffects, prompting States to become the guardians of world\ninterests. This phenomenon is clearly illustrated in\ncooperation and concerted action among States in the spirit\nsuggested by our Secretary-General in \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\" in efforts to contribute to laying the foundation for\nreal peace in the world. Indeed, notwithstanding certain\nreflexive and automatic responses the relics of the cold-war\nconditions, States today are increasingly determined to do\nwhat they can, on the foundation of the principles of the\nUnited Nations and in cooperation with the United Nations,\nin order, if not to eliminate, at least try, to reduce prevailing\ntensions in other areas of the world.\nMy delegation is happy that this approach has now\nmade it possible for the situation to evolve as it has in\nCambodia, South Africa - where the Central African\nRepublic supports the appeal by the President of the African\nNational Congress (ANC), Mr. Nelson Mandela, to lift\nsanctions against South Africa - and, finally, in the Middle\nEast, in respect of which my country pays a hearty tribute to\nMr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin for their courage,\nvision and lucidity in signing recently the historic accord on\nmutual recognition. This same desire for cooperation is\nneeded in order to bring about a positive and speedy\nsettlement of the problems of the former Yugoslavia,\nWestern Sahara, Angola and Somalia.\nThe international gatherings recently held in Vienna and\nGeneva, while making it possible to take the measure of the\nsad reality of human-rights violations throughout the world,\nprovided at the same time an opportunity for States to\nreaffirm the need for concerted international action with a\nview to guaranteeing more securely these values. In\naddition, since the Rio Conference, States have shown\ngreater interest in the question of the environment, and they\nhave now made Agenda 21 a real platform for cooperation\nin this area, which will make it easier to ensure better\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nprotection of the common heritage of mankind while\nmaintaining conditions for sustainable development.\nThis tendency for problems to have world-wide effects,\nif systematically managed, would usher in a new era, that of\nthe triumph of multilateralism, an era in which the United\nNations would bring its authority to bear - as it is trying,\nwith varying degrees of success, to do today in certain\npeace-keeping operations - in other areas of cooperation,\nsuch as cooperation for development. Inadequacies in the\narea of cooperation are in sharp contrast to the declared\ndetermination of States to contribute to maintaining balance\nin the world in the post-cold-war period. It is, then,\ndesirable that real solidarity be cultivated among Member\nStates, which might induce developed countries to support\nefforts for development in developing countries, in particular\nin Africa.\nThe economic condition of these countries is constantly\ndeteriorating from year to year, and they have often come\nbefore this and other bodies to bring their problems to the\nattention of the international community, whose response\nhas, unfortunately, not removed any of the obstacles to those\ncountries\u2019 development. Those obstacles are, in short, the\ncontinuing decline of prices of commodities, the heavy debt\nburden and debt-servicing, negative net financial flows and\nstrengthened protectionism. If these factors persist, there is\nno doubt that the African countries will have increasing\ndifficulty in overcoming their situation. But these countries\nmust not be excluded from development, and everything\nmust be done to encourage their efforts at development.\nThe duty of solidarity calls for dialogue and cooperation\nbetween the developed countries and the developing\ncountries in order to ensure fairer remuneration for\ncommodities and an easing of the debt burden and debt-\nservicing. Coordinating efforts at the level of the United\nNations system, among international economic and financial\ninstitutions and organizations and among\nnon-governmental organizations is required to improve the\nsituation of the developing countries.\nSuch activity would be in keeping with the new spirit\nthat characterizes international relations today and that has\nmade it possible for some developed countries to support the\ndemocratization process that has begun in some of our\ncountries, including my own. I should like, in this regard,\nto express our deep gratitude to all the countries and\ninstitutions that have so kindly provided us with material and\nfinancial support and sent international observers to help the\ncause of democracy in the Central African Republic. We\nhope we shall continue to enjoy their concerned assistance\nin our endeavour to lay the foundation of our young\ndemocracy, and, from this rostrum, I wish to appeal for\nunderstanding.\nMy delegation believes that the time has come to bring\nabout genuine democratization in the decision-making bodies\nof the United Nations, the Security Council in particular, the\nmembership of which must be adapted to the new realities\nof the world.\nThe great developments in science and technology have\ntoday reduced our world to a global village where each and\nevery one of us must feel directly affected by all the\nproblems that exist on the various levels of international life.\nThe trend towards the globalization of problems that has\nbecome evident as a result of this ought to be maintained so\nthat States can take up the challenge of defending peace by\npromoting the development of human rights.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 17\nFor the Central African Republic, this challenge can be\nsuccessfully taken up if we fully respect the principles of the\nUnited Nations.\n"

Bangladesh is proud to have played a\ndefinite role in the world-wide resurgence of democracy.\nAbout two and a half years ago, we succeeded in\nestablishing a truly democratic Government following the\nelimination of the old autocratic regime, which had lasted\nabout a decade.\nDemocracy and development are mutually reinforcing.\nOur success on the road to democracy depends largely on\nour ability to tackle the challenge of alleviating poverty. We\nhave many limitations: there is a lack of capital; we lag\nbehind in technology. Handicapped by resource constraints\nas we are, it is not possible for us to undertake this difficult\ntask alone: we need the cooperation of all.\nToday, democracy is universally recognized as the best\npolitical system. Democracy aims at building a prosperous\nsociety by creating avenues for the unstinted development of\nhuman creativity and skill. If the process of development is\ndisrupted, democracy and stability are threatened. Nurturing\nthe emerging democratic spirit in the third-world countries\ncalls for sincere cooperation from the developed\nindustrialized nations.\nToday there exists a yawning gap between the\neconomies and cultures of the developed countries of the\nNorth and those of the developing countries of the South.\nBut one must realize that poverty is not the same as\nbankruptcy: the South, where Bangladesh belongs, has a\nglorious past, when there was economic and cultural\nprosperity. We are now engaged in the task of building a\nnew future based on our culture, tradition and availability of\nresources. For us, it is a matter of pride and satisfaction that\nour people\u2019s love for freedom has found concrete shape in\nthe establishment of democracy.\nWe want to emphasize human creativity and human\ncapacity to toil. The much-talked-about new concept of a\n\\\"human development index\\\" does not seem to be adequate:\nwe feel that it must capture the indigenous culture and\nvalues of differing civilizations. We believe that a new\ndimension will be added to the overall development\nframework of the less developed countries if this proposal is\naccepted.\nOur prime objective is to build a prosperous society and\neconomy by consolidating national independence,\nsovereignty, human rights and democracy. This calls for\nguaranteeing the security of small States like ours. As we\nwork on new equations in international relations, the United\nNations must take effective measures to ensure the security\nof small States. The hopes and aspirations of millions of\npeople are linked to this. We feel that in the new world\norder that is taking shape following the end of the cold war,\nmutual respect between large and small States should be the\nonly recognized norm. In order to ensure a future free from\nwar and conflict, it is imperative that we ensure the\nsovereignty of small States.\nWe believe that the international rule of law has a vital\nrole to play in ensuring the security of small and weak\nStates. The priority areas in this context are: a river-water\nconvention; the law of the sea; environmental protection; and\nthe status of refugees, economic migrants and displaced\npersons. Universal acceptance of the jurisdiction of the\nInternational Court of Justice without reservation has become\nan urgent necessity in the pursuit of peace.\nWe all live on the same planet. World civilization\ntoday and its accumulated store of knowledge is the joint\nachievement of all peoples of the world. Everyone has a\nclaim to an equal share of the world\u2019s resources and\nprosperity. The great disparity that exists in the field of\ntechnology must be removed; therefore, we want a free flow\nof technology. We feel that the exclusivity of intellectual\nproperty rights is a great hindrance, frustrating the transfer\nof technology; we call upon all concerned to refrain from\ntaking a selfish view in this regard. A similar discriminatory\nattitude is also evident with regard to the flow of\ninformation: this is contrary to the concept of a free flow of\ninformation throughout the globe. In order to establish a\nwell-balanced world community, it is imperative to ensure\nthe free flow of both information and technology.\nOur existence is inseparable from the existence of our\nplanet, and the existence of our planet is threatened today.\nThe ecological balance is being disrupted, but the blame is\nbeing conveniently shifted to the developing countries:\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 21\nunfair conditions regarding the environment are being\nimposed on them. In many ways, the industrially developed\ncountries are mainly responsible for environmental pollution.\nGiven the resource constraints of the developing countries,\ntheir capacity to pollute the environment is very\ninsignificant: they are more preoccupied with resolving their\neconomic problems. We believe that the major\nresponsibility for the prevention of environmental pollution\nlies, therefore, with the developed countries. Those\nindustrially developed countries that pollute the environment\nin catering for their peoples\u2019 demands for high living must\nbear the responsibility of mending the damage done.\nWe are acutely conscious of the need to protect the\nenvironment. We are frugal in our use of fuel, electricity\nand water resources. Bangladesh\u2019s industrial sector\ncontributes only marginally to environmental pollution. Our\njute industry and jute products are more acceptable, in\nenvironmental terms, than various chemical and synthetic\nproducts. However, in the face of the massive expansion of\nthe use of synthetic fibres that pollute the environment our\njute industry is threatened with extinction. Millions of\npeople in several countries, including Bangladesh, depend on\nthe jute industry for their living. Thus, the production of\nsynthetic fibres must be stopped, in the interests of the\nenvironment as well as of the millions who toil in the jute\nsector.\nWe call upon the donor countries and the aid\norganizations, in providing assistance, to pay due attention\nto our indigenous initiatives and development programmes.\nThe success of the development process would thus become\nalmost impossible. Unrealistic conditions create unnecessary\nobstacles in the way of the development process and the\nsmooth progress of democracy.\nIn this context, I admit that a State cannot hope to\nbecome self-reliant through external aid and assistance alone.\nWhat we really need is liberalization of trade.\nUnfortunately, however, in the field of external trade the\ndeveloping countries are being subjected to all sorts of\ndiscrimination by the developed countries. This must give\nway to strong and realistic North-South trade links based on\nequality. To this end, the immediate and satisfactory\nconclusion to the Uruguay Round of negotiations has\nbecome imperative. Together with development assistance,\nwe seek trade and investment. In Bangladesh we have\ncreated a highly congenial climate for external investment.\nContemporary experience has proved that the desired\ndevelopment cannot be achieved through dependence on\nexternal assistance alone; it is essential that trade and\ninvestment be expanded at the same time.\nWe are engaged in an earnest endeavour to achieve\neconomic prosperity by building upon our indigenous\nheritage. We are striving to forge a more productive and\nefficient workforce. We have made considerable progress in\nthe field of structural reform of the economy. Inflation is at\nits lowest level. After long years of recession, there has\nbeen a definite increase in the rate of growth in agriculture\nand industry.\nWe have also made considerable progress in the\nexpansion of education. We have launched the programme\nentitled \\\"Food for Education\\\" as a means of ensuring the\nright to education of the poorer sections of our population.\nWe aim to achieve a literacy rate of 60 per cent by the year\n2000. We have initiated a national social programme with\na view to restricting the population within a desirable level.\nOur efforts have brought us to the threshold of\nself-sufficiency in the production of food grains.\nIn consonance with current world trends, we have also\nsubscribed to a market economy. As I said earlier, in\neconomic considerations poverty is the main economic\nchallenge that we face. In tackling this challenge, we have\nadopted a new development model, whose purpose is to\nensure extensive participation by the people in the\ndevelopment process. We have adopted the \\\"Daal Bhaat\\\"\nprogramme, which envisages the provision of basic nutrition\nfor the poor and deprived masses and the development of\nhuman resources.\nWe are expanding sanitation and primary health care\nfacilities throughout the country. Special priority is being\ngiven to the integration of women in the development\nprocess. In this area, the Grameen Bank, the Rural\nDevelopment Board and the Agricultural Bank are making\na commendable contribution.\nWe must encourage regional cooperation as a\nsupplement to our efforts in multilateral cooperation.\nAgainst this backdrop, the seven countries of South Asia set\nup the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation\n(SAARC). As the current Chairperson of SAARC, I am\ntrying to intensify development cooperation between the\nmember countries. During the seventh SAARC Summit,\nwhich was held in Dhaka in April this year, we adopted\nsome specific programmes for poverty alleviation. Besides,\ninitiatives have also been taken to further promote\ncooperation in various fields, including trade, education and\nculture.\nAlong with regional cooperation, we have attached\npriority to the development and strengthening of good\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nneighbourly relations and to the resolution of outstanding\nbilateral problems with our neighbours. Unfortunately,\nhowever, some issues remain unresolved with our neighbour\nIndia, the most important one being the sharing of water.\nWe have not yet succeeded in convincing India as to what\nis our fair share of water from the rivers that flow through\nthe two countries. We share 54 rivers. Historically, and\nunder international law, we have a right - an inherent and\nlegal right - to the water resources of the common rivers.\nBut since completion of the Farakka Barrage, India has been\nunilaterally drawing Ganges water upstream. Withdrawal of\nwater during the dry season causes serious drought, while\nthe release of excess water during the rainy season produces\nsevere floods in Bangladesh. This has created unimaginable\nadverse effects on the economy and environment of\nBangladesh.\nThe pledges given by India when the Farakka Barrage\nwas commissioned remain unfulfilled. This unilateral\nwithdrawal of water, in complete disregard of the interests\nof the people of Bangladesh, has brought more than\n40 million people in the Ganges basin - or, rather, the\nPadma basin - face to face with catastrophe, with disaster.\nThe Farakka Barrage has become, for us, an issue of\nlife or death. Owing to obstruction of the natural flow at the\nBarrage, a process of desertification is evident throughout\nthe northern and western parts of Bangladesh. As a result,\nvegetation is dwindling, and, in the south, the spreading\nsalinity threatens industries and agriculture with ruin.\nIncreased siltation is reducing the navigability of rivers.\nFish and animals will soon be in danger of extinction.\nInnumerable people, in various occupations, who depended\non the river Padma for their living are becoming\nunemployed. Many are being uprooted from their homes\nand hearths.\nWhile the whole world is voicing concern about\nprotection of the environment, a large proportion of\nBangladesh\u2019s population is being pushed to the threshold of\npoverty and destruction. This is nothing but a gross\nviolation of human rights and justice. To put it simply, our\neconomic structure is faced with disaster because of the\nFarakka Barrage.\nIndia could have played an important role in\nstrengthening mutual trust between the two countries if it\nhad lived up to its pledges on the question of water sharing.\nWe feel that this is still possible. We believe that the world\ncommunity sincerely wishes to see Bangladesh succeed in its\nstruggle to dislodge the burden of poverty that has\naccumulated over the ages. But how can we, with our\nmeagre resources, ever hope to achieve that objective if\nman-made obstacles stand in our way? Bangladesh wishes,\ntherefore, to draw the attention of the world community to\nthis issue, in the interest of establishing human rights,\nprotecting the right to natural resources and ensuring the\nprocess of development. Something must be done urgently\nto end this inhuman treatment of the people of Bangladesh.\nWe firmly believe that arrangements must be made to ensure\na fair sharing of the water resources of the Ganges by\nsigning a permanent agreement immediately.\nWe believe in the policy of friendship, cooperation and\npeaceful coexistence with all countries of the world. We\nhave unwavering faith in the principle of the resolution of all\nproblems with all countries, and particularly with our\nneighbours, through peaceful negotiations. Congenial\nconditions have been created for the return of the tribal\nrefugees who left their homes in the Chittagong Hill\ndistricts and have been in India for a long time. This\nbecame possible following a bilateral understanding that was\nreached with India last May.\nDespite obvious economic, social and environmental\ndifficulties, Bangladesh has given shelter to 250,000 refugees\nfrom Myanmar. Bangladesh has not sent back even one\nsingle refugee by force. I am happy to report that after\nconstructive negotiations with all parties concerned,\nincluding Myanmar and the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a congenial\natmosphere has been created for the safe and voluntary\nrepatriation of the refugees. We hope this will lead to a\npermanent solution of the problem.\nOur hopes for a new, peaceful international order were\nraised following the end of the cold war. But these hopes\nseem to be fading in the face of current realities. The forces\nof communalism, racialism and regional hegemony are\nraising their heads in different regions of the world. As a\nresult, mankind is threatened. The blatant violation of the\nnational and human rights of the Bosnian Muslims at the\nhands of the armed Serbian aggressors is a matter of great\nshame for the whole of mankind. The oppression and\ngenocide unleashed by the Serbs against unarmed civilians\nin the name of the abhorrent policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" is\na source of agony for all people of conscience. The\nunabated perpetration of this genocide naturally focuses\nattention on the unequal application of the concept of human\nrights. A nation and its existence as a State are being\nobliterated solely because of religious hatred. The double\nstandard of supplying arms to the Serbs and the Croats while\nthe Muslims remain unarmed is tantamount to violation of\nhuman rights. In the interest of establishing human rights\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 23\nand justice, we call upon the United Nations and all the\npowerful States of the world to take definite steps to\npreserve the independence and sovereignty of the people of\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nBangladesh has always hoped for world peace and\nprosperity. Active participation in United Nations\npeace-keeping efforts has been a priority for us. Some of\nthe significant examples of such participation are the\nmonitoring of elections in Namibia, policing the cease-fire\nline in the Gulf, clearing mines and contributing to\nreconstruction efforts in Kuwait and assisting the United\nNations peace efforts in Cambodia, Somalia and\nMozambique. We strongly support the strengthening of the\nfinancial and institutional base of peace-keeping and its\ngrowth. We are concerned at the observation on the\nfinancial crisis of the world body made by the\nSecretary-General in his report. We urge the affluent\nMember States to come forward and assist in overcoming\nthe crisis to keep the United Nations strong and effective.\nThe recent historic accord between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel is a positive first\nstep towards the establishment of a long-waited peace in the\nMiddle East. We welcome this initiative. We hope that\nIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories,\nincluding Jerusalem, and the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State will be the final objective of these efforts.\nWe remain steadfast in our support for the struggle of\nthe people of South Africa to achieve their cherished goal of\nequal rights and majority rule. In response to the appeal\nmade here in the Assembly by Nelson Mandela, our\nGovernment is moving towards lifting economic sanctions\nagainst South Africa.\nVicious cycles of starvation and violence, a breakdown\nof central authority and endless conflicts continue to bedevil\nin varying ways the situations in Somalia, Angola, Liberia,\nRwanda and Mozambique. We call upon the United Nations\nto take comprehensive measures to establish peace in these\nareas in a more effective manner.\nThirteen years ago, during a similar session of this\nforum, Bangladesh\u2019s great leader and a champion of the\ninterests of the third world, the late President Ziaur Rahman,\nissued a clarion call:\n\\\"We must face the challenge of the contemporary\nworld. The need of the hour is for bold and\nimaginative action. We will not find solutions if we\ncling to outdated concepts and institutions. We must\nact in concert and work for a better and nobler life for\nall sectors of the family of mankind.\\\" (Official Records\nof the General Assembly, Eleventh Special Session, 3rd\nplenary meeting, para. 46)\nHis words are all the more significant today.\nWe are poised at a critical juncture in the advancement\nof world peace and stability. No doubt violence, aggression,\nracism, ethnic and religious conflict and gaping social and\neconomic disparities still exist. Despite these contradictions,\nthere is today a greater confidence and conviction that a\nbrave new world is truly within our reach. We are faced\nwith a rare opportunity to sustain the momentum towards the\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, to strengthen the rule of law\nand to raise the quality of life in greater freedom.\nDemocratic values, the human spirit, human solidarity and\nthe appropriate realization of human development are central\nto achieving these objectives. Today, as we approach the\nend of the twentieth century, we look forward to a balanced,\ntolerant and happy world community where democracy,\npeace, development and human welfare will be equally\navailable to all. This was really the driving force behind the\nestablishment of the United Nations. We have spent half a\ncentury in pursuit of this goal. As we enter the coming\ncentury, this must not remain a mere dream. Let this be our\npledge to the next generation.\n"

Its priority has been to ensure that the profound\npolitical and economic change does not result in global\nconflict. This has sometimes meant coordinating\ninternational efforts. On other occasions the United Nations\nhas had to take the lead in these operations. At the same\ntime, it has continued to take up the challenges presented by\nthe many far-reaching social, humanitarian and\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 7\nenvironmental problems of our day. These have proved\nmore and more difficult to contain within national or even\nregional boundaries.\nThe United Nations responsibilities have often been\nundertaken under most unfavourable conditions. I am\ntherefore pleased that our Secretary-General and the\ncountries representing the United Nations have always\nresponded positively to the situations they have faced. I\nhope that they will continue to do this, even after such\ndistressing events as those which have occurred in Somalia\nthis week.\nI say this because the past year has seen so many\nvaluable achievements. The success of the United Nations\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia has shown what can be\ndone through responsible regional efforts and patient\nmultilateral action. In South Africa, national, regional and\ninternational efforts in support of United Nations resolutions\nhave brought new hope. In the Middle East, the United\nNations has been a positive influence in reducing tension\nafter the Gulf War.\nWe also welcome the agreement between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel. This is the first step\ntowards a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question.\nThere have also been several initiatives aimed at\nimproving the world economy and developing better trading\narrangements in regions. At the same time, the United\nNations has continued to give essential assistance to people\nin developing countries. It has also maintained its peace-\nkeeping operations in a number of problem areas. The\nUnited Nations has also organized important international\nconferences where nations have been able to exchange views\non many matters of international concern. This represents\na considerable contribution to preventive diplomacy and\npeace-building. In each case, I hope these achievements will\nbe consolidated by national and regional authorities.\nIn Cambodia, we wish the new Government every\nsuccess as they go about the task of bringing lasting stability\nto their nation. Like all the countries in our region, we look\nforward to seeing the Cambodian people enjoying peace and\nprosperity again.\nIn South Africa, I believe conditions now exist for\nnational leaders to encourage restraint and seek consensus.\nThe countries in the Gulf region are also in a position\nto work towards peaceful solutions to the remaining areas of\ndifficulty.\nIn the Middle East, current developments should start\na process that will restore all legitimate Palestinian rights\nand should lead to a comprehensive settlement in the region.\nIn terms of the world economy, objectives have been\nset. What we hope to see now is equally clear progress in\nstrengthening linkages between the North and the South and\nin creating conditions that promote cooperation and\nsustainable growth. To do this, we need to improve the\nexisting mechanisms for preventing economic disagreements\nfrom turning into open conflict. Each nation has a\nresponsibility to promote fair trading arrangements\nthroughout the world.\nToday\u2019s overall situation presents many challenges. I\nfeel that we can continue to turn them into positive\ndevelopments if we note carefully the circumstances under\nwhich the United Nations appears to achieve its greatest\nsuccesses. These occur when the special responsibilities of\nnational Governments, non-governmental organizations and\nregional associations are recognized and agreed upon before\nthe world body is asked to act.\nWhere those responsibilities have been in confrontation\nwith each other, the effectiveness of United Nations\noperations has been hindered. This is clearly illustrated in\nSomalia and in Bosnia. In those countries, the United\nNations initially acted in order to guarantee safe and\neffective humanitarian assistance. There have been\nconsiderable successes in these operations, and I thank those\nwho have achieved them for their humanitarian work.\nHowever, these efforts and the fact that conflict has not\nbeen allowed to spread outside the regions concerned should\nnot divert our attention from the deep matters of principle\ninvolved.\nThat is why we wish to express our strong support for\nthe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe\nthat the United Nations Charter would be severely\ncompromised if the Organization became a party to any\narrangement which forces a sovereign nation and fellow\nMember of the United Nations to submit to aggression. Not\nonly would this condone terrorism - it would reward it.\nIn seeking to ensure that the United Nations does not\nbecome merely another factor in a local political equation,\nthere are a number of proposals for reform. These are\nintended to give confidence to Members that United Nations\ndecisions reflect the widest possible spectrum of world\nopinion. If they also assist in solving the world body\u2019s deep\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nfinancial problems, I see merit in considering them\nfavourably.\nWe all have our different views on how the United\nNations should best operate. Whatever they are, I hope we\nwill make every effort to encourage our regional and\nsubregional associations to play a crucial supporting role.\nIdeally, each region will be working on its own agenda for\npeace and development which will complement the work of\nthe world body. The more this is done, the more the United\nNations will be able to act in the way in which it is most\neffective - as the authority of last resort. In this way, I\nbelieve we can make considerable progress towards\nestablishing what the Secretary-General has described as a\nworkable international system.\n"

His\nelection to that important office is an honour to his country,\nwith which Malaysia enjoys warm and friendly relations.\nWith his experience and ability, I am confident that he will\ndischarge his responsibilities well and lead this Assembly to\na successful conclusion of its work.\nI would also like to express my appreciation of his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who discharged his duties\nwith dedication and earnestness and successfully guided the\nefforts to revitalize the work of the General Assembly.\nI also take this opportunity to welcome, on behalf of\nMalaysia, the six countries which have joined the United\nNations since last fall: Andorra, the Czech Republic,\nEritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Their membership will\nhelp to strengthen the United Nations in the execution of its\nincreasingly complex role in the maintenance of international\npeace and security and the promotion of international\neconomic cooperation.\nMalaysia is a developing third world country. We\nshould, according to the stereotypical Western concept of a\nthird world country, be politically unstable, administratively\nincompetent and economically depressed. But we are not\nquite typical. We have actually made progress. We are\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nquite stable despite a multiracial time bomb we inherited\nfrom our colonial past. We are fairly competent in the\nrunning of our affairs. Such is our progress that we actually\ncontemplate building buildings which should be the\npreserves of our betters. And we dare to speak our minds.\nThese are unforgivable sins and we are for ever being\nreminded that we should not be too ambitious. We are told\nthat our achievements are temporary, that next year we will\ngo the way of their preconception of third world countries.\nOf course, last year and the years before we were told the\nsame. But so far we have not obliged. We are, however,\nhumbly aware that nothing is permanent. Our detractors\nmay yet prove right.\nThat we do well and are not in dire need of their\ndevelopment aid is apparently not praiseworthy. Yet, when\nother developing countries perform badly they are chastised\nand told to do better or they will get no more aid or loans.\nBut we will soldier on. We really should not care about\nwhat is said of us. Unfortunately, these negative remarks\nmake life that much more difficult for us.\nWe need foreign investments and to get them we need\na reputation for stability, competence and predictability. But\nwhen investors are told repeatedly that we are about to\nexplode in racial violence, and so on, they are likely to\ninvest elsewhere. Of course, what is said about us is\nuntrue - lies. But these people apparently subscribe to the\ndictum that a lie repeated often enough will be believed.\nWe care for the well-being of our people. We want to\ndevelop so as to give them a reasonable standard of living.\nBut we cannot be cowed into not speaking our minds. If the\npowerful nations do wrong, we will speak out against them\neven if they say we are unduly suspicious, that we have an\nexaggerated sense of our own importance, and so on. We\ncan be belittled but we will continue to speak the truth.\nHere at the United Nations we will say what we feel we\nshould say. Of course, the controlled \\\"free\\\" Western media\nwill not publish it. But the few here will hear us. In any\ncase, it is what we achieve that counts with us. We can do\nwithout Western approval.\nFour or five years ago the world was celebrating the\nimpending collapse of the \\\"evil empire\\\". The Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics was still intact then, but all\nindications were that it had given up the fight; that it was\ncoming to terms with its main adversaries, the countries of\nthe Western so-called free world; and that the cold war was\ndrawing to a close.\nPeace was breaking out all over the world and there\nwas much talk of peace dividends. The arms race would\nend, there would be nuclear disarmament and, as the saying\ngoes, swords would be turned into ploughshares. A brave\nnew world would emerge: equitable, just and prosperous.\nThere would be no oppression, no terror and no poverty or\nstarvation. Everyone would embrace democracy and the\nmarket economy, moving from authoritarian rule and\ncommand economies without a hitch. And a global\npoliceman would see to it that every country stayed in line\nor faced the consequences. There was no end to the good\nthings that would make up the peace dividends.\nIt would be wrong to say that there were no peace\ndividends at all - the Iran-Iraq war, the Soviet occupation of\nAfghanistan, the war in Cambodia, some of the Central\nAmerican wars, and now the violent Palestinian-Israeli\nconfrontation and South Africa\u2019s apartheid were all resolved,\npartially or completely. But the world has not become a\nsafer or a better place for a great many.\nThe Soviet Union did not just become a democratic\npractitioner of free trade, working with the good guys for a\nbetter world. It broke up into a number of republics and\nRussia has become dangerously unstable and ungovernable.\nThe respected great reformer of perestroika and glasnost\nfame was ousted and disgraced and has been replaced by\nanother, who seems to fare no better. The \\\"evil empire\\\" is\nno more. But the price in human lives and the displacement\nof people has been very high. And the price is still being\npaid.\nIn Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan and\nTajikistan, much destruction and many killings have taken\nplace and are still taking place. The old economic structure\nhas been destroyed but the new one is far from being in\nplace. Chaos, bloody chaos, prevails in many places.\nFar from achieving universal peace, the world is treated\nto a spectacle of unparalleled brutality by the Serbs in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. In many countries of Europe,\nfascism has once again reared its ugly head. Houses are\ntorched and people burned to death. And the voters actually\napprove.\nDuring the cold-war days the protagonists constantly\ntried to provoke uprisings against Governments of the\ncountries they were opposed to. They would provide\nfinancial and material help and would promise that they\nwould protect the rebels or provide them with asylum.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 17\nWith the collapse of the Communist bloc, the people\nthere expected help when they overthrew their Communist\nGovernments and established democratic, free-market\nsocieties, or they sought independence for their countries.\nIn some instances they found their expectations justified.\nThe Slovenes and the Croats enjoyed the full support of the\nEuropeans and were able to mould new nations. But the\nIraqi Kurds and the Bosnians learned that they thought\nwrong. It is only coincidental that both are Muslim\ncommunities.\nThe most tragic case is that of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe crime of the Muslims is that they wish for a nonMuslim, religiously heterogenous State. They were viciously\nattacked by the Serbs, who openly declared that they were\ndoing so - and they are still doing so - to ensure that Europe\nremains Christian. And they are not being prevented from\nproceeding in this way by the Europeans.\nThe cruelties committed by the Serbs defy the\nimagination. In one case, which caused officials in one of\nthe powerful countries of the West to resign in protest over\ntheir Government\u2019s passivity, a six-year-old child was\nrepeatedly raped in front of her mother, who not only had to\nwatch but was prevented from giving any help, and the little\nchild died after two days of exposure. That is not an\nisolated incident. Muslim women, old and young, and little\ngirls have been raped, brutalized and killed by the tens of\nthousands at the hands of the Serbs, and now the Croats.\nHundreds of thousands of Muslims have died and are dying,\nand some 2 million have been forced to flee from their\nburning towns and villages.\nAnd what do the erstwhile champions of freedom and\ndemocracy do? They actually prevent the victims from\ndefending themselves. Instead, they try to force the victims\nto accept the partitioning and surrender of their territories,\nwhich have been ethnically cleansed by the Serbs and the\nCroats. Thus are the rapists and murderers to be rewarded.\nOnly the most gullible will still believe that the vociferous\nchampions of freedom and democracy will risk their necks\nfor other people\u2019s freedom and democracy.\nMalaysia would like to record its satisfaction over the\nacceptance of Malaysian troops to serve in the United\nNations forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We regret,\nhowever, the exclusion of certain Muslim countries from\nparticipating in the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR). Apparently, the distrust of Muslims is quite\nwidespread. Malaysians are prepared to serve under\nwhoever is appointed by the United Nations in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. We hope that our troops will be well\nsupported. We will not protest if the United Nations decides\nto increase pressure on the Serbs, even through the mounting\nof a military offensive, provided due preparations are made.\nWhen we add things up, the peace dividends accruing\nfrom the ending of the cold war have not been really\nsubstantial. If there has been any change, the debit side is\nmuch bigger than the credit side. The most glaring example\nis the reneging on the much-needed development assistance\nto poor developing countries.\nStill, when drawing up the balance sheet since the end\nof the cold war one cannot but highlight two significant\nitems on the credit side. The recent signing of the peace\nagreement between the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) and the Israelis and that between blacks and whites\nin South Africa must be regarded as the biggest\nachievements of the post-cold-war period. Admittedly, there\nis still a great deal to be negotiated before justice can be\nrendered to all sides and before true peace becomes\npermanent. But the most crucial obstacles have been\ncleared. I should like to congratulate all the parties\nconcerned for their good sense and their boldness. The\nextremists on both sides will not be happy. There will be\nmore violence. But I am sure that those who are for peace\nand good sense will be as brave in peace as they have been\nin war.\nI commend these accords to the good people of\nNorthern Ireland. It is brave not to surrender even one inch,\nbut it takes real bravery to compromise.\nOne may well ask why, in the face of the muchpublicized failure of the United States-sponsored peace talks\nbetween the PLO and Israel, there should be this sudden\nbreakthrough. The answer is to be found in the press\nstatements. Good sense cannot prevail when the media\ndemands that statements be made by each and everyone\nbefore and after each negotiating session. The negotiators\nare forced to take public stands, to demonstrate how tough\nthey are and that they will not give even an inch. Having\ntaken those stands, they were no longer able to accommodate\ngood sense.\nAt the peace talks in Norway, there was no press, and\ngood sense was able to prevail. There is this great\ndemocratic principle of \\\"the need to know.\\\" But do we all\nreally need to know every detail of every negotiation? Does\nevery Israeli settler or Gaza Strip Arab, or, for that matter,\nevery Tom, Dick and Harry in every part of the world, need\nto know everything about the negotiations? Must\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nPalestinians continue to be killed and be made homeless\nbecause everybody needs to know what was said by whom?\nThis need for transparency, this right to information, is\nan invention of those who want to make money from the\ninformation industry. We should know about the bestiality\nof the Serbs in Bosnia so that we may react, but that\nknowledge is largely denied us. On the other hand, day in\nand day out we are shown this parade of negotiators to a\npeace conference. Can the average man do anything\nworthwhile as a result of seeing the daily TV report?\nWe live in the information age. There has been and\nthere will continue to be an unending explosion in the field\nof information technology. Today, we can sit in our homes\nand watch and hear a war as it is being fought, witness with\neyes and ears a beauty contest as it is being judged, and look\nthrough a microscope at a bug as it swims, all via the TV\nscreen. We see all these things as they are, where they are,\nwithout a second\u2019s delay. We can watch murder as it is\nbeing committed, in all the gory details, and we can be\nshocked by it. But, then, we can also watch\nMichael Jackson doing his moon walk at the very moment\nmass murder and massacres of the most brutal kinds are\nbeing committed.\nWhat we see and hear and witness is what the media\ndecide we should see and hear and witness. If the media\nwants us to be shocked by a massacre, it can broadcast lurid\ndetails of that massacre. But if it chooses to broadcast\nMichael Jackson at the time the massacre was taking place,\nwe will be stomping our feet in total enjoyment.\nClearly, the people who decide what we should see and\nhear hold terrible power. They can have us dancing in the\nstreets or they can have us rioting in the streets with\nfirebrands in our hands, burning, looting and killing. Can\nwe doubt that such people are powerful? Make no mistake:\nthe people who control the media control our minds, and\nprobably control the world. They can make or break\npresidents, and they have done so. Countries can be isolated\nor accepted despite violations of human rights, depending on\nhow the media present them.\nAnd who controls the powerful world media? Not the\nnational governments of tiny developing nations; not even\nthe governments of powerful nations. A very few people in\nthe West control all the international media. Some are\njournalists, but quite a few are not. Collectively they are\nBig Brothers.\nNow they have an even more effective weapon in the\nform of the worldwide television network. Today they\nbroadcast slanted news. Tomorrow they will broadcast raw\npornography to corrupt our children and destroy our culture.\nThey are already doing that in Europe.\nToday we can still control the reception. The day is\nfast approaching when only a coat-hanger will be needed to\nreceive television broadcasts from across the world. We will\nhave nowhere to retreat. Already the small nations are being\naccused of being undemocratic and limiting freedom because\nwe do not allow reception of international television\nnetworks. We hope this is because our accusers believe in\nthe freedom of the press, but we suspect it is because they\nmonopolize the world media and stand to profit substantially\nfrom the freedom they insist every nation should have.\nMalaysia believes in press freedom. But that freedom,\nas with other freedoms and rights, must be accompanied by\nresponsibility. We will continue to expect the Malaysian\nmedia to be responsible. We will not forgo the need to\nenforce that responsibility. But as to the international press,\nwe can only hope and pray that they will realize the damage\nthey are doing. We will not interfere with them. They are\nfree to report and to write any number of lies but we hope\nthat occasionally they will cover the truth as well. Power\ncorrupts, but power without responsibility is the most\ncorrupting influence of all.\nWe have heard often enough of the need for\nrestructuring the United Nations. We need this because the\nworld has changed. It is not the world of the immediate\npost-Second-World-War period that we have today. The\npeople who plunged the world into a horrendous war are\nnow the good guys, telling the world how to be humane.\nThe rapacious invaders of the past are now the good\nSamaritans, distributing aid to the needy. Will there always\nbe no room for the reformed?\nWe talk of democracy as the only acceptable system of\ngovernment. It is so good that we cannot wait for the\ndemocratic process to bring about its own acceptance by\nevery country. It must be forced upon everyone, whether\nwelcome or not. Yet when it comes to the United Nations,\nwe eschew democracy. And the most undemocratic aspect\nof the United Nations is the veto power of the five\npermanent members of the Security Council. We can accept\nsome weighting in their favour, but for each of them alone\nto be more powerful than the whole membership of the\nUnited Nations is not acceptable; it was not before, it is not\nnow, and will not be in the future.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 19\nFor the time being, there can be some permanent\nmembers. But the veto must go. A formula must be found\nfor new permanent members of the Security Council.\nWhatever the other qualifications may be, they must include\na genuine and sincere interest in international welfare.\nAt the ministerial-level World Conference on Human\nRights held at Vienna this year, a more comprehensive\ndefinition of human rights was presented. Many countries\nlike Malaysia were smeared in Vienna for allegedly refusing\nto accept the universality of human rights. We subscribe to\nthe universality of human rights, but not to the irresponsible\nvariety propounded by the West. Human rights is not a\nlicence to do anything without regard to the rights of others.\nThe rights of the majority are just as valid as the rights of\nthe minority or the individual. A society has a right to\nprotect itself from the unbridled exercise of rights by\nindividuals or a minority, which in the West has contributed\nto the collapse of morality and of the structure of human\nsociety.\nIf individual and minority rights are so totally\ninviolable, then you must allow the resurgence of nazism\nand its violently racist activities in Europe and elsewhere.\nBut it is apparent that the West at least still thinks that racist\nviolence is wrong. We hope they will also accept that\nfreedom from poverty and the wish to develop are essential\nelements of human rights.\nFinally, countries like Malaysia must take exception to\npreaching on human rights from people who willingly\ncondone, and to a certain degree aid, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Until they redeem themselves\nthere, all their talk of human rights will sound hollow.\nThis litany of the woes of the developing countries and\nthe world may seem endless. Actually, the list is far from\ncomplete. Trade and protectionism, aid and debts, the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment and pressures on environmental issues,\nAntarctica and many more have not been touched upon.\nThe world of the post-cold-war period is not a\nthoroughly bad place, but for the developing countries,\nincluding Malaysia, there is really very little to crow about.\nA statement in the General Assembly is not going to\nchange the world. But there is really nowhere else that the\nwoes of the third world can be aired. Not to air them is to\nencourage supercilious arrogance on the part of those who\nare most responsible yet who still presume to extol their own\nvirtues and to preach to others. Even if the benefit is\nminimal, the truth must be told sometimes.\n"

        "file_text": " Let me extend to\nyou, Sir, the warm greetings of my Government and the\npeople of Solomon Islands. We congratulate you on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this forty-\neighth session. Your experience, diplomatic skills and\nleadership assure us of a successful and fruitful session.\nI also join in the tributes paid to your distinguished\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria,\nfor the excellent manner in which he presided over the\naffairs of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nWe join, too, in acknowledging and commending the\nreport (A/48/1) of the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros-Boutros Ghali, on the\nwork of the Organization. The report is a comprehensive\ncatalogue of the achievements of the United Nations, its\nstrengths and weaknesses, the threats and opportunities the\nOrganization faces and the challenges it has before it. All\nthese point to one common truth: there is an undeniable\ndisparity between idealism and reality, between the mounting\nresponsibilities of the Organization and its capacity to\nachieve pragmatic, focused and specific goals. The gap\nbetween promotion of the ideals of the Charter and\nrealization of them continues to widen.\nOver the last three weeks, we have heard Member\nStates renewing their support for, and commitment to, this\nbody. It is clear that the Organization is calling out for our\nattention. It needs us all, just as much as we need it;\nperhaps it now needs us more than ever before to strengthen\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nit and enhance its performance in its delivery of services and\ngoods to our many peoples around the globe.\nMr. President, your opening statement 22 days ago\nconcluded with the visionary challenge, \\\"We the peoples -\nunited for a better world\\\" (A/48/PV.1). In the spirit of a\nfamily of nations, the United Nations will be celebrating this\ntheme at its fiftieth anniversary in 1995. While Solomon\nIslands shares this vision, it counsels against extravagance,\nwaste and mere symbolistic ceremonials which do not reflect\nlong-term substantive benefits. To mark the occasion with\nserious reflection, education and communication, careful\nplanning and a wider consultation programme at all levels of\nthe international community will be essential. Awareness\nprogrammes and activities aimed at promoting the principle\nof unity in diversity should be a key to strength and wealth,\nboth for nations and for the global community. A goal\nwhich can be promoted during the fiftieth-anniversary\ncelebrations is that of world citizenship, or citizens of planet\nEarth.\nThe basis for this should be very simple: everyone\nliving on this planet has a responsibility for its sustainable\ngrowth. Everyone must be aware of, and feel concerned at,\nthe possibility of our destroying the planet. Individuals\nmake up communities. Communities make up nations.\nNations make up the global community. The global\ncommunity lives on this planet.\n\nCitizens of Planet Earth, or world citizenship, is a\nunifying vision of a peaceful, prosperous global society.\nThis emerges from a sense of responsibility and the\nacceptance of the oneness of humanity. To embrace this\nvision of world citizenship into the twenty-first century,\nleaders and Governments must change their attitudes to take\non the greatest challenge facing the world community -\nreleasing the enormous financial, technical, human and moral\nresources required for the sustainable development of our\nplanet. Can we collectively face this challenge in order to\nimplement the various components of Agenda 21? The\nanswer lies in the hands of the people and the nations of the\nworld. How can we make this theme a reality - a reality not\nonly for us at this time but also for future generations on\nthis planet?\nI was heartened to hear the President of the United\nStates, Mr. Bill Clinton, say these words on the first day of\nthe general debate:\n\\\"The United States intends to remain engaged and to\nlead.\\\" (A/48/PV.4, p. 8)\nHe also went on to say:\n\\\"... we must and will serve as a fulcrum for change and\na pivot point for peace.\\\" (ibid.)\nThe Solomon Islands is currently working with the\nUnited Nations Development Programme on a pilot\nprogramme called \\\"Children of Planet Earth\\\" (COPE).\nCOPE is an environmental educational-awareness\nprogramme aimed at primary-school children. It will be\nincorporated into the school curriculum as a module\ncompulsory for all children. There will be no pass or fail\ngrade, but any child who completes the module will get a\nUnited Nations badge or a certificate. The module will\nfocus on the environment and on sustainable growth, and\nnational, regional and international perspectives will be built\ninto it. The Solomon Islands strongly believes that\neducation with regard to the environment is important and\ndeserves priority investment. The target group is the\nchildren, because they will be the leaders of tomorrow.\nTwo weeks ago, His Excellency Shimon Peres, Israeli\nForeign Minister, described war and peace in this way:\n\\\"In war, the old bury the young, and in peace, the\nyoung bury the old.\\\"\nI thought this was quite revealing. It tells of a reality,\na reality which has written a new chapter with a change of\nheart. The handshake between Palestine Liberation\nOrganization leader Mr. Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister\nMr. Rabin on Capitol Hill symbolized a major milestone in\nMiddle East history. The Solomon Islands welcomes this\ngreat advancement in human relations between these two\nnations. It is hoped that the process of creating forgiveness\nand trust will pave the way for lasting peace in the Middle\nEast. I applaud the countries that have pledged financial\nassistance or assistance in kind to Palestine.\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nopened at the dawn of a new era in South African history.\nAfrican National Congress leader Mr. Nelson Mandela,\nrenowned for his struggle against apartheid, made a moving\nstatement at this very rostrum requesting the lifting of\neconomic sanctions against South Africa. To see Mr.\nMandela and President De Klerk moving towards South\nAfrica\u2019s first non-racial elections is an immense and\npromising change. At last, both leaders have decided to\ntravel in the same bus of democracy. We too join the rest\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 7\nof the world in welcoming this first historic step towards\nmajority rule in South Africa.\nThe parameters for the global agenda of the United\nNations General Assembly have evolved slowly over the\nyears. However, not only have agenda items changed from\ntime to time, but they have increased in number as well.\nThe issues before the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly fall into the following broad categories: first,\nmaking and keeping peace; second, arms controls and\ndisarmament; third, economics and development; fourth,\nglobal resource management; fifth, human rights and other\nsocial issues; sixth, international legal issues; and seventh,\nfinancing and administration of the United Nations.\nEach of these broad headings receives a thorough\nsurvey and analysis at every session of the General\nAssembly from both the developed and the developing parts\nof the globe. Some speakers focus specifically on certain\nissues, such as making and keeping peace, or arms control\nand disarmament; others draw the General Assembly\u2019s\nattention to such matters as economic development, global-\nresources management, human rights and other social issues.\nThe debate so far has been interesting.\nA quick overview of what has been said so far from\nthis rostrum reveals a global picture that is both bright and\ngloomy. One truth, articulated by almost every speaker in\nthe area of world peace and security is that the threat of\nconflicts between States has not diminished, even after the\nsuper-Power rivalry has been eroded. Senator Gareth Evans,\nthe Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, captured the\nquestion of world peace and security in a more imperative\nway when he addressed this Assembly at its 5th meeting, on\n27 September. He referred to the resurgence of\nethno-nationalism, which often takes a violent form, giving\nethnic groups a claim to minority human rights protection as\nwell as a claim to self-determination.\nSpeaking on behalf of the European Communities,\nMr. Willy Claes, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium, patrolled the\nmajor trouble spots of the world in a memorandum attached\nto his statement. The Solomon Islands appreciates the\nefforts of the European Communities in resolving regional\nconflicts throughout the world and welcomes its commitment\nto world peace and security. The Balkan crisis has become\na cryptic jigsaw puzzle. Human suffering continues.\nPeacemakers and peace-keepers have tried, and are still\ntrying, to find a solution. The Solomon Islands deplores the\natrocities committed and appeals to the nations with ways\nand means to bring peace to this region. As peace is being\ngiven a chance in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Latin\nAmerica and the South Pacific regions, so may it be given\na chance in the Balkan region.\nIn his address to the General Assembly on 28\nSeptember, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian\nFederation referred to the Bosnian conflict and remarked:\n\\\"... the key to the settlement of many conflicts has not\nyet been found.\\\" (Official Records of the General\nAssembly, Forty-eight Session, Plenary Meetings, 6th\nMeeting, p. 15)\nHe also said:\n\\\"In any case, it is surely time to think of establishing\ncloser contacts between the United Nations and the\nworld\u2019s leading religions.\\\" (ibid., p. 15)\nIt appears that there is a missing dimension to the\napproaches employed in conflict resolution.\nAs we consider the growing number of problems\nconfronting our world, we cannot escape the feeling that the\nsolutions will not simply be political, economic or social. In\nmany cases, the problems are so complex and so deep-seated\nthat we need superhuman help. A new prescription for true\npeace must include the development of the spiritual and\npastoral well-being of all peoples around the world.\nTo this important extent, my Government recognizes,\nas its first principle,\n\\\"the sovereignty of God as the basis of\nrighteousness, justice and dignity in the\ndevelopment of the Solomon Islands and its\npeople.\\\"\nWe realize that neither the individual nor society can achieve\nfull potential without the help of Almighty God. If God is\nsovereign in the affairs of our world, would we not be wise\nto bring Him into the planning process as well as give Him\na place in the resolution of conflicts, whether national,\nregional or global?\nThe question of New Caledonia, in the South Pacific,\nhas been on the agenda of the United Nations for some\ntime - but not for much longer, I hope. Solomon Islands\njoins its colleagues in the South Pacific region in endorsing\nthe recent report on New Caledonia of the Ministerial\nCommittee of the South Pacific Forum. As a member of\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthat Committee, I hereby humbly express our appreciation\nand gratitude for the cooperation and support of the French\nand territorial authorities in facilitating the recent visit of\nMinisters to the Territory. My Government also reaffirms\nits strong support for the Committee\u2019s recommendations and\nrenews its firm support for the aspirations and goals of the\npeople of New Caledonia, including the Kanak community.\nWe note the progress of the Matignon Accords, and, while\nsensitive to the varying and conflicting interpretations and\nexpectations, we urge all parties to maintain their\ncommitment to the Matignon process and to the promotion\nof economic, political and social development in New\nCaledonia.\nThe United Nations is a strong supporter of peace.\nThis noble world body has, to date, supported the\nreunification of the two Germanys and of the two Koreas.\nIn this context, reunification means only one thing - the\nuniting of people. Unification means peace and coexistence.\nConflicts in areas around the world should be resolved\nthrough dialogue. Thus, we believe that the United Nations\nmechanism that was used in the case of Germany and in the\ncase of the two Koreas should be applied to the situation\ninvolving the Republic of China and the People\u2019s Republic\nof China.\nSolomon Islands recognizes the need for reunification\nof the two Chinas through good will and in good faith. We\ncall on both to hold talks, on equal terms, on the basis of\nthis important United Nations principle. But the process can\nbe successful only if this world body considers the\nexceptional situation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in\nthe international context, based on the principle of\nuniversality of membership and in accordance with the\nestablished model of parallel representation of divided\ncountries at the United Nations.\nSolomon Islands fully recognizes and strongly supports\nthe wish of the people of the Republic of China to rejoin the\nUnited Nations. As a small, friendly nation with a\npopulation of only about 300,000, Solomon Islands firmly\nbelieves that the desire of the 21 million people of the\nRepublic of China in Taiwan for their own representation in\nthis world body is reasonable and justified. We are sure that\nthe international community would benefit from the positive\ncontribution that the Republic of China is capable of making\nto this Organization. Our own country has benefited, in the\npast 10 years, from the economic development and\ntechnological progress that the people of the Republic of\nChina have secured through achieving for their country such\na high position in the league of the industrialized nations.\nSolomon Islands therefore supports the call from other\nMember States for the establishment of an ad hoc committee\nto examine the question of the Republic of China rejoining\nthe United Nations.\nThe mere existence of weapons of mass destruction\nposes a big threat to global peace and security. However,\neven more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear,\nchemical, biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of\ntheir falling into the wrong hands. We applaud the countries\nthat have taken positive steps towards the elimination of\nthese weapons. We also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport on new dimensions of arms regulation and\ndisarmament in the post-cold-war era. We believe in the\nintegration of arms-regulation efforts into the broader\nstructure of international peace and security, the\nglobalization of arms control and of the disarmament process\nand the revitalization of arms control. We strongly propose\nthat the arms-control and disarmament agenda clearly reflect\nthe realities of the post-cold-war era. This is the challenge\nfor the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nTurning to nuclear testing in our region, I must say that\nour continuing desire and concern is to ensure that the South\nPacific region remains a nuclear-free zone and a zone free\nof all types of radioactive waste. Solomon Islands therefore\nmaintains its support for further suspension of nuclear testing\nin our region. We warmly welcome the decisions of the\nUnited States, Russia and France to extend their testing\nmoratoriums. In this vein, owing to recent developments,\nwe call upon China and the United Kingdom seriously to\nconsider declaring similar moratoriums.\nSolomon Islands is gravely concerned about the\ndumping of radioactive and other waste at sea. We therefore\nurge the States parties to the London Dumping Convention\nof 1972, when they adopt amendments in November this\nyear, to continue their active support for a total ban on such\ndumping.\nThe shipment of plutonium, with the danger that it\nposes to the fragile marine ecosystem of the South Pacific,\nis a matter of major concern to the Governments of the\nregion. The highest international safety and security\nstandards must be adhered to. Any nation engaging in this\nbusiness must satisfactorily address all possible\ncontingencies.\nThere is a clear message in statements issued by States\nmembers of the Group of 77. It points to the increasing\nconnection between environmental concerns and\ndevelopmental issues, to the delicate balance between the\nenvironment and development, between population and\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 9\ndevelopment, and between good government and\ndevelopment.\nMember countries of the South Pacific Forum were\nwell represented at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro,\nBrazil, in June 1992. A principal outcome of the Rio\nConference is Agenda 21 - an action plan for the 1990s and\nthe twenty-first century. It sets forth strategies and\nintegrated-programme measures to halt and reverse the\neffects of environmental degradation and to promote\nenvironmentally sound and sustainable development in all\ncountries.\nOnce again Solomon Islands reaffirms its strong\ncommitment to sustainable development. We believe that\nsound environmental practices constitute an integral part of\nthe development process. Thus, all development activities\npursued must be both economically and ecologically sound.\nThe collective voice of small island developing States is\nheard through the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)\nwhich share unique circumstances, vulnerabilities and\nlimitations. These include their small size and relative\ngeographic remoteness, a narrow range of resources, severe\npopulation stress, sometimes minimal renewable fresh water\nresources, and high degrees of endemism. These pressures\nand limitations underscore the need for careful and\nsustainable management of resources to sustain future\ngenerations. This point was highlighted in our country\u2019s\nstatement last year.\nSolomon Islands, like its other South Pacific\nneighbours, continues to rely heavily, and in some cases\ntotally, on the sea, the land, the rivers, the forests and the air\naround us for its livelihood and survival. Solomon Islands\ntherefore attaches great importance to environmental issues\nand accords high priority to collective efforts in the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\nfollow-up activities and the implementation of Agenda 21,\nincluding other, associated principles and conventions.\nSolomon Islands is a party to the Port Vila Declaration on\nPopulation and Sustainable Development. We therefore\ncontinue to support preparations for the forthcoming two\nmajor Conferences in 1994 - the Barbados Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States and the Cairo World Conference on\nPopulation and Development.\nSolomon Islands is one of the few countries in the\nSouth Pacific that now has a national environment\nmanagement strategy endorsed by the Government. That\nstrategy is now in the implementation phase, in which\npriority areas for action at the national level have been\nidentified.\nHuman-induced climate change and its subsequent\neffect of sea-level rise is perhaps the most intractable threat\nto human well-being and the survival of many species on\nEarth. The South Pacific is no exception. Solomon Islands\nis a signatory of the Framework Convention on Climate\nChange and will soon complete the necessary requirements\nfor its ratification. The formalities for the ratification of the\nMontreal Protocol are under way. We warmly welcome the\nspeedy action of the United Nations in establishing a\nCommission on Sustainable Development and, in particular,\nwe welcome the acceptance of the South Pacific Forum\nsecretariat as a special representative to the Commission and\nthe South Pacific Regional Environment Programme\n(SPREP) as an observer in the Commission.\nSolomon Islands applauds the initiative taken by the\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea in putting forward,\nthrough the United Nations system, the agenda item on\nopportunity and participation. The adverse economic\nchanges in recent years have created difficult circumstances\nfor many small countries. There is a need to identify\noptions in order to make possible participation by\nGovernments and peoples of developing countries on an\nequal footing. Solomon Islands welcomes the proposal in\nthe Papua New Guinea initiative for the establishment of a\npanel of experts to study and recommend ways of increasing\nopportunity and participation for developing countries.\nSpeaking about Papua New Guinea, I should like to\nconvey Solomon Islands\u2019 profound appreciation to the\nUnited Nations for the goodwill mission it sent last year to\ndiscuss the problems we had encountered at the border\nbetween Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. I am\nhappy to report that the new Solomon Islands Government,\nthrough its six-point initiative, is working constructively with\nits neighbour, Papua New Guinea, to find a lasting peaceful\nsolution to the problems at our border.\nProper management and good fishing practices are\nessential for the sustainable use of marine living resources.\nThe major income earner of Solomon Islands is fisheries.\nSolomon Islands supports the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea. Preparations for its ratification are\nbeing considered. The Solomon Islands Government\nstrongly supports the work of the Forum Fisheries Agency\n(FFA) and appeals to distant-water fishing nations to\ncooperate with the management and conservation measures\nstipulated by that Agency.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe new Government of Solomon Islands has just\nofficially launched its blueprint document entitled,\n\\\"Statement of Policies\\\". The Government\u2019s philosophy of\nwhere and how to steer the country over the next four years\nis laid out in this document. The Government is embarking\non a major programme of economic and social reforms\naimed at attaining sustainable development. The ministries\nresponsible are currently discussing and putting together a\nprogramme of structural adjustment. The programme\nemphasizes the sustainable management of natural resources,\npublic-sector reforms and the promotion of private-sector\ndevelopment. It devotes particular attention to the sizes and\ncosts of institutions, and outlines proposals for the\nredeployment of resources to areas of production and need.\nThe preparation of this programme is expected to be\ncompleted by November 1993.\nWhile this exercise is considered to be a long-term\nviable undertaking, it is necessary to seek external\nassistance. The Government of Solomon Islands is fully\ncommitted to this long-overdue reform, but appeals to\ninternational financial institutions and donors to provide\nfinancial assistance and advice.\nOn human rights, the Solomon Islands Government\nfully supports the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\nAction which were the outcome of the World Conference on\nHuman Rights held from 14 to 25 June 1993. Fundamental\nrights and freedoms of the individual are listed in chapter II,\nsections 3 to 19 of our national Constitution. We condemn\nany violation of human rights anywhere in the world. We\nalso join the rest of the world in the promotion of human\nrights and support those who have spoken in favour of the\nestablishment of a post of high commissioner for human\nrights. Such a post would indeed be a worthwhile\ninvestment.\nSolomon Islands also salutes the work and courage of\nthose countries that contribute troops and humanitarian\nassistance to trouble-spots all over the world. We pray for\nthe souls of those who have died in the field. We strongly\ndeplore the actions of those who have committed atrocities\nagainst peace-keepers, Red Cross workers and associated\npersonnel. Solomon Islands therefore strongly supports New\nZealand\u2019s initiative in requesting the inscription on the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s agenda of the critical item on the safety\nof personnel in United Nations peace-keeping operations.\nThe United Nations Charter has now been physically\nreduced to a pocket-sized booklet, but the demands the\nnations of the world place on this global Organization\noutstrip the limits of its capabilities and the resources at its\ndisposal. Perhaps this is a positive sign - a justification of\nthe need for its continuing existence.\nA few more flags have been added at the United\nNations this year. We warmly welcome the new Members\nof the United Nations family and congratulate their\nGovernments and peoples on taking this courageous step.\nIn 1945 the founders of the United Nations saw the\nneed to set up this body. Today, we are challenged in no\nuncertain terms to ensure that the work that was begun 48\nyears ago continues, to keep the Organization alive, relevant,\nmeaningful and cost effective. It is the only hope for world\npeace and security and for the promotion of democracy,\ndevelopment and global-resource management. Member\nStates request the Organization to be accountable, and so we\nMember States too must return to it our individual due\nresponsibilities.\nMay the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations bring\na new dawn to human relations between all peoples around\nthe world.\n"

        "file_text": "The year that has elapsed since the forty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly was noteworthy for\nthe further growth in the authority and the effectiveness of\nthe United Nations. It testifies, in our view, to the deep\nunderstanding that the members of the world community\nhave about the need for close, constructive cooperation in\nthe name of a better future. As I look around this Hall, in\nwhich, for the first time, a Head of State of a sovereign\nTajikistan is speaking, the words of the great poet Saadi\ncome to my mind:\n\\\"The sons of Man are but one body\nFor the Creator made us all from but one beginning\\\".\nNow that I find myself here, in the centre for settling\nthe problems of the whole world, I should first of all like to\ncongratulate Mr. Samuel Insanally, the Permanent\nRepresentative of Guyana, on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly. Allow me to express the hope\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5\nthat this session, under your skilful leadership, Mr. President,\nwill achieve tangible, successful results for the good of all\nmankind. I should also like to draw attention to the\nexcellent work done by Mr. Stoyan Ganev, President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its last session; Mr. Ganev both\nenergetically and effectively guided the deliberations on\ncomplex political problems.\nIt is with great satisfaction that I greet\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General of the United\nNations, and express to him our sincere gratitude for his\ntireless efforts to resolve the conflicts in various parts of the\nworld, not excluding my own country.\nThe Republic of Tajikistan is taking its first steps as a\nsubject of international law. It is with deep satisfaction that\nI note that we have been granted an equal voice in the\ncommonwealth of nations, and we are aware that this\nhonourable right imposes significant duties on us.\nThe two years of our independence, in addition to\nmoments that are undoubtedly positive, have also entailed\nthe harsh trials that my patient and peace-loving people are\nnow going through. It is for the historians to study the root\ncauses, the reasons for the situation in Tajikistan today. I\nthink that my job is to point out just one thing: those whom\nwe believe, on the basis of the law in force in the Republic\nof Tajikistan, to be guilty of unleashing civil war are guilty\nof grossly violating the very foundations of any modern\nsociety, namely the primacy of law.\nAs in any civil war, in the civil war in Tajikistan there\ncan be no victors. Our urgent task as a nation is to heal, as\nquickly as possible, the bloody wounds that it has inflicted\non our country.\nThe attention the community of nations is paying\nTajikistan is understandable. Nor should we be surprised at\nthe variety of opinions we hear when events in the Republic\nare being analysed. I should like to shed some necessary\nlight on a number of issues.\nNow that we have set out on the path of independent\ndevelopment, we have run up against the enormous political\nand socio-economic problems of the transitional period.\nOur national economy was built up as just one small\npart of the enormous economic complex of the former\nUSSR, and was basically a provider of raw materials. With\nthe collapse of those economic ties, our Republic has come\nface to face with many almost insoluble problems. There\nhas been a catastrophic drop in the standard of living, which\ncould hardly fail to lead to an increase in social tension.\nThe power struggle that developed at the same time and\nthe attempts to seize power illegally, by force and\nundemocratically, have split society apart and led to a\nsenseless, fratricidal war. The results of this we know:\nthousands of broken lives, thousands of dead and wounded,\nrefugees and missing. Immeasurable political, social and\neconomic harm has been done to the Republic.\nThe internal instability has become the main reason for\nthe economic and political chaos, the total legal confusion\nand the sharp drop in production. The future of our people -\nthe future of Tajik statehood - has been put in jeopardy.\nThe sixteenth session of the Supreme Council of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan, which was held in these conditions,\nlaid fundamentally new foundations for establishing peace\nand civil harmony in our country. The Supreme Council has\ndecided in favour of solving all political, social and\neconomic problems solely within the framework of the\nconstitution. A number of important laws have been adopted\nthat are designed to afford citizens social protection and to\nreturn them to their homes and peace-time jobs.\nIn accordance with the Constitution, we have elected a\nleadership for the Supreme Council and formed a\nGovernment. Today our society and our people have\nbecome aware that the highest power in the State should be\nthe law, and only the law.\nAs the Head of State, I declare, from this rostrum, that\nwe shall adhere to the fundamental principles of the Final\nAct of the Helsinki Conference and the Paris Charter and\nother international instruments for the defence of law. We\nare determined to carry out democratic transformations in\nour country and to acknowledge and respect philosophical,\nreligious, ideological and political choice as an inalienable\nright of the individual.\nWorking under the constant pressure of political and\nsocio-economic problems, we have succeeded in a short time\nin removing the economic blockade from all the regions of\nthe Republic and have begun rebuilding our destroyed\nnational economy and instituting economic reforms in order\ngradually to introduce a free market.\nFrom the beginning of the restoration of our Republic,\nour Parliament has adhered to the principle of the primacy\nof law, and in so doing has passed a number of measures,\nwhile the Presidium of the Supreme Council has laid down\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthree special decrees on amnesty. Does not this show that\nwe are acting to resolve through political means the\nproblems that have accumulated in our country? We are\nprepared for dialogue with all the social forces in our\ncountry to achieve national reconciliation, civil harmony and\nstability in Tajikistan.\nWe would like to cooperate constructively with forces\nof any political orientation acting within the framework of\nexisting law and respecting generally accepted principles of\ndemocracy. I would like to inform the world community\nthat Tajikistan is actively working to improve its election\nlaws and to prepare a draft new Constitution in which\nmaximum attention will be given to all problems related to\nguaranteeing and protecting inalienable human rights.\nIn terms of settling our domestic political problems, we\nare seriously concerned over the attempts at regionalization\nof the internal conflict in Tajikistan, a conflict which is still\ngoing on in a number of areas along the Tajik-Afghan\nborder. The outbreak of the conflict this summer brought\ndozens of deaths.\nAllow me briefly to tell the Assembly my view of the\nessential reasons for the tensions along and inside the border.\nEveryone knows that until recently Tajikistan had been\nsystematically subjected to unprovoked acts of armed\nintervention from the territory of a neighbouring country.\nNaturally, we understand its internal difficulties related to\nestablishing a centralized State administration. But facts\ncannot be denied, and we have now been faced with the\nneed seriously to deal with the question of self-defence.\nWe are not hatching any hostile plan with regard to\nAfghanistan. The measures which we have taken and are\ntaken to strengthen the defence of our border - which is also\na border of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) -\ndo not go beyond what is laid down in Article 51 of the\nUnited Nations Charter and are fully in keeping with\ngenerally accepted norms of international relations.\nBut this, of course, does not mean that that is the only\nway to solve the problem. And here we are encouraged by\nthe notable speed-up in the negotiating process with the\nauthorities in Kabul. We have achieved a number of\npositive agreements on a broad spectrum of questions,\nincluding normalizing the situation along the Tajik-Afghan\nborder. We think that a permanent, substantive dialogue\nwith the leadership of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will\nhelp us remove some other well-known irritants.\nIt is most unfortunate that huge resources are still being\nspent to support destructive elements based on the territory\nof Afghanistan. Having gone there from Tajikistan, they are,\nwith the help of extremist groups and the forces of\ninternational terrorism, hatching plans forcibly to change the\nState structure in our country. A legitimate question arises:\nis it not wiser to use these resources to build rather than to\ndestroy?\nAnother of our problems is that of the Tajik refugees in\nAfghanistan. There are many versions of how they ended up\non the territory of Afghanistan, but that is not the main\npoint, which is that they should return to their homeland as\nquickly as possible. We express our sincere thanks to the\nAdministration of Afghanistan and to the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, who are giving serious\nattention to those people. As of the middle of September,\nmore than 35,000 Tajik refugees - more than half the total -\nhad returned to their permanent homes from Afghanistan.\nWe hope that the process of voluntary return will continue\nand that with the support of the authorities of Afghanistan\nand of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\nwe shall in the near future be able to put an end once and\nfor all to this painful question.\nWe have already completed our preparation for signing\na trilateral agreement between Tajikistan, Afghanistan and\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We\nhope that the agreement will be signed as soon as possible.\nFrom this United Nations rostrum, I should like to say\none more thing in this regard. We are firmly convinced that\nthe support of the Administration of Afghanistan in efforts\nto restore peace to the Afghan land, which has suffered so\nmuch, would be in the interests not only of that country but\nof the region and of the entire world. There was a time\nwhen some States spent a great deal of resources on war in\nAfghanistan. In my view, the time has come to help restore\na peaceful life there. A restless, unstable Afghanistan is a\nthreat - and not only to Tajikistan.\nRegarding our participation in the CIS, I must\nemphasize that Tajikistan is in favour of strengthening the\nCommonwealth while observing full respect for the\nsovereignty and independence of its member States. In this\ncontext, I should like to point out the significance of two\nareas of our activities within the framework of the CIS,\nactivities which are critically important for Tajikistan. I am\ntalking about relations with Russia and with the Central\nAsian States.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 7\nRussia, as a permanent member of the Security Council,\nhas undergone great trials in taking upon itself the\nmaintenance of peace and stability in virtually all the space\nand territory of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, the\npeoples of the former Soviet Union, including Tajikistan,\ncommend and welcome the peace-keeping efforts made by\nRussia.\nA positive role in stabilizing the situation in our country\nhas been played by the brotherly support of Uzbekistan,\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Tajikistan also thanks\nthe United States and all the other countries of Europe and\nAsia that extended the hand of assistance to us during\nterrible and dark days.\nWe hope that Tajikistan will quickly be removed from\nthe blacklist of conflict areas. In this respect, we count upon\nthe tangible assistance of the world community in restoring\nour national economy, which has been destroyed by war and\nby natural disasters. A country which is rich in natural\nresources, which has an attraction in terms of its economic\nprospects, needs purposeful assistance in order to be reborn.\nAllow me to express the hope that that assistance and that\nsupport will naturally, in accordance with generally accepted\nprinciples in world practice, be given to my country.\nTajikistan, which has gone through the horrors of a\ncivil war, views with great concern the course of events in\nthe hot spots of our planet. We know of the pain and\nsuffering of the people of Somalia. We feel the full depth\nand senselessness of the tragedy of the peoples of the former\nYugoslavia, the deadlocked events which have taken place\nin the Caucasus of the post-Soviet era. We also know\nfirsthand how destructive is the force of local conflicts. That\nis why we make an urgent appeal to the world community\nto multiply its efforts to end, and to prevent, that type of\nconflict. We are firmly convinced that the force of arms, no\nmatter how threatening and frightening they may be, cannot\nsolve a single contentious issue.\nIn this connection, we are seriously concerned by the\nuncontrolled and unsanctioned trade in arms in areas of\nintense instability. Essentially, what is happening is a\nmassive arming of entire regions. Indeed, we can imagine\nhow unbelievably difficult it is to take away from a\npopulation weapons that they have illegally obtained. On\nthe basis of our own bitter experience, we loudly speak out\nabout the danger of that fateful trend.\nToday, this destructive impact on our economy has\nbeen joined by another: the aspiration of a number of\ncountries to acquire nuclear weapons or the technology to\nproduce them. As a country which has the technology for\nmining and initially processing uranium, we categorically\noppose the use of that priceless source of energy for\nnon-peaceful purposes.\nWe state our unconditional support for the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, and we hope that the conference of\nthe States parties to that Treaty, scheduled for 1995, will\ndecide to extend it indefinitely.\nAs the Assembly knows, the end of the cold war and\nbipolar confrontation gave rise to great hopes on the part of\nthe peoples of the world. Unfortunately, events have not yet\njustified many of these hopes. None the less, there is one\nplace in the world where notable political events have been\nobserved. We are deeply satisfied with the historic\nagreements reached between the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization and the State of Israel on mutual recognition.\nWe welcome the decision of the United States of\nAmerica to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization,\nand we commend that great country for its role in supporting\npeace and stability on earth.\nThe questions which the General Assembly will be\ndiscussing at its forty-eighth session show that there is now\nan onward rush towards the interdependence of nations. In\nTajikistan we are convinced of this.\nWe commend the peace-keeping and humanitarian\nefforts of the United Nations. We are especially proud of\nTajikistan\u2019s initiative to include institutions of the\nCommonwealth of Nations in the broad peace-keeping\nactivities on the territory of our country; that initiative has\nnot been ignored.\nThe mandate for the presence in Tajikistan of the\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ismat Kittani,\nhas been extended. The Republic has fruitfully worked with\nthe United Nations Observer Mission, the representative of\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, and the representatives\nof other international non-governmental organizations.\nOur special gratitude goes to the Security Council of\nthe United Nations, which constantly monitors developments\nin the situation in and around Tajikistan. We sincerely hope\nthat the efforts of the community of nations will be\nincreasingly focused on ensuring the conditions for\nsustainable development.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe wholeheartedly support the principles and\nrecommendations of Agenda 21. We feel that accomplishing\nthat Agenda\u2019s important goals, such as the transfer of\ntechnology and resources, will have a favourable impact on\ndisaster areas such as the Aral Sea and areas of great\npoverty.\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure the Assembly that\nmy people, who have now embarked upon establishing their\nown statehood and have overcome considerable difficulties\nin so doing, look to the future with a feeling of great and, I\nhope, justified optimism.\nWe will spare no effort, we shall use all our energy, in\nbuilding a genuinely legal, democratic and enlightened State\nwhich will not fail to take a worthy place among the\ncivilized countries of the world.\n"

        "file_text": " In 1965 three of\nthe Caribbean\u2019s most outstanding statesmen created an\ninstitution to foster cooperation and to quicken the pace of\ntheir countries\u2019 development. Errol Barrow of Barbados,\nForbes Burnham of Guyana and V.C. Bird of Antigua and\nBarbuda met at Dickenson Bay, Antigua. There, they signed\na historic document creating the Caribbean Free Trade\nAssociation (CARIFTA).\nAlthough the three countries they led were not yet\nsovereign States, those enlightened statesmen envisioned the\nemergence of an independent, English-speaking Caribbean\ncapable of playing a meaningful role in international affairs.\nThe entire Caribbean, beginning in 1492 and continuing\nthroughout its modern history, had been an object of\ninternational intrigue and international competition. How\nfitting, then, for that region to help shape world history once\nit had taken hold of its own ambitions and aspirations.\nIn 1973, CARIFTA was transformed into a more\nextensive institution called the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM). Today, exactly 20 years after its\nestablishment, all citizens of the 13 countries of CARICOM,\nwhether living in the Caribbean or in the diaspora, celebrate\nthis historic moment when a most able son of Guyana is\nelected to preside over the forty-eighth session of the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.\nYour brilliant academic career, your outstanding\ndiplomatic skills and your warm, personable style of\nleadership assured your unanimous election. Antiguans and\nBarbudans rejoice with you and your country, and my\ndelegation pledges its fullest support and cooperation.\nMy delegation is appreciative of the role played by the\nnon-English-speaking countries that are members of the\nLatin American and Caribbean Group of States, whose full\nsupport was necessary to achieve this noble objective. The\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n33 States of the region have quietly made tremendous\nprogress, in this and other forums, in strengthening the\nbonds of cooperation and friendship that bind us. And\nthough we are divided on a single but important trade issue,\nwe expect that an amicable solution will shortly be found to\nthe satisfaction of both sides.\nDuring the past year, our regional group of States\nworked together to find a solution to the Haitian crisis. The\ndelegations of Brazil and Venezuela, regional members of\nthe Security Council, made every attempt to include the\nentire region in the Council\u2019s decision-making process as it\npertained to Haiti, another regional member. The United\nStates must also be congratulated in that regard.\nThe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean now\neagerly await the return of President Aristide to Haiti on 30\nOctober three weeks from today, when history will reverse\nitself. Despite the violence and the dilatory tactics employed\nby the military leaders in Haiti, Antigua and Barbuda is\nconfident that the forces of good will, decency and\ndemocracy will prevail.\nI wish to point out that no previous Security Council\nembargo intended to compel compliance with the will of the\ninternational community was ever as swiftly effective as was\nthe embargo imposed on the illegitimate regime in Haiti.\nMy delegation regards this episode as a turning-point in the\nhistory of Security Council actions to safeguard international\npeace and security.\nThreats to international peace and security, up until the\nSecurity Council action on Haiti, have been narrowly defined\nas the use of force by one sovereign State against another,\nor some form of violent confrontation between or among\nStates. A small State like mine, incapable of waging war\nand no longer an object of conquest, defines international\npeace and security more broadly.\nGrinding poverty and the resultant ecological disaster\nwhich characterize Haiti are threats to the peace and security\nof that sovereign State and its neighbours. Not force, not\nviolent threats, but poverty and its attendant consequences\nthreaten international peace and security. Antigua and\nBarbuda, a small island State and an ally of democracy and\nlegitimacy in the Americas and certainly in this forum, takes\ngreat pride in knowing that all of CARICOM pressed this\ncause here at the United Nations and elsewhere and that\nHaiti can count on us never to relent.\nAntigua and Barbuda will never relent in its struggle\nagainst illegal drug trafficking, either. Located between the\nsuppliers of the South and the markets of the North, we have\nbeen thrust by geography into the battle against this scourge.\nWe pledge our slender resources in the global struggle\nagainst this global enemy.\nApartheid, another global enemy, is in its death throes.\nMy small country takes pride in knowing that our voice has\nhelped to topple that evil system in South Africa. From the\nmoment of our independence 12 years ago, in 1981, my\nsmall country has supported the legitimate aspirations of\noppressed peoples everywhere, but especially those of the\nmajority population in South Africa.\nIn April of next year, when democratic elections are\nheld to choose a representative government in South Africa,\nAntigua and Barbuda will also be able to celebrate a victory\nof right over wrong, of democratic ideals over dictatorship,\nof good over evil. The international community must begin\npreparing to come to the assistance of an anaemic South\nAfrica whose need for economic good health in a\npost-apartheid world is even now apparent.\nIn April of next year, as apartheid suffers its final\ndefeat, the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States will convene\nin Barbados. This Conference is the first test of the will of\nthe international community since the Earth Summit\nconvened in Rio last June. You will recall, Mr. President,\nthat the most significant conclusion of last year\u2019s Earth\nSummit was the determination that industrial civilization is\nfundamentally flawed.\nDevelopment based on the current model of\nconsumption, distribution and disposal practised by the\ndeveloped world is unsustainable. Abundant quantities of\nharmful gases and toxins, emitted into the atmosphere, are\naltering our global environment, and fatal consequences have\nbeen forecast for the Earth\u2019s climate, its biodiverse flora and\nfauna, its agriculture, all living animals and human health\nand well-being.\nIt should be borne in mind that while the contribution\nby small island States to climate change, global warming and\nsea-level rise is zero, the effects of climate change, global\nwarming and sea-level rise will reduce small island States\nlike mine to zero. Our very existence is at stake; our peace\nand security are threatened by the actions of large and\nwealthy States whose presumptions about the Earth\u2019s\nresources need to be completely revised.\nThe Barbados Conference will articulate a programme\nof action intended to eliminate these man-induced, looming\ncatastrophes and to achieve sustainable development\nbeginning in small island States. The international\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 13\ncommunity\u2019s support and good will are required if\nsustainable development is to be made real and disaster is to\nbe prevented.\nSmall island States are the foot-soldiers in this battle to\nsave the planet. We will be the first casualties but we will\nnot be the last if drastic changes are not quickly brought\nabout in the developed world.\nOn Earth\u2019s last uninhabited continent, disaster can also\nbe avoided. Antarctica, a pristine and icy wilderness whose\nwaters abound with the most significant link in the oceans\u2019\nfood chain, whose winds control the earth\u2019s weather systems,\nwhose tundras conceal the secrets of the Earth\u2019s past, and\nwhose icebergs determine sea-levels world wide, must never\nbecome the possession of large States alone. Antigua and\nBarbuda will never acknowledge sovereignty over Antarctica\nby any State.\nIn fact, working alongside like-minded delegations, we\nwill continue to press for a mining and oil exploration ban\nin perpetuity, certain that any other arrangement will lead to\na precipitation of ecological decline worldwide, to the\ndetriment of small island States among others. In our view,\nAntarctica must be declared a world park, control over\nwhich should be exercised by our world body.\nThe world\u2019s many peoples must learn to live in\nharmony with the Earth\u2019s environment and peaceably among\nourselves. Ethnic strife and wars have taken more lives in\nthe last year than comprise the entire population of my\ncountry and several other CARICOM States combined. All\nmultiracial and multi-ethnic societies must learn to settle\nhistoric and current rivalries peacefully; when they fail to do\nso, resources which could well be spent on development are\nnecessarily diverted to peace-keeping.\nThe peace-keeping missions now undertaken by the\nUnited Nations cost more than $3.5 billion annually; as a\nconsequence, development assistance is severely restricted.\nPeaceful States like mine therefore have an economic\ninterest in seeing a decline in the need for peace-keeping.\nSadly, it is anticipated that more civil strife and many more\nethnic and religious conflicts will occur in the near future\nand that the United Nations will be called on to help.\nMy delegation therefore applauds Liechtenstein for the\nrole it has decided to play in this forum. That small\nEuropean State is attempting to find a structured solution to\nthe unyielding demand by rival groups within States for a\nmeasure of self-determination. The size of a country bears\nno relation to the intellectual capacity of its statesmen or to\nits capacity for generating great ideas. Antigua and Barbuda\nwill work alongside this small State in promoting a\npermanent solution to destructive ethnic conflicts within\nStates.\nThe world\u2019s indigenous peoples must also find\npermanent protection, and the injustices they have long\nendured must also quickly cease. Towards that end, our\nUnited Nations declared 1993 the International Year of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People. It is not yet clear just how\nmuch impact the declaration has had; a fund has been\nestablished in the Americas to support the indigenous\npeoples of my region, and Brazil and Venezuela have shown\ncourage in their support for the Yanomami, an Amazonian\nforest people.\nAntigua and Barbuda also supports the establishment of\nan annual International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous\nPeople. Having lost the indigenous Arawaks and Caribs of\nAntigua and Barbuda, beginning in 1492, my country is\nduty-bound to ensure that powerless indigenous people the\nworld over, who have inhabited the lands of their ancestors\nfor many generations, are adequately remembered and\nprotected by our United Nations.\nThe people of Antigua and Barbuda condemn the\nperpetrators of the fierce conflict which continues to rage in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and we deplore the attacks on\nUnited Nations peace-keepers in Somalia as much as we\nabhor the destructive campaign waged by mercenaries in\nAngola. The civil wars in Liberia and Mozambique are\nbrutish and unyielding, and the civil strife which has erupted\nin Georgia will likely match both in ferocity and\ndestructiveness.\nIn the Middle East, the slow trickle of peace has turned\ninto a gushing stream with many tributaries. It is our hope\nthat the Israelis and until the Palestinians will be able to find\nthe source of a lasting flow of peace. Until Israel is allowed\nto exist within secure borders and until the Palestinians\nachieve a sovereign State of their own, peace in that region\nmay slowly evaporate.\nWe rejoice at the wave of peace which has engulfed\nLebanon. Its very industrious citizens, flung far and wide by\na conflict that seemed unending, can now give back to their\nhomeland some of the talent and wealth which their rich\nculture bestowed upon them. Lebanon can surely count on\nits prodigious sons and daughters in the diaspora for every\nassistance; their generosity is as legendary as their love for\ntheir old country.\nWe welcome the finalization of the demarcation of the\nboundary between Kuwait and Iraq which was accomplished\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nby the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Commission in May 1993.\nWe also welcome the adoption by the Security Council of\nresolution 833 (1993) in which it guaranteed the inviolability\nof the boundary between the two States. This guarantee\nshall serve as a deterrent against future conflict between\nthese two neighbours while enhancing stability and security\nin the region.\nMy people celebrate with the countries of the Central\nAmerican region as peace rains down upon them. If future\ncivil wars are to be prevented, however, the economic\nsystems which prevail in Central America must become far\nmore inclusive. In distributing wealth, methods must be\nfound to direct more than a trickle towards the poor.\nWe note that the impoverishment of Cuba\u2019s people is\ndue overwhelmingly to exogenous circumstances, and so our\nsympathies lie with the people of this sister Caribbean State.\nIn the early decades of this century, Cubans welcomed poor\nworkers from neighbouring Antigua to their shores. Today,\nstanding in solidarity with the Cuban people, Antiguans and\nBarbudans seek a speedy end to their suffering.\nI would be remiss in my duty, as I conclude, if I did\nnot convey to the outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, the gratitude of my delegation for the important\nrole he played during the preceding session of the General\nAssembly. It was under his watch that six new Members\njoined our Organization. I welcome to membership the\nCzech Republic, the Republic of Slovakia, Eritrea, Monaco,\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Andorra.\nTheir presence greatly enhances our institution\u2019s legitimate\nclaim of universality, as membership climbs to 184.\nIn that regard, my delegation would note that Antigua\nand Barbuda supports a manageable enlargement of the\nSecurity Council to reflect the new realities. However, our\ndelegation will not join any consensus on enlargement if the\nqualifying criteria for new membership implicitly require a\ncertain level of wealth and/or a certain population size.\nAlthough we harbour no ambitions to sit on the Security\nCouncil, my small country cannot agree to be excluded from\nthe Council in perpetuity. Such exclusion would make us\nless sovereign than larger States.\nThe moral conscience of our institution can best be\narticulated frequently by small States with no material\ninterest in the outcome of disputes. But even more\nimportant is the fact that our own survival requires us to\ncontribute to the construction of a new world order that will\nhave its basis in Security Council decision-making. We\nwish merely to retain our option, for we know not what\nfuture generations will encounter.\nMy delegation concludes by recalling that on 31 March\n1918 - 75 years ago - another generation of Antiguans and\nBarbudans challenged an unconscionable system of\nexploitation that left us materially impoverished. Our\ngrandmothers and grandfathers, then youthful and vigorous,\nwere determined to fashion for themselves and their progeny\na future that would be superior to their own inheritance. In\n1918, brutality was the response to their legitimate cry for\nworkers\u2019 rights.\nTwenty years later - in 1938 - a sympathetic\nCommission was to determine that the deplorable conditions\nthen extant in my country required massive infusions of\npublic finance and good will in order to achieve a marked\nturn-around. When, in 1943 - 50 years ago, and 25 years\nafter the 1918 revolt - a nationalist named V. C. Bird picked\nup the mantle of leadership of the workers\u2019 organization, my\nsmall country began its metamorphosis in earnest.\nSeventy-five years after March 1918, the Antigua and\nBarbuda that has evolved bears no resemblance to the\nAntigua and Barbuda that history left behind. When\nV. C. Bird and his trade-union colleagues quickened our\nstride towards freedom and an improved material condition,\nbeginning in 1943, they had a vision of an Antigua and\nBarbuda which, 50 years later, has become virtual reality.\nAs V. C. Bird and his generation pass the mantle of\nleadership to their successor generation, our old men have\nvisions, and our young women have dreams. Antiguans and\nBarbudans are aware that there are detractors abroad who\nmay wish to see our freedom snatched from us. We have\npaid a price for our freedom, which we will for ever defend.\nAnd we are aware of the role played by the United Nations\nand international law in safeguarding the sovereignty of\nsmall States.\nWe shall therefore for ever remain wedded to\nmultilateral institutions like the Caribbean Community, the\nOrganization of East Caribbean States, the Organization of\nAmerican States, the Commonwealth and this body - the\nUnited Nations - which, together, strengthen our sovereignty.\nMultilateralism is the greatest ally of our freedom, and the\nUnited Nations the greatest guarantor.\nAs Antiguans and Barbudans recall the courage of the\nheroes of 1918, we pledge never again - never again - to\nallow injustice and brute force to raise their ugly heads in\nour beautiful, beloved Antigua and Barbuda. My generation\nwill continue to do all that is necessary to bequeath to future\ngenerations a peaceful legacy, where justice rules, ignorance\nis banished, and legitimate leadership springs from the\npeople\u2019s choice. That is our pledge.\n"

        "file_text": "The United Nations has embarked on an irreversible process\nof profound transformation. Efficiency and flexibility will\nbe the defining features of this process. But an effective\nUnited Nations must continue to be in the service of peace\nand development.\nThe United Nations of the next century must not be a\nmechanism, however efficient, for balancing the interests of\nthe most powerful. The Organization must move ahead as\nthe world\u2019s primary instrument for promoting development\nand solidarity among nations and among men.\nOur Organization is first and foremost a body of\nsovereign nations. It does not and cannot have any other\nwill than that expressed here by Member States. The drastic\nincrease in the number of Members over the last four years,\nsomething that had not been seen since the days of\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ndecolonization, underscores this characteristic and is also\nproof of the confidence that we States place in the United\nNations.\nThis community of nations now wishes to\ninternationalize certain issues which in earlier times fell\nexclusively within the internal jurisdiction of States.\nMexico, as a country aware of its international\nresponsibilities, is acting within the requirements of the new\nconsensuses. But we must repeat time and again that we\nreject the idea of international action developing to the\ndetriment of national sovereignty.\nAll the peoples represented here must participate in\nforging the Organization of the future. Mexico sees in any\nreforms a historic opportunity to strengthen the democratic\nlife of this Organization.\nThe question of equitable representation in the Security\nCouncil plays a central role in the reform of our\nOrganization. There is a consensus on the need to increase\nthe number of seats in the Council. Whereas in 1945 there\nwere 51 Members of the United Nations, today there are 184\nof us. For this reason, we should perhaps try, at the very\nleast, to double the number of seats in the Council. But\nsimply increasing the membership would not be enough.\nThe restructuring of the Council must take into account,\nfirst of all, the fact that the Council lacks authority of its\nown. It acts by the mandate of those of us who have\ndecided, as sovereign States, to delegate our authority to it\nfor the delicate task of maintaining world peace. The\nquestion of the Council\u2019s composition must be addressed\nhaving regard to the overriding need to guarantee the\nlegitimacy and transparency of the Council\u2019s actions.\nThose who make the greatest contributions to the\nmaintenance of peace, not necessarily those who are the\nlargest producers and exporters of the world\u2019s weapons,\nshould be members of the Council. Carrying out peace-\nkeeping operations is not simply a question of placing\nmilitary contingents at the Council\u2019s disposition. We must\nrecognize the efforts of all those countries which have\nbrought about the peaceful settlement of international\ndisputes. The recent frequent recourse to the Security\nCouncil has tended to hide the fact that our first obligation\nis to resolve differences by peaceful means.\nA representative body must be democratic. The right\nof veto is not democratic, and therefore Mexico has never\nsupported it. Together, we must seek new ways to control\nthe exercise of that right and ensure that no permanent\nmember alone can decide or obstruct the Council\u2019s action.\nTransparency in the working methods of the Council\nwill restore to the General Assembly the primacy derived\nfrom its universality and pluralism. We propose that a\nGeneral Assembly working group be established to make\nrecommendations on all aspects of the Security Council\u2019s\nreform.\nIn recent years peace-keeping operations have increased\nconsiderably. This shows that the world has not yet\nmanaged to resolve its most pressing problems.\nNationalisms persist. Xenophobia and racism are on\nthe rise. Extreme poverty has increased.\nMexico sees peace-keeping operations as an excellent\ninstrument for containing the effects of conflict situations.\nSuch operations exist to create the conditions for a political\nsolution to be reached by peaceful means. They are an\nopportunity for peace, but they are not peace itself.\nBefore the Security Council decides to set up a peace-\nkeeping operation, all parties to the conflict must have given\ntheir consent. Only in this way can we guarantee the\ninviolability of the sovereign rights of States and respect for\ntheir internal jurisdiction.\nA clear mandate is also indispensable. Precisely\nbecause their functions have become diversified, the Blue\nHelmets must have clearly delimited fields of activity. My\nGovernment is concerned that the scope of activity of the\nmembers of those forces can be widened in situ, and that\ntheir areas of competence are confused with other collective\nactions based on the enforcement measures outlined in\nChapter VII of the Charter.\nIn Somalia United Nations forces should only ensure\nthat the international humanitarian aid reaches its intended\nbeneficiaries. The international community\u2019s support for\npeace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief depends on\ntheir impartiality and transparency.\nMexico makes an urgent appeal to Member States\nimmediately to lay down parameters regulating all aspects of\nthe establishment and functioning of peace-keeping\noperations.\nNo force can replace political will in finding solutions\nto international conflicts. This is demonstrated by the\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 19\nagreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organization\nand the State of Israel regarding autonomy for the occupied\nterritories. Mexico congratulates both the parties involved,\nas well as those who assisted them in this great success of\npolitical intelligence, of concertation and respect for the\nrights of the other side. Weapons are yielding to the rule of\nreason. The self-determination of peoples and the right of\nevery State to live within secure and recognized boundaries -\nprinciples to which Mexico has always subscribed - are\nbeginning to gain strength in the Middle East.\nIn contrast to the signs of hope we are seeing in the\nMiddle East, the failure of the efforts to bring peace to the\nformer Yugoslavia is clear. Peace plans come and go, but\nthere has been no end to the killing and suffering of\ninnocent people. Mexico urges all the parties to the conflict\nto agree on concrete confidence-building measures which\nwill allow the conditions for a broad, lasting agreement to be\ncreated.\nMexico welcomes the recent decision by the United\nStates, France, the United Kingdom and Russia unilaterally\nto extend the moratorium on nuclear testing. This decision\nwill make it possible for the Conference on Disarmament\nfinally to begin negotiations to ratify a treaty completely\nbanning these tests. We hope that all the nuclear Powers,\nincluding China, will join the moratorium.\nThis historic decision, inspired and encouraged from the\nbeginning by my country, will be a vital step in preventing\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mexico stresses the\npriority of the negotiations, both on their own merits and\nbecause of the effect they will have on the next Non-\nProliferation Treaty Review Conference, which will\ndetermine the future of this important international\ninstrument. For Mexico, the complete cessation of nuclear\ntests is inextricably linked to the fate of the non-proliferation\nregime.\nThe community of nations must now confront another\ndanger: drugs. Now the largest illegal business in history,\nthey are putting an end to human lives, corrupting the forces\nof order and harming political institutions, and they can even\naffect the stability of States.\nWe cannot question the merit of the United Nations\nConvention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances, an instrument which has served to\nguide State policies and coordinate international cooperation.\nCertain local and national battles have been won as a result\nof them. But the war has not been won, and it is now a\nworld war.\nIn view of the uncontrollable spread throughout the\nworld of the dirty business of drugs, of their consumption,\nproduction and traffic, and all the related illegal activities,\nwe must give thought to the ineffectiveness of the strategies\nwe have followed, and we must adopt a new course. We\nmust intensify our political determination, imagination and\nstrategic creativity and, above all, international cooperation\nin which there is respect for sovereignty and no one claims\npreeminence, in order to stop the growth of this terrible\nsocial cancer.\nAnother central issue of our times is the great migratory\ncurrents which are developing with renewed vigour as the\ncentury draws to a close. The great international migrations\nare a result of the polarization of wealth and well-being.\nThey are a problem which affects the entire world,\nexceeding the capacity for action of individual States. We\nneed new plans for international cooperation to seek\nsolutions to the most distressing problems relating to\neconomic underdevelopment.\nEvery wave of migration throughout history has its own\nexplanations, and the explanations are not necessarily related.\nHowever, they always include the search for a better life.\nChanges in the world\u2019s structure are both a brake on\nmigration and an encouragement. In 1989, 1 per cent of the\nworld\u2019s population - more than 50 million people - lived\noutside their country of origin. In 1992, only three years\nlater, this figure had doubled. At the beginning of the\n1990s, the number of refugees in the world had reached 17\nmillion.\nThose countries which, because of their economic\ndevelopment and social peace, seem to be able to accept new\ngroups of migrants are today undergoing internal conflicts at\ntimes expressed through manifestations of ethnic and\nreligious intolerance.\nDuring this period of difficult transition towards a new\nordering of power and balance in the world, internal\ntensions, protectionist tendencies, the global recession and\nthe disintegration of numerous States have combined to\nmake certain countries perceive the phenomenon of\nmigration as a threat to their national security.\nLet us keep this phenomenon from overwhelming us by\nadopting restrictive measures that are only superficial\npalliatives.\nMexico proposes that the Assembly begin serious\nthought on this subject as soon as possible.\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe national plans of any State must be based on\npolicies which make it possible for the inhabitants to live in\na dignified manner in their own country. Only in this way\ncan we ensure that whole peoples will not try to leave in\nsearch of better economic opportunities. Extreme poverty\nhas increased in all areas of the world. For as long as the\nrichest one fifth of the world\u2019s population represents 83 per\ncent of total income, we will have failed in our efforts at\neconomic cooperation.\nThe countries of Latin America and those of Central\nand Eastern Europe have made special efforts to make\ninternal adjustments to bring about economic reforms that\nwould have been hard even to imagine a few years ago. The\nproblem of critical poverty, however, cannot be left to the\nwhim of market forces. In Mexico the State has not\nabdicated its social responsibility. Indeed, we have\nstrengthened our development policies based on solidarity.\nPresident Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said, time and\ntime again, that in order to consolidate any programme of\nadjustment and economic stability, the promotion of social\nprogrammes is indispensable. He has also stressed that the\nexpansion, modernization and proper orientation of\neducational programmes was the only way, in the long term,\nto increase productivity and raise the living standards of the\npeople.\nThe convening of the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment in 1995 shows that the United Nations has\nacknowledged the priority nature of this item on the\ninternational agenda. Mexico is already participating with\nenthusiasm in preparations for this important event.\nIn the course of this year the World Conference on\nHuman Rights was held at Vienna. The agreements reached\nmust lead to a strengthening of already existing legal\ninstruments. The community of States participating in the\nConference expressed their political determination to\nimplement these agreements in a non-selective manner, with\nobjectivity and respect for universality. This is a\nfundamental aspect of the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights throughout the world. Mexico would repeat\nbefore the Assembly that full respect for human rights\nrequires us to direct our efforts towards the weakest groups:\nthose that live in conditions of poverty, refugees, ethnic\nminorities, and all those people in need of respect for their\nway of life and their culture.\nMexico\u2019s total trade with the United States of America\nand Canada is equivalent to 20 per cent of its gross national\nproduct. For this reason it signed the North American Free\nTrade Agreement and parallel agreements. On that basis we\nhope to promote, regulate and ensure trade flows, services\nand investments among these three countries. In due course\nthis will be the largest free-trade area in the world: 360\nmillion people with a product worth $7 trillion, a moving\nforce of principal importance for the world economy.\nBut Mexico is also a substantial and proud part of Latin\nAmerica. We have our cultural links and historic alliances\nin Latin America. We give priority to our cooperation with\nCentral America and with the countries of the Caribbean.\nWe participate actively in the Rio Group and in the Latin\nAmerican Economic System (SELA). We, together with\nColombia and Venezuela, are involved in negotiations on\nfree trade with the Group of Three, and we hope that these\nwill be completed this year. With Chile we already have an\nagreement which has been in existence since January 1992.\nWe are also having talks with other countries in the area.\nWe participate actively in the Ibero-American\nConference, which is gaining the kind of standing that befits\nan organization of 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking\ncountries in America and Europe.\nAs an Atlantic country we feel very close to Europe,\nwhere we have our principal partners and friends. We feel\nespecially close to the European Community, with which we\nhave a standing dialogue.\nWe are also a Pacific country and have significantly\nexpanded the number of our representatives and our trade\nwith Asian countries. We appreciate the support that has\nbeen given to us by the countries of the Asia Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation Council to help us to enter that body\nvery soon.\nWe have also been invited by the 24 countries of the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD). We appreciate the invitation. We are working out\nthe details of our entry into this prestigious group.\nWe congratulate the leaders of South Africa, President\nDe Klerk and Nelson Mandela, on the agreements that they\nhave reached and we are ready immediately to initiate full\nrelations with that Republic.\nWe recognize and fully support the efforts that have\nbeen made in Haiti. Our Ambassador has now returned to\nPort au Prince. We reiterate our offer to the Secretary-\nGeneral to give technical and economic resources for the\ngeneral recovery of Haiti.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 21\nWe wish to continue to be respectful friends of each\nand every one of the States that are Members of the United\nNations.\nThe central strategy of the foreign policies of President\nCarlos Salinas de Gortari are diversification and the\ndeepening of our relations with all regions and countries of\nthe world.\nMexico has already begun preparations for the\ncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United\nNations. In my country this will not be an occasion for\nmeaningless celebrations and self-congratulatory gestures.\nWe are making a serious effort to give serious thought to the\nfuture of the Organization. The first question that we must\nanswer, however, is: What functions do we want the United\nNations to perform in the coming century? All the rest will\nfollow by accretion.\nIf in truth we have an opportunity - as has so often\nbeen said since the end of the cold war - to turn the\nOrganization into the cornerstone of a truly new, more just\ninternational order, then let us take action.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like to begin my statement by expressing my most\nsincere condolences to the victims of the terrible disaster\nwhich has taken place in India and to the Indian population.\nPlease allow me first of all to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your election to your important office. I\nknow that your many years of experience as your country\u2019s\nPermanent Representative at the United Nations and your\nuniversally admired expertise will greatly enhance the\ndeliberations of this body.\nSince the Gulf War the United Nations - whether in\nmediating among warring factions or in saving lives in\nwar-torn areas - has been more than ever at the centre of\nworld politics, with its tireless struggle for sustainable\ndevelopment, its daily fight to protect human rights and its\nactive peace-keeping. In Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the\ninternational community has a United Nations\nSecretary-General committed to the difficult task of adapting\nthe Organization to a much-altered world political climate\nand of strengthening it to face the new challenges ahead. I\nhave great respect for his incisive judgement and tireless\nservice which provided us with his visionary report \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\".\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s first official visit to Austria\nlast June gave us an opportunity to discuss the most pressing\nchallenges facing the United Nations in the post-communist\nera. They have special importance for Vienna as one of the\nthree official seats of the Organization. We would like to\nsee an Organization whose structure, management and\nfinancing enable it to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to\nit in the Charter. In this context we have taken note with\nsatisfaction of the Secretary-General\u2019s assurance to\nstrengthen the United Nations Office at Vienna.\nOne of the United Nation\u2019s most important tasks is to\nsafeguard human rights. The Organization\u2019s international\nefforts in this area have saved human lives, brought about\nthe release of prisoners, prevented torture, helped to locate\nmissing persons, promoted health and literacy programmes\nand safeguarded the rights of displaced persons and refugees.\nIn June this year my country had the honour to host\nthousands of delegates and representatives of\nnon-governmental organizations in Vienna at one of the most\nsignificant events in this field: the World Conference on\nHuman Rights.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank once\nagain all participants for their constructive cooperation and\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncommitment and for their valuable support they gave me as\nPresident of the Conference. It was the active collaboration\nof the participating States and the effective support of the\nUnited Nations Secretariat, under the Assistant\nSecretary-General Fall, that made the Conference such a\nresounding success, one that would not have been possible\nwithout the committed participation of the non-governmental\norganizations, which sent more than 2,700 representatives to\nthe World Conference. Never before have so many\nhuman-rights organizations been involved to such an extent,\nat all levels, in the events of such a major international\nConference as was the case at Vienna.\nWith the final document of the Conference, the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, the international\ncommunity has adopted a document of major significance.\nIt is a forward-looking, action-based platform, which not\nonly strengthens basic principles but also represents an\nimportant advance in the protection of human rights - all\nhuman rights - world wide. The document affirms the\nuniversal character of human rights and the principle that the\nprotection of human rights is a legitimate concern not only\nof individuals and States but also of the entire international\ncommunity. It establishes a link between human rights,\ndemocracy and development and underscores the special\nresponsibility of States to take concerted measures to protect\nparticularly vulnerable groups in society. It calls for a\nstrengthening of the United Nations Human Rights Centre\nand for increasing its resources so that it can effectively\nmeet rising demands.\nWhen the report of the World Conference comes up for\ndiscussion before the General Assembly in the weeks ahead,\nwe must do more than complacently acknowledge its\naccomplishments. The results of the World Conference\nshould be translated into concrete action in all areas, from\nthe rights of women and children to the integration of the\nhandicapped, the plight of indigenous peoples and the rights\nof minorities to the right to development. Such new\nelements as a High Commissioner for Human Rights or a\nDecade for Human Rights must also be among the decisions\nof this session of the General Assembly. Without\nunderemphasizing other elements of the Conference\u2019s\noutcome, I note that the recommendation to create an office\nof High Commissioner for Human Rights has been\nhighlighted by some eminent speakers, among them United\nStates President Clinton, the Foreign Minister of the Russian\nFederation, Mr. Kozyrev, and the Norwegian Prime Minister,\nMrs. Brundtland.\nAround the world, we are coming to realize that active\nprotection of minorities is an elementary part of the political\nand social stability of the countries in which they live, an\ninsurance against regional conflicts. In this spirit, the States\nmeeting at Vienna reaffirmed their commitment to the\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National\nor Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted at the\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nAs a major media event, the Conference also\ncontributed greatly to sensitizing the public around the world\nto the issue of human rights. In Vienna the human\ndimension - or, as the United Nations Secretary-General so\nfittingly called it, the \\\"irreducible human element\\\" - found\na firm place on the international political agenda. This has\ngiven rise to great expectation among our citizenry and in all\nof us. It is incumbent upon the members of the international\ncommunity to keep the promises made in the Vienna\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, for, in the end, the\nsuccess of the Vienna Human Rights Conference will be\nmeasured by whether it was able to reverse the general trend\nand build communities which provide the individual with a\ndecent human existence complete with civil, political,\neconomic, social and cultural rights. We have here goals\nthat will have a global impact on the evolution of humanity,\neven if their implementation is only in the incipient stage.\nIn the past 12 months the situation in the Balkans has\ndeteriorated dramatically. The tireless efforts of the\nSecretary-General and the peace mediators in Geneva have\nnot yet been able to end the fighting or bring about concrete\nprospects for a just and peaceful solution in keeping with the\nvalues enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in the\nNovember 1990 Paris Charter. Despite tremendous\nachievements by the High Commissioner for Refugees and\nother humanitarian organizations, and the many thousands of\ntroops in the service of the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR), the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continues\nto claim thousands of lives.\nThus far over 200,000 people have been killed, and\nanother 2 million have been driven from their homes or\nforced to flee. Entire towns and districts lie in ruins.\nSeveral cities have been declared safe areas by the United\nNations, but life within them has still not returned to normal.\nAlthough the violation of the independence and territorial\nintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and of human rights by\nthe Serbian side, was condemned by the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as early as\nApril of last year, and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" has come under the\nharshest criticism in the world community, there has still\nbeen no progress in halting that abominable practice. The\nmost serious violations of human rights continue to be the\norder of the day. In the meantime, there is already evidence\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 9\nthat the cruel methods used by the aggressor have been\nemulated by the victims. Austria has condemned this\ncriminal behaviour in the strongest terms and will tirelessly\ncontinue to demand that it cease, no matter where it takes\nplace or who its victims are.\nFundamental principles of international order, as they\nwere precisely defined and affirmed at the London\nConference in August last year, continue to be grossly\ndisregarded. Specific resolutions, such as the monitoring of\nfrontiers between Bosnia and Serbia or the return of\nrefugees, have still not been implemented. The arms\nembargo decreed by the Security Council in September 1991\nhas done nothing but hurt the victims of aggression. As a\nresult, the legitimate Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nis in effect being hindered from fully exercising its right to\nself-defence, under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter,\nwithout being afforded adequate protection within the\nframework of a collective security system.\nAgainst this backdrop, the proposed peace plans under\ndiscussion at the negotiations in Geneva raise a number of\nfundamental issues. In tenor, they all call for recognizing a\nstatus quo established by the use of violence and against all\nprinciples and declarations. This fact makes the spread or\nprolongation of the conflict likely. There is even the danger\nthat Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member of the United\nNations, will be divided up in a move sanctioned - even\nencouraged - by the international community. This would\nlend formal legitimacy to advantages gained by force. The\nmost recently proposed partition plan for the country would\nseriously undercut its sovereignty by eliminating any\neffective central authority, in flagrant contradiction of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s renewed expression of support for the\nsovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 August this\nyear.\nThis continuing violation of international law, human\nrights and humanitarian law puts fundamental principles of\ninternational conduct in jeopardy while seriously\nundermining the reputation of the international organizations\ninvolved. The failure of the system of collective security is\nespecially alarming in this regard.\nThe same can be said for the situation in Croatia. Over\na fourth of the country remains in the hands of the\naggressor, contrary to the Cyrus Vance plan of\nJanuary 1992, which was endorsed by the Security Council.\nNeither the demilitarization of these areas to be monitored\nby United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops,\nnor the return of the civilian populations that have been\nexpelled, has yet been realized. Just a few weeks ago the\ncapital of Croatia was shelled by ground-to-ground missiles\nfired from areas ostensibly under UNPROFOR protection.\nCurrently overshadowed by the war in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the situation in Kosovo remains tense. A\nrational solution is nowhere in sight. If anything, the\nlikelihood of an outbreak of violence has increased in recent\ndays. The expulsion of the long-term missions of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\nin July of this year could well lay the groundwork for even\nmore brutal actions by Serbia against the Albanian\npopulation. All in all, we are confronted with a situation in\nwhich Serbia appears increasingly to be exercising the power\nof an occupier in a region whose population is almost\n90 per cent Albanian and which for decades has enjoyed\ncomplete autonomy. Austria stands fully behind the efforts\nof the international community to bring the Kosovo crisis\nunder control. In the end, a lasting peaceful solution to the\nBalkans problem is inconceivable without a just and\nequitable solution for Kosovo and for minorities in other\nregions.\nAustria is focusing its efforts on providing humanitarian\nrelief. Since the outbreak of the conflict, this relief has been\nhandled primarily by the large-scale private charity appeal\n\\\"Neighbours in Need\\\", which provides on-site aid for the\nneedy. Several other European countries are also involved\nin its activities. The Secretary-General\u2019s recent words of\npraise for its services are sure to inspire its organizers to\neven greater efforts. Austria, with a population of just\n7 million, is also caring for the needs of over 70,000\nrefugees on its own territory.\nThough the recent course of events in the former\nYugoslavia gives us little cause for optimism, the latest\ndevelopments in the Middle East fill us with renewed hope.\nAfter a period of stagnation, the peace process begun in\nMadrid in 1991 has been given a vital new impetus with the\nrecent agreement, on 13 September, between Israel and the\nPLO in Washington. However, the limited powers of\nself-government for the partitioned areas now agreed to are\nonly an initial step. The ultimate goal must be to achieve\nfull rights of self-determination for the Palestinians as part\nof a final settlement based on the relevant resolutions of the\nSecurity Council and other bodies of the Organization.\nThe pressing task now is to improve the difficult living\nconditions in the occupied territories through generous\neconomic and financial aid from the world community.\nAustria, which has always been committed to a peaceful\nsettlement in the Middle East, will maintain its support for\nthis cause by actively participating in the international\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nassistance measures now being planned. As part of the\nmultilateral negotiations, Austria will seek further ways to\nmake significant contributions in the areas of water and\nenergy resources.\nNevertheless, a lasting peace in the region will only be\nachieved when Israel and the Arab countries conclude\ntreaties based on the principles of land for peace, security\nand regional cooperation. From this standpoint, the\nagreement between Israel and Jordan on a framework\nagreement for peace is an encouraging sign, portending\nfurther progress, we hope, in the bilateral negotiations\nbetween Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon in the very\nnear future.\nWe very much welcome the remarkable success of the\nUnited Nations operation in Cambodia. The two\nco-Presidents of the Conference - France and Indonesia -\nJapan and Australia, as well as the permanent members of\nthe Security Council, have made an invaluable contribution\nto the peace process. We also particularly congratulate the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Akashi,\nand his colleagues, who have assured the success of the\noperation in the transitional phase.\nLast year I was pleased to announce in the General\nAssembly the official end to the dispute between Austria and\nItaly regarding the treatment of the German-speaking and\nLadin population of South Tyrol, a topic which was the\nsubject of United Nations resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661\n(XVI) and which had been pending before this international\nbody since 1960.\nA year later I can say that the autonomy established for\nthe German-speaking and Ladin population of South Tyrol\nappears to be effective in safeguarding the ethnic identity\nand the economic, social and cultural development of these\nethnic groups, though certain problems remain unresolved\nand new problems have arisen from the dynamics of\nevolution.\nThe settlement of this dispute in June last year has\nhelped to reduce tensions between the various ethnic groups.\nEven with this dispute settled, Austria would like to express\nits direct interest in helping solve new problems related to\nmatters involving South Tyrol. Given the new spirit in\nAustrian-Italian relations since the settlement of this dispute,\nI am confident we will be able to solve any matters relating\nto autonomy in a manner agreeable to all parties involved.\nThe East-West confrontation has now been replaced by\nan array of regional armed conflicts. There is an increasing\nneed for United Nations peace-keeping operations and\nincreasing demands are being placed on them. This trend\nhas accelerated in the past 12 months: almost\n80,000 soldiers, police, military observers and civilian\nexperts from 75 countries are now involved in the 17 United\nNations peace missions around the world.\nIn 1992 the costs for these United Nations missions\nsoared to $2.1 billion - twice the regular United Nations\nbudget - pushing the Organization to its limits under the\ncurrent financing arrangement. New approaches must be\nfound to finance these United Nations actions. The\nVolcker-Ogata report, \\\"Financing an Effective United\nNations\\\", points to financing options which could serve as a\nvaluable basis for the work of the Fifth Committee.\nThe most urgent challenges facing the United Nations\ntoday are to develop global collective peace-keeping efforts\nand to overcome the financial crisis. In his \\\"Agenda for\nPeace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\npeace-keeping\\\", the Secretary-General outlines possible\napproaches to active peace management by the United\nNations. It is now up to the Member States to give the\nSecretary-General the resources he needs to carry out his\nambitious plans. It is obvious that more security requires\ngreater solidarity and increased contributions, whether in the\nform of troops or of higher membership payments. Given\nthe current back payments still due, the first priority must be\nto motivate late payers to send in their contributions on time.\nAustria takes its obligations very seriously and is proud of\nhaving always fulfilled them on time.\nThe increasing consensus within the Security Council\nand its new decision-making capability have contributed to\nthe quantitative and qualitative expansion of peace-keeping\noperations and to an increasing variety of needs by the\ncommunity of nations for troops, officers, civilian police and\ncivilian experts. The purpose of the large-scale international\nmanoeuvres called \\\"Exercise 93\\\", recently conducted by the\nUnited Nations in Austria with great success, was to achieve\nthe optimum management and coordination of military and\ncivilian organizations in responding to disasters.\nAs things stand now, election assistance and\nmonitoring, the protection of human rights, disaster\nassistance, reconstruction aid, humanitarian relief and tasks\nof a similar nature are already considered integral parts of\nthe new United Nations peace operations, to be put into\neffect as soon as hostilities cease.\nAustria heartily welcomes this new development,\nhaving itself sent troops, military observers, police or\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 11\ncivilian experts to 12 of the 21 new United Nations\noperations since 1988. In keeping with the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", the Austrian\nFederal Government decided on 25 May of this year to lay\nthe necessary groundwork on a national level to put Austrian\nparticipation in United Nations peace operations on a new\nlegal footing. We will now be able to comply more quickly\nand efficiently with future requests by the United Nations\nand regional organizations and with the military, police and\ncivilian requirements they entail. To be more specific, there\nwill be an initial phase for the setting up of a disaster relief\nservice, a mechanism for seconding staff to the United\nNations Secretariat, a staff course for high-level officers,\npolice actions and humanitarian and disaster relief.\nAustria is especially interested in the civilian\ncomponents of peace-keeping operations. To this end, a\ntraining centre for civilian peace-keeping and peace-building\nhas been set up in Schlaining, Burgenland, with the support\nof the Federal Government. In September of this year the\nfirst fellowship programme devoted to \\\"peace-making and\npreventive diplomacy\\\" was held there, a programme\norganized by the United Nations Institute for Training and\nResearch (UNITAR); it was impressive in the quality of both\nits speakers and its participants. The successful International\nPeace Academy seminars on conflict resolution should also\nbe mentioned in this regard. In cooperation with the United\nNations, national and international experts will be trained in\nSchlaining in the civilian responsibilities of the United\nNations peace operations. Special emphasis will be placed\non the following tasks: sustainable development, the\nprotection of human rights and the rights of national and\nethnic minorities, humanitarian relief and the development of\ndemocracy.\nIn this age of interdependence, our efforts to secure\npeace globally and collectively cannot be limited to\npeace-keeping operations; they must also include economic\nand social developments. Hunger, underdevelopment,\npollution, crime, drug abuse and refugee flows all pose\nequally serious threats to global stability and thus to world\npeace. The increasingly global nature of these dangers\nrequires concerted international cooperation. The United\nNations is the ideal forum to engage in the quest for\nsustainable development, that is, development which is\ncompatible with ecological and social concerns. After all,\nthe United Nations mandate covers the full range of human\nexperience: political, economic, social and cultural.\nThe \\\"Agenda for the People\\\", as Secretary-General\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali so fittingly called it, is in fact the true\nchallenge facing the United Nations as the twentieth century\ndraws to a close. Large conferences such as those in Rio,\nVienna, Cairo, Beijing and Copenhagen should give global\nanswers to global issues. And no matter what the event - be\nit the Earth Summit, the Conference on Human Rights, the\nConference on Population and Development, the Conference\non Women or the World Social Conference - the focus\nshould always be on the individual human being and his or\nher development and membership in the community.\nIn his declaration of principle before this year\u2019s session\nof the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General\nunderscored the historic opportunity which the simultaneous\nstructural reform and redefinition of United Nations policy\noffer for the United Nations Member States. The crucial test\nfor the new United Nations will be the implementation of\nthis \\\"Agenda for the People\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, it is with great\npleasure that I congratulate you on your election as President\nof the General Assembly. This is not merely a recognition\nof your long experience and your outstanding ability and\ndiplomatic skill, but also a reflection of the esteem in which\nyour country, Guyana, is held in the United Nations. We are\ncertain that, under your able guidance, the work of this\nsession of the General Assembly will be a landmark in the\nnew international scene and in facing the new challenges for\npeace, democracy and progress.\nI should like also to pay a warm tribute to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for the determined leadership that he has\ndemonstrated on vital international issues and for his\nexcellent report on the work of the Organization, which\nprovides much food for thought and indicates various areas\nof important activities that are the object of soul-searching\nconsideration in this debate.\nMay I remind Members that, from the beginning of its\nexistence as an independent State after many years of\ncolonial rule until its admission to the United Nations in\n1960, Cyprus has consciously made the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter central to its foreign policy, and,\nwithin its limited possibilities, has endeavoured in every\npossible way to be supportive of the Organization.\nFrankly, I have to admit that we followed this approach\nin our foreign policy both as a matter of principle and as a\nmatter of self-interest. We have always believed that the\nUnited Nations was mankind\u2019s best hope for a system of\ninternational order, despite the fact that we were aware of\nthe possibilities of non-adherence to it and of the limitations\nto the effectiveness of the world Organization resulting from\nthe existence of military blocs. Our self-interest as a small\nand militarily weak country made us feel the need for the\nprotection of the world Organization, and, as a developing\ncountry, we stood to benefit from multilateral technical\nassistance and know-how.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s excellent report testifies to the\nfact that, in today\u2019s post-cold-war era, the United Nations is\nat a crossroads. Some years ago, in the context of the\nEast-West divide and the continuing build-up of nuclear\narsenals, we were agonizing in international forums over the\nfuture of our civilization. The cold war is finally over,\nopening up new prospects for positive change in\ninternational policies. New prospects are also opening up\nfor concerted action and a global approach to the problems\nwe face.\n\nIn some parts of the world, the old regimes have\ncollapsed and a move to pluralistic societies and the free\nmarket economy is being made. However, the newly\nacquired freedom has revived old enmities. This is not a\nstrange phenomenon because, as the eminent, late Prime\nMinister of India, Mr. Nehru, said, the walk to freedom is\nnot an easy one. World developments indicate, and clearly\ndemonstrate, that unless the international community adopts\na more unified approach in its understanding of the\nchallenges it faces and promotes the necessary solutions,\nhuman rights abuses, increasing insecurity and hunger and\nsuffering will create an explosive situation that will spare no\none; we are, though, gradually becoming aware of the\ncomplexity and scope that even minor issues acquire in an\ninterdependent world.\nThe world is full of challenges and opportunities. Our\ncommon responsibility is to strengthen the world\nOrganization in order best to respond to these challenges and\nincrease mankind\u2019s expectations of peace, prosperity and\ndemocracy. These expectations can be met only by making\nthe United Nations more effective, through the\nimplementation of its own resolutions and the mandatory\nprovisions of the Charter.\nThe General Assembly, based on the principle of\nsovereign equality, has much to offer and must continue to\nplay its important role under the Charter.\nNowadays, however, the Security Council has a\nsubstantially enlarged agenda. As the Charter envisages, it\nis able to decide and act. At present it is able to act in a\nmore effective manner in the crucial areas of international\npeace and security. It is evident that the Security Council\ncan now play a much more important role than ever before.\nThis is a welcome development, and within the context of\nthis expanded role a review of its membership to reflect the\nrealities of today\u2019s world is highly appropriate.\nHowever, the effectiveness of the Security Council, the\nhighest organ of the United Nations, can be achieved only if\nit applies the practice of acting with determination.\nExperience has demonstrated that in those cases where the\ninternational community has shown determination to uphold\nthe principles of international instruments and fully apply\ntheir provisions, progress can be made. In those cases where\nunity of purpose has not been shown or interests of nations\nhave been placed above universal principles and rule of law,\nthe problems remain, and peace is elusive.\nI wish to point out with emphasis that gaps in\ninternational law and practice - failure to uphold\ninternational law and human rights, or upholding them in\none situation and closing our eyes to their violation in others\n- must no longer be acceptable behaviour, particularly in the\nnew world order to which we all aspire.\nIn today\u2019s world, where economics plays an\nincreasingly important role, the United Nations, through the\nSecretariat, the United Nations Development Programme and\nthe various specialized agencies, carries out multi-purpose\nactivities for the betterment and economic well-being of\npeople throughout the world. These activities are outlined\nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report, and in the interest of\nsaving time I do not intend to comment on them other than\nto declare that we fully recognize their importance and\nsupport them. We look forward to receiving later in this\nsession the Secretary-General\u2019s integrated approach to\ndevelopment issues in his forthcoming agenda for\ndevelopment, which will no doubt appropriately complement\nhis groundbreaking \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" in matters of\npeace and security.\nIn the light of our overall philosophy, as I indicated\nearlier, we attach much importance to the effective\nfunctioning of the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations, the International Court of Justice. The increase of\nits jurisdiction in contentious cases is encouraging, and we\nalso attach importance to the possibility of clarifying legal\npoints in political disputes through advisory opinions. The\nInternational Court of Justice is indeed an integral part of\nUnited Nations peace efforts and we support the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposal that he be authorized to seek\nadvisory opinions from the Court as an important component\nof the United Nations peacemaking apparatus as a whole.\nThe Secretariat\u2019s role in an improved and more\neffective United Nations is indisputable, and we pay tribute\nto the many men and women in the international civil\nservice whose competence and dedication enable the\nOrganization to respond to the ever-increasing demands\nmade of it in today\u2019s world conditions. The\nSecretary-General has already done much in the direction of\nrationalizing and streamlining the Secretariat, as well as in\nputting in place effective machinery for inspections and\ninvestigations whenever necessary, and he certainly has our\nsupport in the additional measures needed to carry out this\nHerculean task. We join in recognizing the undoubted need\nfor an adequate financial basis for the Organization and for\nassessed contributions to be paid early and in full by\nMember States, in terms of both the regular budget and the\ncosts of peace-keeping. Voluntary contributions are also to\nbe encouraged in order to carry out the tasks at hand, and I\nmight recall that Cyprus, besides endeavouring to play its\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 3\nmodest role in as many such cases as its means allow, has\nalso undertaken to make, on a continuous basis, a major\ncontribution towards the financing of the United Nations\nPeace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).\nPast and recent experience in every region of the world\nhas demonstrated that the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights is an indispensable ingredient of a stable world\norder. Over the years the United Nations has played its full\npart in affirming human equality, which is, indeed, the heart\nof all rights, and in building bridges across the divides of\nrace, ethnicity, culture, socio-economic disparities and\npolitical philosophies. Democracy and human rights are two\nof the United Nations Charter\u2019s most cherished principles,\nand they have always figured prominently in United Nations\nconferences.\nDemocracy is the only system of government that can\nsafeguard the liberty of the people, respect for human rights\nand quality of life. We have a duty to remain vigilant and\ncontinue to look for ways in which these new opportunities\npresented by world developments may be used for the\npromotion of international peace, the advancement of the\nrule of law and the protection of human rights.\nThe world community must clearly oppose chauvinistic\nnationalism, take a clear-cut stand against policies of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" and unequivocally continue making all efforts\nuntil we achieve the complete dismantlement of the unjust\nand inhumane social systems based on ethnic political\nsegregation and the development and consolidation of a\nnon-racial, democratic South Africa.\nThe effective promotion of human rights cannot be\nseparated from the global trend towards democratization.\nCyprus is in the forefront of States that have become party\nto treaties for the protection of human rights, both at the\nglobal level, within the United Nations, and at the regional\nlevel, primarily through the Council of Europe. We are\nespecially sensitive on this subject, since one large\ncomponent of the Cyprus problem in its present dimensions\nis the massive violation of the human rights of the displaced\npersons who have been evicted by force from their homes by\nthe Turkish forces of occupation. Their homes and\nproperties have been usurped by illegal settlers imported\nfrom Turkey to Cyprus in an effort by the aggressor to\nchange the demographic composition of the population of\nCyprus.\nAll these flagrant violations of human rights have been\ncommitted by Turkey, a Member of the United Nations,\ndespite General Assembly and Security Council resolutions\ncalling on all United Nations Members to respect the\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic, avoid\nany actions which could change the demographic\ncomposition of the population of Cyprus, withdraw all\nforeign forces from the territory of the Republic and allow\nthe return of the refugees to their homes under conditions of\nsafety.\nCyprus is a case in point of the complete defiance of\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions by one\nof its members. In reality, the intransigence of the Turkish\nside, which has rendered every effort to find a solution\nimpossible, accounts for the hesitation of the Security\nCouncil to adopt measures for compliance with its\nresolutions. If a viable and lasting solution of the Cyprus\nproblem is to be arrived at without further delay and a\nfederally united State is to be established without occupation\ntroops and settlers, concerted action is required by the\ninternational community as a whole.\nIt is not only in the solution of the Cyprus problem that\nTurkey shows intransigence. The Turkish intransigence\nextends to purely humanitarian issues, such as cooperation\nin ascertaining the fate of missing persons and in\nimplementing the third Vienna agreement regarding persons\nenclaved in occupied areas.\nI wish to express appreciation for the support extended\nto Cyprus by the General Assembly, the Secretary-General\nand the Security Council. We consider a good omen of\nfurther determined action the declaration of the\nSecretary-General in his most recent report to the Security\nCouncil on Cyprus, and the Council\u2019s positive response to it,\nthat unless progress is made on the Cyprus problem he will\nrequest the Security Council to consider alternative ways of\nsecuring compliance with the many resolutions of the United\nNations on Cyprus.\nWe have had occasion in the past to express our\nsupport for the constructive suggestions of the\nSecretary-General for improving the potential of United\nNations peace-keeping operations in today\u2019s increasing\ndemand for them, including the training of personnel, the\nstrengthening of the Department of Peace-keeping\nOperations and the earmarking of appropriate equipment and\npersonnel for use by the United Nations. We are encouraged\nthat progress has been made in all these areas and in the\nsetting up of a peace-keeping Reserve Fund, but, in view of\nthe ever-increasing demands and the worsening of financial\nproblems associated with these operations, complacency is\nnot justified and we should all continue to do our best to\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nassist in discharging this major responsibility thrust on our\nOrganization.\nWith regard to peace-keeping, it has been said - not\nwithout justification - that the United Nations should avoid\nopen-ended involvement in peace-keeping operations.\nCyprus has been pointed out as an example of over-long\nUnited Nations peace-keeping involvement. The broader\nlesson to be drawn from the experience of United Nations\ninvolvement in peace-keeping and peacemaking in Cyprus is\nthat, so long as one of the parties concerned is not willing to\ncomply with the dictates of the international community as\nspelt out in unanimously adopted and binding resolutions of\nthe Security Council; and so long as the members of the\ninternational community, and more particularly the\npermanent members of the Security Council, are not willing\nor able to act effectively in order to implement resolutions\nfor which they voted, peacemaking will lag behind peace-\nkeeping, resulting in the indefinite perpetuation of the\nproblem and of the peace-keeping operation concerned. This\nis, obviously, an unsatisfactory situation - unsatisfactory to\nthe Government and the country directly concerned;\nunsatisfactory to the countries contributing to the cost of the\npeace-keeping operation; and of course, unsatisfactory to the\nUnited Nations. I submit that the answer lies not in\nabandoning the peace-keeping effort and thereby abdicating\nresponsibility, leaving the weak at the mercy of the strong\nand striking a blow against longstanding efforts to solve the\nproblem, but in pressing on with effective peacemaking\nthrough the implementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions by all available means, so as to reach a solution\nconsistent with the Charter and the United Nations\nresolutions. Cyprus is indeed a test-case, not, however, with\nregard to peace-keeping, but with regard to the effectiveness\nof the United Nations in peacemaking.\nIf I set out at some length our views on \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\", I did so not only because it is very important,\nbut also because Cyprus is itself a case-study of most of the\nproblems it raises. I shall refrain from commenting on the\nlong litany listed in this year\u2019s report of international\nproblems in which the Organization is actively engaged and\nwhich extend to all five continents. Each presents its own\ncomplications and special characteristics. They provide a\nmeasure of the enormous expectations placed upon the\nUnited Nations, the awesome burden of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s responsibilities, and the respect and admiration he\ndeserves in carrying out these responsibilities. As he rightly\npoints out:\n\\\"The United Nations, by undertaking a range of\nproblems as wide as the globe itself, must be expected\nto achieve successes but also to experience failure.\\\"\n(A/48/1, para. 512)\nWhile in the past few years the world has witnessed the\ncreation of new areas of tension and conflict through the\nunleashing of destructive and centrifugal forces of excessive\nnationalism and ethnic strife, there have also been some\nnotable successes through the solution of several regional\nissues and the withdrawal of foreign forces following the\nend of cold-war antagonism. We have witnessed in many\nparts of the world the triumph of democracy and the\nemergence of free-market economies. More concretely,\nthere has been the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the\nhistoric reunification of Germany; major progress towards\nending the odious practice of apartheid in South Africa has\nbeen achieved; and, as recently as last month, the historic\naccord between Israel and the PLO was signed at the White\nHouse, marking a new era in the Middle East. All three\nsituations had appeared to present the insurmountable\nproblems of unending and seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.\nAnd yet, with vision and imagination, the political will for\nsolutions was found.\nIn contrast, the problem with which my own country\nhas been confronted for too long has remained intractable,\ndespite the existence of unanimously adopted United Nations\nresolutions and despite the mutually acceptable procedure of\nthe good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General.\nIn our view, the problem is solvable and must be solved, yet\nthe efforts of many years have come to no result owing to\nTurkish intransigence backed by Turkish military might.\nWe remain committed to reaching a peaceful solution\non the basis of the United Nations resolutions and the high-\nlevel agreements. As clearly emerges from successive\nreports of the Secretary-General, we have cooperated with\nhim in all sincerity in the exercise of his good offices for an\noverall solution, and we have responded positively to his\nproposals for the adoption, as a first step, of the confidence-\nbuilding measures and in particular the placing of Famagusta\nand the opening of the Nicosia airport under United Nations\nadministration.\nIn 1945, the founding fathers signed the Charter in San\nFrancisco, in the aftermath of a devastating war, with the\nvision of establishing the foundations of a better and more\npeaceful world. As it nears its fiftieth anniversary, a\nwatershed in its history, the United Nations is again facing\na major challenge in a rapidly changing international climate.\nPeoples and nations all over the world place growing\nexpectations in the Organization\u2019s response to the new\nsummons for a universal alliance for peace and justice, for\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 5\ndemocracy, development and international legal order. At\nthe same time, the ominous phenomena of ethnic strife,\ndestructive nationalism, widespread poverty and social\ninjustice are undermining the vital role of the United Nations\nin opposing aggression and maintaining international peace,\nand are thus posing new challenges.\nAs the Organization is restructuring itself in order to\nmeet these challenges more effectively, it is clear that, by\nand large, the Charter has stood the test of time. As we\napproach the milestone of the fiftieth anniversary of the\nOrganization, let us agree to spare no effort to make it more\neffective, and let us look upon the Charter not merely as a\ncode of international behaviour that is difficult to live up to\nand comply with, but as a reasonable and practical model for\neveryday international behaviour and political ethics.\n"

        "file_text": "Like previous speakers, I would like to seek your\nindulgence before I start my statement as I associate my\ndelegation\u2019s voice with those who have spoken here and\nconvey our very profound condolences to the delegation of\nIndia and to the Indian people and Government for the\ndisastrous earthquake which has brought death to thousands.\nIt is a particular pleasure for me to extend to\nAmbassador Insanally my sincere congratulations on his\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am convinced that his\nwealth of experience will guarantee the success of our work.\nTo his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of the\nRepublic of Bulgaria, we wish also to express our\nappreciation for the way in which he performed his duties.\nI would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dynamism and for the\nnumerous initiatives he has taken in order to promote\ninternational peace and cooperation. Finally, my delegation\nwelcomes the presence among us of new States, whose\nadmission to membership has strengthened the universality\nof our Organization.\nAs we do every year, we have once again reached the\ntime when we assess the international situation.\nThe end of East-West confrontation, by reducing\nalready-existing tensions and by promoting the settlement of\ncertain conflicts, has engendered great hopes for peace and\ncooperation. But at the same time, it has unleashed forces\nthat need to be channelled in order to avoid new excesses\nwhich will lead to fresh tensions.\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" - very aptly reminds us of the\nexistence of other serious issues threatening international\npeace and security as well as the future of mankind, such as\npoverty, the deterioration of the environment and the debt\ncrisis. These various evils are indeed scourges which,\nbecause of the anguish and despair they generate, can\ndestabilize many societies. Nevertheless, laudable efforts are\nincreasingly being made to build a new world order based\nnot only on democracy and development but also on the\nabsolute need for respect for human rights.\nMany countries have begun to democratize their\npolitical and social systems. These changes are accompanied\n40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nby difficulties and shocks, for democracy is a difficult lesson\nto learn, requiring a lengthy apprenticeship that is made all\nthe more challenging by a fragile economic and social\ncontext. The confusion of certain mentalities which are illprepared for change must be added to this, as well. Here,\npatience, good will and even the assistance of the\ninternational community are necessary if the worst is to be\navoided.\nIn the Congo, the democratic process has been\nextremely bumpy. After the national conference which led\nto a laborious period of transition, elections were organized,\nas a result of which a Head of State, Mr. Pascal Lissouba,\nwas democratically elected by 61 per cent of the votes cast.\nOne might then have believed that the country was embarked\nupon the right course, but, alas, 25 years of totalitarian\nregimes took their toll. Dissensions within the new\nparliamentary majority are about to give rise to a motion of\ncensure, which is to say the very least premature - scarcely\nthree weeks after the formation of the first Government.\nAfter numerous vain attempts at reconciliation, the\nPresident of the Republic was moved to dissolve the\nNational Assembly to allow the sovereign people to give the\ncountry a clear-cut majority by which he could govern. This\nconstitutional prerogative was challenged by the opposition\nparties, which further exacerbated the political crisis. The\nexpress will of the President of the Republic to opt for\npeaceful means, the mediation of the high command of the\nCongolese armed forces, as well as the good offices of the\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic, Mr. Omar Bongo, made\nit possible for an agreement to be concluded on\n3 December 1992. This agreement not only enshrines the\nformation of a Government with a majority participation of\nthe opposition - more than 60 per cent - but also entrusts the\npolitical parties with organizing elections to the legislature\non an equitable basis.\nThe first round of these elections was thus organized\nlast May without any major incidents and in the presence of\nforeign observers, who did not fail to attest to the\ncorrectness of the balloting procedures. The opposition,\nwhich found itself in a minority as a result of that vote,\nsystematically challenged those results, demanding that the\nvote be invalidated by the organ in charge of organizing the\nballoting, whereas Congolese electoral law states that\nelectoral disputes are the purview of the Supreme Court,\nwhich is the only competent jurisdiction pending the creation\nof a Constitutional Council.\nBecause of certain subterfuges, clever sabotage,\ndelaying tactics and high-handed manoeuvres that ignored\nthe best interests of the nation, the Congolese opposition\ndeliberately infringed the institutional process which should\nlead to democracy and development. After the memorable\nnational conference, no one would have imagined that the\nCongolese would find themselves in the situation of refugees\nin their own country. If the people\u2019s right to civil\ndisobedience would appear to be a natural outcome of the\nConstitution of our country, civil disobedience should not be\nregarded as a synonym for destruction of the social and\neconomic fabric. Even if the conditions for such\ndisobedience had been present, the acquisition or the\nlarge-scale distribution of arms and weapons of war can\nhardly be understood, and even less their being used for the\npurposes of mass destruction and blind terrorism.\nIs it conceivable that, when the vote has not turned out\nfavourably, the streets, urban communities and innocent\npeople taken hostage become pawns which are used in\nbargaining over political decisions? Plundering the property\nof peaceful citizens - is this something which can validate\nlost causes?\nThe acts of sabotage and systematic destruction\nperpetrated by bands armed by the opposition last July\ncaused a massive loss of human life. To this we should add\nconsiderable physical and material damages. Today,\n3,000 families - in other words approximately 15,000\nCongolese - are homeless and their sole refuge are\nclassrooms and student dormitories. Such a situation poses\na serious threat to the new school year which begins in a\nfew weeks.\nOf course, the Government is making tremendous\nefforts in order to meet the vital needs of the displaced\nfamilies and to reintegrate them into Congolese society.\nBut, unfortunately, in a Republic with a ramshackle\neconomy and which is financially bereft, it is impossible for\nthis challenge to be met. That is why the Government of\nmy country appeals to the international community in order\nto obtain emergency aid to assist all those Congolese who\nhave been deprived of their property or who have been\nphysically harmed.\nDespite this tragic situation, which might indeed have\nelicited a rigid attitude from the authorities, the Republic\u2019s\nGovernment threw open the doors to negotiation. Thus,\nonce again through the mediation of President Bongo of\nGabon, an agreement - the so-called Libreville Agreement -\nwas signed in the presence of foreign observers on 4 August\nlast. This agreement, which confirmed the results of the first\nround, calls for the resumption of the second round of\nelections to the legislature initially boycotted by the\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 41\nopposition. As for the electoral dispute, it is to be decided\nby an international arbitral college which is made up as\nfollows: two judges appointed by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, two judges appointed by the European\nEconomic Community, two judges appointed by the French\nGovernment and one judge appointed by the Gabonese\nGovernment.\nThe Government thus has every hope that following\nupon this vote and the resolution of the electoral dispute, it\nwill be able to lay the definitive groundwork for a real rule\nof law with the establishment of all constitutional organs.\nThis is the situation in the Congo today. I would like\nto take this opportunity to thank all those countries and all\nthose agencies which have been kind enough to help the\nCongolese people resolve a crisis which seriously threatens\npeace in the country and which could erode national unity\nand compromise the future of the democratic process itself.\nThe Congolese Government would like to reiterate here,\nthrough me, its commitment to abide by the decision of the\narbitral college and the verdict of the ballot boxes.\nThe Congo is going through a very difficult stage. The\ndesperate state of its economy and its social fabric has led\nthe Government to undertake economic reforms. These\nreforms have so far been unfortunately frustrated by political\nand social instability. These reforms deal, inter alia, with\nrestructuring the State productive sector by the total or\npartial withdrawal of the State, the financing of economic\nrecovery, the reorganization and renegotiation of the external\ndebt and finally the defrayment of the social costs of this\nadjustment.\nIf they are to bear fruit, these efforts and the sacrifices\nthey will entail must be sustained by financial aid, otherwise\nthe Congo will remain mired in poverty and instability.\nFar from being unique, the critical economic and social\nsituation in Congo is but one illustration of a crisis that\naffects almost all African countries and many developing\ncountries. Thus, to the political factors involved we must\nadd major economic and social challenges. It is quite clear\nthat poverty threatens the cohesiveness of States and brings\nabout profound imbalances in the developing countries,\nendangering the very foundation of human rights. But there\nis one basic human right that continues to have pride of\nplace: the right to development. Despite the numerous steps\ntaken to date, the developing countries remain weighed down\nby the heavy burden of debt, and the increasing cost of\nservicing that debt is becoming unbearable for economies\nwhich are already in great trouble.\nMy delegation believes that resolving the foreign-debt\ncrisis requires bold steps. Nevertheless, we are very much\naware of all those efforts which are contributing to the\nsettlement of that crisis. That is why we greatly appreciate\nthe expression of solidarity from the French Government,\nwhich decided last year in Libreville partially to cancel the\ndebt of medium-income countries, including the Congo.\nAfter many initiatives which proved ineffective, the\ninternational community must finally give priority to growth\nand development in the poor countries by building, on the\nruins of the former East-West order, a new order based on\nmore dynamic and more innovative North-South relations\nthat would promote attainment of the objectives of the\nInternational Development Strategy enshrined in this body.\nThis Strategy should receive all the support necessary to\npromote the creation of an international trade system that is\nboth open and non-discriminatory, with the successful\noutcome of the negotiations of the Uruguay Round; to\nencourage the conclusion of specific agreements to readjust\ncommodity prices; and, finally, to find lasting solutions to\nthe external-debt crisis.\nIt is acknowledged that improving the situation in\nAfrica necessarily involves economic reform. Nevertheless,\nefforts undertaken nationally, subregionally and regionally\nhave unfortunately not enjoyed the international support\nexpected. The adoption of the New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s signified the failure of\nthe United Nations Programme of Action for African\nEconomic Recovery and Development. Unfortunately, we\ncannot but conclude that so far, this new development\nprogramme has fallen far short of expectations.\nThat being the case, my delegation welcomes the\ndecision taken by the Japanese Government to convene, in\ncooperation with the United Nations and the Global\nCoalition for Africa, on 5 and 6 October next in Tokyo an\nInternational Conference on African Development, and we\nvoice the hope that this Conference will lead to concrete\nmeasures.\nThe economic crisis which besets our countries is\nparticularly damaging to young people. Juvenile\ndelinquency, illicit drug trafficking, drug abuse and AIDS\nare all serious threats to our societies. It is essential that\nthey be given close attention. In this connection, more\nsolidarity should be displayed in order to eradicate these\nscourges.\nMy delegation supports the conclusions reached by the\nmost recent session of the Economic and Social Council on\n42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nefforts to combat malaria, dysentery and, particularly,\ncholera. The United Nations system must attach a high\npriority to Africa, taking into account the serious\nconsequences these scourges have for development\nprogrammes.\nThere can be lasting economic and social development\nonly in a healthy environment. The results reached by the\nRio Conference, enshrined in Agenda 21, are extremely\nheartening. They undoubtedly reflect a global consensus as\nwell as a political commitment at the highest level to\ncooperation for the purposes of development and the\nenvironment. But the key to their success resides in the\nfinancial resources made available.\nToday, more than ever before, the increase in natural\ndisasters is a matter of concern to us all. That is why my\ndelegation welcomes the Japanese Government\u2019s offer to\nhost, in 1994, a World Conference on Natural Disaster\nReduction, which will deal with the various dangers these\ndisasters entail and identify the necessary guidelines under\nwhich they can be taken into account by the United Nations\nin its development projects.\nSince we have boldly struck out on the path to building\na State of law, my Government supports the international\ncommunity\u2019s action to promote and develop human rights.\nThat is why we welcome the results of the World\nConference on Human Rights, held last June in Vienna, and\nreiterate our appeal to fund-raisers to help finance the\nvarious action programmes which were drawn up in that\ncontext.\nThe current session has started at a time when the\npersistence of local conflicts and the resurgence of hotbeds\nof tension are a daily concern of our Organization in its\nmission to build and preserve peace. Nevertheless, although\nwe can welcome the favourable developments in certain\nsituations, it must be recognized that a large number of them\nremain subjects of grave concern.\nAmong the former, we have the situation in South\nAfrica. A number of factors today indicate that the\nabhorrent system of apartheid will inevitably be eradicated,\neven if tensions are still rife and there are still scenes of\nviolence. The process of democratization in South Africa\ncan no longer be in question. The fact that 27 April 1994\nhas been fixed for the first multiracial elections is proof of\nthis. My delegation gives their due value to the efforts\nwhich have been constantly made by the South African\nGovernment to eradicate apartheid and to democratize the\ncountry. Furthermore, we support the request for the lifting\nof sanctions formulated by Nelson Mandela.\nMy Government believes that peace in Somalia can be\nrestored only if Security Council resolutions 751 (1992), 794\n(1992) and 814 (1993) are implemented, resolutions which,\ninter alia, call for the organization of a reconciliation\nconference and a national-unity conference.\nTurning to the question of Angola, we regret to note\nthat the refusal of UNITA to accept the result of the voting\nand the free choice of a sovereign people has once again\nplunged the country into hostilities, further complicating not\nonly the process of democratization that had been embarked\nupon but also the peace negotiations which are currently\ntaking place under the aegis of the United Nations. My\ndelegation welcomes the adoption by the Security Council of\nresolutions 851 (1993) and 864 (1993) and supports recent\ninitiatives by the King of Morocco, the President of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire and the President of the African National Congress.\nThe agreement recently reached between the\nGovernment of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front\ngives us reason to hope that an era of peace will come to\nthat country, contributing to the strengthening of the bases\nof national unity. We hope that the Rwandese people, after\nrecovering peace and unity, will be able to get down to the\ndifficult task of rebuilding their country.\nRegarding the cases of Liberia, Mozambique and\nWestern Sahara, in which my delegation fully and firmly\nsupports initiatives of the United Nations, we call upon the\nparties to the conflicts to have recourse to negotiation, to\ndialogue and to other peaceful means in order to restore\npeace and security in that area.\nThe Washington Agreement of 13 September 1993\nrepresents a decisive turning-point towards settlement of the\nPalestinian problem, and it will contribute to an\nimprovement of the situation in the Middle East. The\nsigning of this agreement promises a new era of peace and\ncooperation for the peoples of that region.\nNor can we fail to commend the very fortunate\noutcome of the situation in Cambodia, where elections,\norganized under the auspices of the United Nations, led to\nthe creation of a government of national unity.\nDespite the involvement of the United Nations, the\nsituation in the former Yugoslavia has not basically changed.\nMy country supports all the initiatives taken by the United\nNations - in particular, those that encourage dialogue and\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 43\nnegotiation - with a view to ensuring the success of the talks\nin Geneva.\nAs in the past, the process of the peaceful reunification\nof the Korean peninsula enjoys the support of my delegation\nand my Government.\nIt is very pleasing to note that considerable progress has\nbeen made in the process of disarmament and the control of\narmaments. Unfortunately, the danger of war has not yet\nbeen eliminated, as there still exist a number of arsenals of\nweapons of mass destruction - in particular, nuclear\nweapons. For this reason my Government will continue to\nappeal urgently for general and complete disarmament.\nPeace and development are complementary. Each\ndepends on the other. Thus, the promotion of confidence\nand security, which are the prerequisites for the achievement\nof development targets, is becoming a new priority in Africa.\nAware of this, the members of the Economic Community of\nCentral African States, with the assistance of the United\nNations, are now addressing themselves to progressive\nimplementation of the work programme of the Standing\nAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in Central\nAfrica, which was adopted by the General Assembly last\nyear. That Committee, which adopted a draft non-aggression\npact following its third meeting, held in Libreville, will hold\nits fourth meeting in Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo.\nThis indicates the political commitment of the States of\nCentral Africa to the creation of a system of collective\nsecurity through the promotion of confidence, security and\ndevelopment. These actions of the States of Central Africa\nmust be seen as part and parcel of the machinery for the\nprevention, management and settlement of conflicts that was\nset up at the most recent Summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nwhich was held in Cairo in June of this year. The\ninternational community - particularly the United Nations -\nshould give these initiatives the support that is necessary if\ntheir noble objectives are to be accomplished.\nIn recent years the United Nations has been working\nvery positively on a number of fronts. Its efforts have lent\nit undoubted authority, especially in the settlement of\nconflicts and in the shaping of the new order, which\nmankind hopes will be more democratic and will generate\nprosperity for all. Nevertheless, there is now a pressing\nneed to restructure the United Nations. This is especially\ntrue with regard to the question of enlargement of the\nSecurity Council and an increase in the number of its\npermanent members. Such a reform would tend to increase\nthe effectiveness of that vital body, which is responsible for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. This is\none of the fundamental aspects of the necessary process of\ndemocratizing international relations.\nThe Government of the Republic of Congo attaches\nmajor importance to strengthening the role of the United\nNations, as well as to increasing respect for the principles of\nthe Charter, which is a sine qua non for the advent of a new\norder based on justice for all, peace, prosperity and\ninternational solidarity.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to take this opportunity\nto congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. I am confident that his great experience and\nwisdom will guarantee the success of this session.\nI wish also to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-\nseventh session, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for his significant achievements and his\nconstant, unfailing commitment to the work of the\nAssembly.\nLet me pay a well-deserved tribute also to His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a man ready to face\nany challenge and an ardent champion of human rights, for\nthe masterly and enlightened way in which he is heading the\nSecretariat of the Organization. My country appreciates the\ntireless efforts of the office of the Secretary-General as it\nstrives to keep the peace throughout the world.\nI take great pleasure in welcoming the States that have\njust become Members of the United Nations, particularly\nEritrea, which by dint of courage, self-denial and sacrifice\nhas regained its dignity and its place in the great family of\nindependent States.\nThe opening of a new session of the General Assembly\ngives us an opportunity to share our thoughts on important\nworld events and to mark a line of collective conduct in\nhuman affairs. The most striking trend over the past few\nyears, one which has borne fruit, is that of the protection of\nhuman rights vis-\u00e0-vis the State. This ideology of human\nrights and minority rights has been decisive: today, evils\nthat had plagued the international community have\ndisappeared or are disappearing, for example the seemingly\nunbridgeable ideological gap between East and West, the\nsituation in South Africa, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nEntire regions see the possibility of releasing significant\nintellectual and material resources which were once devoted\nto preparing for conflict but which now can be used to\nestablish genuine, welcome peace.\nWe must hail the courage of visionary leaders who,\nfighting against the current, have dared to challenge those\nwho saw security concerns as the only political wisdom and\nto blaze new trails for their peoples and for the world.\nThe sight of the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization and the Prime Minister of Israel signing their\nhistoric agreement in Washington, D.C., and shaking hands\nwith each other has been for many of us a source of hope,\ninspiration and the will to persevere. They deserve our\npraise for having recognized each other and engaged in\ndialogue, thereby taking the first step down the long road\nthat we must now follow to arrive at a viable and lasting\npeace.\nThat courageous decision shows all those who refuse to\nspeak save through the voices of their guns that it is still\npossible to break free from the grip of hatred and denial of\neach other\u2019s existence.The process that has been set in\nmotion in the search for a comprehensive and lasting\nsettlement must of necessity be based on Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It deserves the full\npolitical and financial support of the international\ncommunity.\nIn an equally explosive context, the white minority\nregime of South Africa has embarked on a process of\npolitical reform by signing an agreement for provisional\npower sharing with the country\u2019s black majority. That\ncrucial measure will have a lasting effect on the political\nstability, economic progress and prosperity both of that\ncountry and the entire region.\nThis development represents a threat to the extremist\nand intransigent minorities, which threaten chaos and\nanarchy if their demands are not met. However, we are\nconvinced that the Government of South Africa and the\nAfrican National Congress, acting in a spirit of openness and\ncompromise, will oppose any concession or half measure\nthat might jeopardize the long march towards a multiracial\nand egalitarian society. In that connection, we support the\nappeal made by Mr. Mandela that the economic sanctions\nimposed upon his country be lifted to facilitate the transition\nto democratic rule.\nUnfortunately, South Africa is not the only battlefield\nfor extremists. We must recognize that Mozambique,\nSomalia, Bosnia and Angola, to mention but a few, are still\nthe victims of fratricidal conflicts. What we are witnessing\nis a phenomenon that was long contained and suppressed by\nthe antagonisms that existed between the two power blocs\nduring the cold-war period, when super-Power pressures\nwere so great that satellite countries were often employed as\nintermediaries in the settlement of accounts. As a result,\ninternal conflicts were promptly nipped in the bud. Today,\nthe concept of two blocs is no longer valid, and\nconflagrations are breaking out almost everywhere.\nUnfortunately, the task of dealing with these hotbeds of\nconflict has fallen to the United Nations, and, as a result, all\nnations must now participate in one way or another in the\nactivities of the Organization.\nWe are convinced that there are other ways of halting\nthe renewed outbreak of such conflicts than through a\nsystematic recourse to force. Naturally, violations of\ninternational law and human values and the ever-increasing\ncontempt for human life are of central concern to the\ninternational community. However, we must recognize that\nthe United Nations is suffering from inadequate structures,\nfrom poor organization and from a lack of financing, as well\nas from a personnel shortage that renders it impotent to deal\nwith such situations. It is therefore vitally important that the\nOrganization be provided with the financial and human\nresources it needs to remedy its shortcomings.\nMy Government believes that the United Nations should\nhave its own volunteer rapid-deployment force under\nSecurity Council control and the command of the Secretary-\nGeneral, prepared to be deployed at any time in hotbeds of\ntension, for we are constantly being made aware that the best\nmethod of dealing with conflicts is to prevent them. We\nbelieve in preventive diplomacy. Such a force should be\ntrained and armed for limited and defensive actions and\nprovided with a logistical support capable of dealing with\nany eventuality.\nHowever, we are aware of the difficulties such a force\nwould face. The principle of humanitarian intervention\nwould conflict with the notion of State sovereignty, but at\nthe present juncture the United Nations is still the only\navailable \\\"fire department,\\\" if I may use that term. It is thus\nhigh time that its finances were put in order, even if that\nentailed granting it the power to seek access to other sources\nof financing, while reinforcing integrity and austerity through\nthe establishment of a general inspection body.\nApart from those financial questions, we believe that\nthe United Nations system also needs reform. The Security\nCouncil should be expanded by the addition of a permanent\nmember for each region, thus modifying the monopoly on\nthe right of the veto. Indeed, the United Nations must be\nperceived as an international body that expresses the\nconcerns of every sovereign country and in which\ntransparency and globalization prevail.\nAll of those questions arise each time the Organization\nintervenes in a given conflict. In Somalia, in Angola, in\nMozambique, the Organization has suffered from its inability\nto mobilize the military personnel required for the scheduled\nperiod, to such an extent that its mission finds itself at a\nstandstill. In Angola a tragic situation exists owing to the\nOrganization\u2019s inability to disarm the combatants.\nFortunately, in Mozambique a spirit of compromise has\nprevailed over deadly passions. As for Somalia, the United\nStates initiative under the auspices of the Unified Task Force\nhas made it possible to avoid an unprecedented disaster.\nThe United Nations experience in Somalia is far from\nthe negative one it is casually described as being. A mission\ndesigned to ensure a safe environment and the distribution\nof humanitarian aid has achieved remarkable progress.\nHunger exists only in a few remote areas, violence is\nsporadic and limited but controlled. Training centres and\nhospitals have been opened, and there are signs that business\nis beginning to pick up. Political reconciliation meetings\nhave been held by the clan leaders in various parts of the\ncountry, and the creation of a basic political framework, the\ndistrict council, is well under way. We can confidently look\nforward to the groundroots development of the regional\ncouncil that will elect future political leaders. Somalians are\nparticipating to a greater degree in the development process\nof planning, identifying and setting priorities.\nWe believe that the police services and judicial system\nthat will soon be re-established will be capable of assuming\na large part of the responsibilities for the maintenance of\norder and security in Somalia.\nAs a result, we would reiterate our appeal to donors to\nfulfil the financial commitments they have made to the\nOrganization, because the complete success of the United\nNations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) will depend\non it. Should they fail to do so, the procrastinations and\nfailings of UNOSOM II will be a great encouragement to the\nso-called warlords, skilled as they are in clan violence, and\ndestroy any chance of the development of democracy and\nthe rule of law.\nWe would also recall that in its initial desire to bring\nabout the prompt restoration of political structures the\nOrganization agreed to work with the elements that were\navailable, which gave the Somali \\\"hawks\\\" an exaggerated\nidea of their own importance. It is vital that such detractors\nbe stripped of their ability to do harm, so that true\ndemocracy can be established. In our opinion, that is the\nonly way to avoid getting stuck in a rut of passivity, as has\noccurred in the United Nations experience in Bosnia, where\nthe worst violations of basic human rights have merely given\nrise to expressions of indignation or verbal condemnations,\napart from a few resolutions that have remained a dead letter\nwhile extortions and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" continue, in defiance\nof international law.\nIn addition, the excessive delay in setting up the War\nTribunal has only aggravated the morbid passivity of the\ninternational community. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that\nthat Tribunal will soon begin to hold sessions, with the\npersonnel, powers, funding and cooperation of Member\nStates that will be vital to its effective operation. We are\nstressing this point because we deplore the policy of double\nstandards being pursued by the United Nations, a policy that\nallows the criminals in Bosnia to operate with impunity\nwhile mercilessly pursuing others elsewhere in the world.\nThis unquestionably discredits United Nations activities and\nexposes collective security to the insatiable appetites of\naggressors and warlords of all kinds.\nWhen resolutions are adopted, the United Nations must\nensure that they are respected and complied with, or\n\\\"collective security\\\" will come to mean \\\"selective security\\\".\nUnfortunately, ethnic and community conflicts are not\nthe only threats to world peace. The poverty of the\ncountries of the third world, compounded by artificial\nborders inherited from the colonial era, constitutes another\ncatalyst for conflict, because this completely misguided\ncarve-up created territorial entities that are scarcely\neconomically viable. These countries, once buffer States for\nthe super-Powers, have become veritable arsenals, and, with\nthe added element of poverty, the regimes in power thus\ntend to opt more often for force than for reason.\nIn the face of so many constraints, building a\nprosperous and harmonious nation with a common identity\nand inspired by the values and principles of democracy has\nbeen a daunting challenge. Many developing countries\nembroiled in internal strife and turmoil have become bogged\ndown in chaos, leading to the disintegration of the State.\nHence, populations fleeing these regions invade such\ncountries as Djibouti, which is currently groaning under the\nburden of 130,000 refugees, equivalent to 23 per cent of its\npopulation.\nWe bear this immense burden nevertheless, because, in\nthe end, the only driving force of the great global village\nthat the world has become is interdependence. Thus,\nassistance to developing countries should be increased, as\nshould the provision of skills and technology through\nmultilateral cooperation. Furthermore, we believe that\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 43\nregional economic integration is the basis for continuing\nprogress and lasting prosperity.\nWith the emergence of important regional economic\nblocs, our countries are threatened with marginalization. In\nthe context of economic stagnation, the great hope born of\nthe end of the cold war has gone up in smoke. We are still\nawaiting the extra resources that might have been allocated\nto development. Worse still, the commitment of developed\ncountries to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national\nproduct - a modest goal set by the United Nations for\ndevelopment aid - has been met by only two countries. The\nothers have barely managed to achieve 0.2 per cent at the\nmost.\nDespite a difficult and sometimes chaotic situation, a\nnumber of developing countries have made substantial\nprogress and present the necessary conditions to benefit from\nsignificant and ongoing assistance, while others are regarded\nas insolvent by international lending institutions.\nIt is obvious that we desperately need increased\nmultilateral and bilateral aid to enable us to meet our\nbudgetary and investment needs because our private sources\nof investment have dwindled. To this gloomy picture we\nmust add the misappropriation of aid or mismanagement of\nit. Nevertheless, many countries have committed\nthemselves to economic reform and structural readjustment,\nwhich require increased aid, especially from the international\nfinancial institutions.\nMy country, responding to the rapid developments\ntaking place in international trade and navigation - the bases\nof our economy - has revamped its port facilities, financial\nservices and communication networks.\nAnxious not to sail against what has been called the\nwind of democracy, we have undertaken political reforms,\nelections have been held and a new Constitution has been\nadopted defining and guaranteeing individual rights.\nDespite a very hostile and very unstable regional\nenvironment, Djibouti has always been an island of stability\nand a safe haven. The ill effects of the deep turmoil in our\nregion have considerably weakened the Republic of Djibouti,\nand the deployment of enormous quantities of armaments in\nthe region has not helped to maintain a peaceful climate and\nenvironment.\nThus, the Republic of Djibouti will come to have its\nown share of political troubles, a natural extension of\nregional instability. But these troubles will be contained,\nbecause Djibouti will strengthen its nation by discouraging\nviolence.\nSuch are the road taken and the commitment made by\nthe Republic of Djibouti to preserve and strengthen peace at\nhome and throughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your election to your important post. I see\nit as a manifestation of respect for the peace-loving policy\nof Guyana, and as a tribute to the growing role of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean countries in international affairs.\nLast year demonstrated the great potential for drama\ninherent in the post-confrontational and post-communist\nworld. We have seen that the very highest levels of\ncooperation are achievable. We see truly exciting prospects\nin yesterday\u2019s address by President Bill Clinton of the\nUnited States and in other statements already delivered from\nthis rostrum.\nAt the same time, developments in the former\nYugoslavia, Abkhazia and Karabakh have also revealed the\ntrue depths of barbarism and the significant new threat of\naggressive nationalism.\nOutbursts of violence caused by xenophobia, even in\ntraditionally prosperous countries, have shown that no one is\nsafe from this danger. It is no less serious a threat to peace\ntoday than nuclear war was yesterday. The world\ncommunity mustered the strength to stave off the nuclear\ndanger. An important guarantee against this was the\nRussian-American START II Treaty. Nowadays we all\nconfront the equally formidable challenge of a new\ngeneration of conflicts and wars triggered by nationalist,\npolitical and religious intolerance. That is why democracy\nand peacemaking must be the key terms defining the strategy\nof the world community as it moves into the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThe United Nations is now turning to face this new\nchallenge. The successful United Nations operation in\nCambodia was one of the largest in the history of the\nOrganization. Life is returning to normal in a country so\nlong torn by civil war. We stand ready, together with other\nmembers of the international community, to help the people\nof Cambodia to rebuild their country.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 15\nWe have seen a political and psychological\nbreakthrough in the solution of the key problem of the\nMiddle East settlement, which is the problem of Palestine.\nWe pay tribute to the courageous leaders of Israel and the\nPLO who have taken the first and most difficult step towards\nmutual recognition and reconciliation. We are ready to\nparticipate in an international conference on the economic\ndevelopment of self-governing Palestinian territories.\nRussia, as a co-sponsor of the Conference on the Middle\nEast, will spare no effort to advance the peace process in all\nother areas.\nHowever, the key to the settlement of many conflicts\nhas not yet been found. Russia will continue to encourage\nthe parties to the Bosnian conflict not to lose the chance of\na peaceful settlement and will contribute to the operation for\nits implementation under United Nations command.\nTwice during wartime I have had occasion to visit\nSarajevo. I propose that the United Nations should place the\ncity under its moral and political protection and that it\nshould be declared a centre of coexistence and a meeting\npoint for Islam, the Orthodox Church, Catholicism and other\nreligions. The city should become a symbol for the whole\nworld, a reminder that political violence and intolerance\nunder the banner of religion are the worst possible crimes\nagainst religion itself and the human spirit. In any case, it\nis surely time to think of establishing closer contacts\nbetween the United Nations and the world\u2019s leading\nreligions.\nThe international community seems to have turned a\nblind eye to Afghanistan and Angola as soon as they ceased\nto be pawns in the cold war. The United Nations has no\nright to leave millions of people who live there in the grip\nof an epidemic of ethnic, clan and religious extremism and\nto forget their economic and humanitarian problems,\nincluding that of the liberation of former Soviet prisoners of\nwar.\nWe must learn the lessons of the United Nations\noperation in Somalia and considerably improve its\neffectiveness. Conscious of its special responsibility for\nmaintaining peace, Russia has made peacemaking and the\nprotection of human rights, particularly those of national\nminorities, the priority of its foreign policy, first and\nforemost in the territory of the former USSR.\nWe will spare no effort to strengthen the\nCommonwealth of Independent States and make it a positive\nfactor, not only regionally, but globally. I call upon\nMembers of the United Nations to support proposals\nsubmitted jointly by the members of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States to the present session, relating in\nparticular to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, the struggle against international terrorism and\nthe protection of the environment.\nOur peacemaking efforts are already yielding their first\nresults. For more than a year now there have been no\nhostilities in the Transdniester region and South Ossetia.\nWith our participation, the process of normalization of the\nsituation and national dialogue has started in Tajikistan.\nRussia is making active efforts to put an end to the\nAbkhazian and Karabakh conflicts and to render\nhumanitarian assistance to their victims.\nAll these problems are too serious and too tragic for\nspeculation about neo-imperial plans of Russia, diplomatic\nrivalry, or the search for new spheres of influence by\nneighbouring and distant Powers. The United Nations, the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),\nand all States truly interested in peace, along with Russia,\nwill have enough work to do together. We want to see\nmuch more active assistance for our peacemaking efforts,\nnot in words, but in deeds.\nIn most cases this means that the United Nations should\ngive a mandate for operations conducted at the request of\nconflicting parties on the basis of appropriate agreements.\nFor this, close interaction with the United Nations and the\nCSCE missions is essential. Also, our minds should be open\nto non-traditional methods, such as the participation of\ncontingents of the conflicting parties themselves and those\nof a neighbouring mediating State. The pragmatic nature of\nsuch a model was shown in particular in the Transdniester\nregion and in South Ossetia. This model should be used,\nand not disregarded, in other regions, in the interests of the\nUnited Nations, which is facing an overload of peace-\nkeeping operations. The collective peacemaking forces of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States could also interact\nwith the United Nations itself. It is in any case time to\nestablish closer relations between the two organizations.\nIn material and financial terms the burden of\npeacemaking borne by Russia alone today in the territory of\nthe former USSR must be lightened. This could mean\nestablishing a voluntary fund for this purpose. Of course,\nRussia realizes that no international organization or group of\nStates can replace our peacemaking efforts in this specific\npost-Soviet area.\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nBy and large, taking into consideration the wide\nexperience gained throughout the world, it is time to think\nof a modern overall strategy of peacemaking which would\nbe integrated with \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" proposed by the\nSecretary-General.\nThe Russian Federation, as an initiator of the statement\nof the President of the Security Council on peacemaking and\npeace-keeping issues, made on 28 May 1993, makes the\nfollowing proposals.\nThe first is to define a clear-cut concept of political\nleadership by the Security Council, create an effective\nmilitary command under the supervision of the Secretary-\nGeneral and establish a procedure for involving, on that\nbasis, regional organizations.\nThe second is to establish under Article 29 of the\nUnited Nations Charter a special Security Council committee\non improving peace-keeping operation practices. This could\ninclude those States which have already gained considerable\nexperience in this area of United Nations activity.\nOur third proposal is to set up United Nations stand-by\nforces which would be at the disposal of Member States and\nused in peacemaking operations with the consent of their\nGovernments on a case-by-case basis at the request of the\nSecretary-General.\nAll these questions directly relate to the process of\nrenewal of the United Nations. The reform of United\nNations bodies, including the Security Council, will make\nsense and be effective if it allows for a more adequate\nresponse to new challenges in the field of peacemaking.\nThe settlement of conflicts should go hand in hand with\nthe international protection of their victims. As a follow-up\nto the Geneva International Conference on the Protection of\nVictims of War, we propose that international legal\nrestrictions be imposed on the use in internal conflicts of the\nmost destructive and indiscriminate types of weapons,\nprimarily military aircraft and artillery-rocket systems. We\nshould also eliminate or call a halt to the use of mercenaries\nand volunteers both in domestic and international conflicts.\nWe propose the establishment of a permanent\ninternational tribunal to deal with crimes against humanity.\nThe inevitability of punishment will help to prevent the\nrecurrence of such atrocities.\nIt has become crucially important to address\ncomprehensively the problem of refugees and to specify the\nrelevant principles of international law at a special\nconference.\nPeacemaking cannot be separated from the protection\nof human rights. The international community is duty-bound\nto condemn strongly \\\"double\\\" or lower standards of human\nrights protection, the theory and practice of the superiority\nof rights of an \\\"indigenous\\\" nation and the creation of mono-\nethnic States. The time has come to establish a United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Following\nthe example of the Conference on Security and Cooperation\nin Europe, it is time for the United Nations also to have a\nSpecial Rapporteur on National Minorities. We support the\nproposals of the Secretary-General in the field of human\nrights protection.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction would\ndirectly contradict the peacemaking efforts of the United\nNations. This poses an ever growing threat not only in the\nfuture but even at the present. We are ready to cooperate\nwith the United States and other countries in solving the\nproblems connected with cutting off fissionable material\nproduction and banning the construction of facilities for such\nproduction, particularly in conflict areas.\nWe are in favour of transforming the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty into a universal agreement of\nunlimited duration. The United Nations should also work to\nensure the universality of and strict compliance with the\nConvention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\nRussia reiterates, from this rostrum of the General\nAssembly, its intention to adhere to the international regime\nof non-proliferation of missile technology. In the very near\nfuture, we intend to take concrete steps to strengthen our\nrelevant domestic legislation, going so far as to envisage\ncriminal prosecution for violations of the rules governing the\nexport of missile equipment and technology. We call on all\nStates that possess such technology to join the Missile\nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR). It is also necessary\nto provide for equality of rights and obligations of the\nparticipants, so as to enable them freely to export peaceful\nspace technology.\nSuccessful economic reform is one of the guarantees of\npeace. This is of particular relevance to the many developing\ncountries and to the post-communist States. Easier access to\nworld markets for countries with transitional economies,\nincluding Russia, and the lifting of all discriminatory\nrestrictions is becoming an issue of the highest priority. We\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 17\nbelieve that the General Assembly should express its support\nfor efforts in this direction. We also propose the\nestablishment of a mechanism to coordinate programmes\ncarried out by the institutions of the United Nations system\nin support of economic reforms in countries in transition.\nThe strengthening of democracy is the principal\nguarantee of security and socio-economic development in the\nworld today. This has been true in Europe, Asia, Africa and\nLatin America, although the process is not proceeding easily\nand automatically everywhere. Peoples who have risen up\nagainst totalitarianism are threatened by the risk of political\nviolence and ultra-nationalism.\nWe categorically reject such an alternative. Russia is\npeacefully transforming itself in accordance with the\nfundamental principle of democracy: free elections. In 1991,\nthe people of Russia elected their country\u2019s first democratic\nPresident, and they confirmed their confidence in his policies\nat the April referendum this year. On the basis of this\ntwofold mandate, the President has taken decisive measures\nto ensure democratic elections to the Parliament in\nDecember of this year. Thus, the old totalitarian system of\npower will be definitively dismantled and replaced by a new\nsystem of power elected by the people and responsible only\nto the people. We invite international observers to monitor\nthe elections to the Parliament.\nIn building a new democratic Russia, we of course must\nfirst of all rely on our own potential. Yet we very much\nappreciate the solidarity the democratic community has\nshown us. Such solidarity is neither an act of interference\nin our domestic affairs nor the whimsical gesture of\nromanticists in international politics. It is simply an\nexpression of the human duty to protect the rights of\nindividuals in other countries.\nNext month will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the\nMoscow Conference when, in the turbulent year of 1943, the\nfoundation was laid for the establishment of the United\nNations, which was conceived as an organization of\ndemocratic countries having triumphed over Nazi\ntotalitarianism. Half a century later, the success of\ndemocracy in Russia and many other countries has made it\npossible for the first time to realize fully the lofty destiny of\nthe United Nations and to help it become a truly efficient\npeacemaking Organization.\nWe should not allow political short-sightedness, current\neconomic difficulties, egoism and conceit to make us lose\nthe chance to transform the still fragile post-communist\nworld into a democratic one. I hope that this session will\nmove us closer to an understanding of this goal and of the\nways of reaching it in the interests of all States and nations.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Syrian Arab Republic to congratulate\nAmbassador Insanally on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. I take this\nopportunity also to commend the role of his friendly country\nin the Non-Aligned Movement and the positive contribution\nto the United Nations made by the friendly countries of\nLatin America.\nI should also like on this occasion to voice our esteem\nto the President of the Assembly at its forty-seventh session,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the success he achieved during that\nsession. We extend to him and to the friendly country of\nBulgaria all best wishes for progress and prosperity.\nI wish also to welcome the new Member States that\nhave joined our international Organization. It is our hope\nthat they will make a contribution to the work of the United\nNations with their active input.\nThe end of the cold war has faced the international\ncommunity with immense challenges and substantive\nquestions most of which have remained without satisfactory\nanswers while others have been left to the judgement of\nhistory and to the vagaries of time. It has become clear to\nmany people in various parts of the world that facing up to\nthese new challenges has not been an easy task for any\nindividual country, regardless of its power or wisdom.\nThe international climate has been rendered yet more\ncomplex and difficult by the reactions of those who have\nconsidered themselves to be the victors of the cold war.\nTheir reactions have reflected their narrow short-term\ninterests rather than the elements of the new reality which\nwould have served better both their long-term interests and\nthose of other countries - or which, in the very least, would\nnot have done harm to those interests.\nThis is one of the basic reasons which, to date, have\nprevented the emergence of a new world order. It was not\nreasonable to expect the countries and peoples of the world\nto support a system in which they have no say and from\nwhich they have no tangible expectations. This might\nexplain why from one day to the next and year after year\nthere has been less talk and lower expectations of the\nemergence of a new world order on the ruins of the old\norder.\nOn today\u2019s international scene we see little construction\nand few new breakthroughs; we see many ruins, much chaos\nand numerous unanswered questions. Has the world of\ntoday become more secure and stable? Have the causes of\nsocial tension and the many forms of regional conflict\nreceded? Has the number of refugees and displaced persons\ndecreased? And has the life of ordinary people in the South,\nand even in the North, grown more prosperous or\ncomfortable?\nThese are legitimate questions, but detailing the answers\nbefore this Assembly will not be a source of joy or comfort\nto many of us, especially in view of conflagrations in\nvarious parts of the world which warn of increased human\nsuffering, ranging from killing and deportation to \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\", and real hunger. Of such things, world public\nopinion knows but very little. Suffice it to say that the\nnumber of conflicts which figure on the agenda of the\nUnited Nations is far smaller than those which are queuing\nup in the wings.\nWhen we say this, however, we do not wish to give the\nimpression, by such a graphic objective description of the\nnew international situation, that the past was better than the\npresent. Far from it. For such is not the logic of my\ncountry, Syria. Nor is it the logic of life, itself which, we\nbelieve, tends to move towards the better, inevitably and as\na matter of necessity, even if it sometimes stumbles here and\nthere or appears to be static at certain times.\nOur real aim in describing the post-cold-war\ninternational situation is to attempt a serious assessment that,\nwe truly believe, we share with many other countries which\naspire to correct the course of international relations in both\nthe political and the economic spheres, in order to make\nthem more democratic and equitable.\nIn this context, we find no better framework than the\nUnited Nations to promote international dialogue and\ncooperation. In order for such dialogue to have positive and\nfruitful results in the interest of all concerned, it is necessary\nto introduce democratic reforms that would restructure the\ndecision-making process in the Organization so that it may\nreflect the views of the majority. It is not reasonable, for\ninstance, to allow the United Nations machinery to be\nmanipulated, sometimes, in order to intervene in the internal\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\naffairs of countries under one pretext or another, before the\nMember States themselves are given the chance to introduce\nthe necessary reforms that would restructure the United\nNations in such a way as to guarantee equitable\nrepresentation in its main organs and prevent the use of\nselectivity and double standards in addressing the issues that\nare of vital importance to Member States.\nBut how can the majority of Member States expect that\nsuch needed reforms of the structure of the United Nations\nwould be introduced at a time when some countries that\npride in ending the cold war resort to launching covert and\novert cold wars against countries which would preserve their\nindependence and stand up for their national sovereignty?\nWe feel it is our duty to draw attention to the fact that\nfailure to introduce the required reforms will render the\nUnited Nations incapable of addressing the regional conflicts\nthat multiply daily. It is to be feared is that the important\nrole of this international Organization might change in the\ncourse of time to one of dealing with the problems of tens\nof thousands of United Nations soldiers entrusted with the\nmission of preserving a lost peace. This would drain the\nOrganization\u2019s resources and distract it from the many tasks\nwith which it is entrusted.\nThe multifarious feelings of concern prevailing among\nmost peoples in the world, particularly in developing\ncountries, are deeper than might at first be apparent. We, as\nArabs and Muslims, might well have become more sensitive\nthan others recently regarding what seems to be designed to\nundermine our interests and distort our history, which,\nduring its most glorious phase, was never racial or\naggressive towards other peoples and religions. Rather, it\nwas humane and civilized, as all objective Western historians\nattest.\nWe have the right to wonder about the reasons behind\nthe ongoing unjust campaign against the Arabs and Muslims,\nwho are slandered merely because some individuals have\nallegedly committed a terrorist act against Western targets,\nwhile not a word is uttered against those who are truly\nresponsible for terroristic acts against thousands of Arab\nvictims both in the occupied territories and southern\nLebanon. The time has indeed come for an awakening of\nthe Western conscience and for addressing objectively the\nsensitive issues which affect the dignity of peoples and the\nsovereignty of States. The objectivity of the strong cannot\npossibly be interpreted or understood, by any ethical\nstandard, as a concession offered to the other party. Rather\nit often promotes the strong\u2019s status and prestige.\nIt is well known to everyone in the world that the\nArab-Israeli conflict is one of the oldest, most complex and\nmost dangerous conflicts in the world. That is why the\nUnited Nations has been seized of it since it first started. It\nis also no secret to anyone who follows developments in the\nregion that Syria, under the leadership of President Hafez al\nAssad, maintained for 20 years its deeply rooted belief in the\nnecessity of establishing a just and comprehensive peace in\nthe region on the basis of United Nations resolutions and\ninternational legality.\nAlthough many peace initiatives were put forward\nduring the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to address the\nArab-Israeli conflict, Syria objected to those initiatives only\nbecause the solutions they proposed lacked\ncomprehensiveness and because they ignored participation by\nthe Palestinians and lacked the guarantees that would\nsafeguard their national rights. Once it received American\nguarantees for the participation of the Palestinians and a\ncomprehensive solution on all fronts in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978) and the land-for-peace formula, Syria has played a\npositive and fundamental role in the long and arduous\nnegotiations with the United States over the convening of a\npeace Conference in Madrid.\nBy responding positively to the American initiative,\nSyria, as the whole world has acknowledged, made the\nconvening of a peace Conference possible. In so doing,\nSyria acted on the basic of its deep conviction that, or order\nfor peace to be acceptable to our peoples, it has to be a just,\ncomprehensive peace that would result in returning return all\nthe Arab occupied territories and ensuring stability and\nsecurity for the whole region. Without such elements, peace\ncan neither survive nor become a true and stable peace in\nwhich and with which the people of the region can coexist.\nFor any peace to receive broad and continued popular\nsupport, it must be honourable for us as well as for the\nothers. The sons and mothers of our martyrs must feel that\ntheir dear ones who fell in the battlefields also contributed\nto establishing this peace on the basis of right and justice,\nand that with their sacrifices and blood they saved the nation\nfrom being forced to capitulate.\nSyria, which consistently believed in a just and\ncomprehensive peace and demonstrated its earnestness and\ndetermination to reach such peace through the Washington\ntalks and the constant coordination with the Arab parties and\nco-sponsors, is, in fact, more serious and keen in its efforts\nto achieve peace than those who deviated from the path of\nArab coordination and through their unilateral signing\nopened the doors of the region to all kinds of options.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 19\nUnless serious and urgent efforts are made to achieve\nsubstantive and tangible progress on the Syrian and\nLebanese tracks, peace might be the weakest of those\noptions.\nWe in Syria do not exaggerate the value of this\nPalestinian-Israeli agreement because each and every one of\nits provisions needs new negotiations. At the same time, we\ndo not underestimate its probable repercussions, especially\non the Palestinian arena, where it has created sharp\ndivisions. Regardless of all this, however, we think that the\nmost serious threat the peace process faces lies in Israel\u2019s\nattempts to give the impression that the signing of this\nagreement has achieved peace in the region, and that the\ninternational community, and particularly Arab countries,\nmust behave accordingly.\nThe judgement of history on the Palestinian-Israeli\nagreement since the secret Oslo talks has become the\nresponsibility of the Palestinian people and their institutions.\nNo one should think that Syria is going to obstruct this\nagreement, nor does Syria need to do so. But at the same\ntime, no one should expect that Syria is going to prevent the\nPalestinians from criticizing the agreement, while the Israeli\nPrime Minister has not been able to prevent Israeli\nopposition from doing so despite his repeated assurances that\nhe has made no concession to the Palestinians.\nYet in spite of all this, Israel still claims that it needs\nenough time to digest the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in a\nblatant attempt to evade the serious follow-up of the peace\nprocess launched in Madrid two years ago. In the meantime,\nthe international community, the United States at the fore,\nhas seen the necessity of capitalizing on the momentum\ngenerated by this agreement to continue the peace process on\nother tracks, particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.\nThe Arab States have also stressed, in the communiqu\u00e9\nissued at the meeting of their Foreign Ministers in Cairo on\n20 September 1993, that this first step:\n\\\"must be completed by urgent steps on all tracks and\nmust guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the\noccupied Syrian Golan and from the Lebanese lands ...\nfor the Arab League Council believes that, for peace in\nthe Middle East to be lasting, it has to be just and\ncomprehensive and must be based on Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and\non international legality.\\\"\nPeace cannot be built on lands under occupation, nor\ncan it be achieved through the usurpation of the rights of\nothers. Those who are trying to make people believe that\nthe Middle East has suddenly been transformed into an oasis\nof peace and prosperity know better than anyone that peace,\nstability and prosperity cannot possibly coexist with\noccupation, arrogance and the denial of the rights of others.\nIt is about time Israel stopped misleading world opinion\nand portraying itself as a victim. Is it reasonable that a\ncountry should continue to claim that it is the victim while\nit continues to produce and stockpile the most sophisticated\nof weapons, including all kinds of weapons of\nmass-destruction, and continues to occupy the lands of others\nby force, in defiance of United Nations resolutions?\nMy country, Syria, which declares its positions candidly\nand clearly to the whole world without fear of blame, will\nnot give up an inch of its occupied territories. It is\ncommitted to continuing the peace process in earnest and is\nalso committed to doing all that is required of it in\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (167) and\n338 (1973), as well as the \\\"land for peace\\\" formula. Syria\nwill also continue to work with the co-sponsors of the peace\nprocess with a view to achieving a genuine, just and\ncomprehensive peace so that the Middle East may indeed\nbecome an oasis of peace, stability and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, allow me first of all to express, on\nbehalf of the delegation, Government and people of\nEquatorial Guinea, our most sincere congratulations on your\nwell-deserved election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. Your undeniable\npersonal prestige and your recognized adherence to the\nideals that inspire our Organization will ensure the success\nof our work. Your country, Guyana, is a faithful contributor\nto and participant in the United Nations, and offers us today\nyour great experience and diplomatic skill; these ensure the\nsuccess of any decisions that may be taken at this session.\nThrough you, we should like to extend our congratulations\nto the other members of the Bureau in the conviction that\ntheir collaboration will be decisive.\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\noutgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, and his\nBureau for the contributions and guidance they provided to\nthe United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh\nsession.\nI should also like to convey to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the profound appreciation and\ngratitude of His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and\nthe Government and the people of Equatorial Guinea for his\ndedication and the efforts he has exerted in discharging the\ngreat responsibilities with which he has been entrusted in a\nmanner that is a source of pride not only for Egypt but for\nall Africa. In carrying out his mission to promote the\npeaceful emergence of a new world order and the\nmaintenance of peace, I assure the Secretary-General that he\nwill be able to continue to rely on our full cooperation and\nsupport.\nTo the new States that have joined our Organization we\nextend a very warm welcome. Their presence here\nstrengthens the United Nations vocation towards universality,\nand should contribute to the efforts of the international\ncommunity to maintain peace and promote progress and\njustice for all nations.\nMy presence in this world forum should be interpreted\nas a clear demonstration of the importance that we attach to\nthe United Nations, its principles and its noble task of\nconstantly strengthening the safeguards over the maintenance\nof peace and social and economic progress for all peoples.\nThis task is of singular importance to Equatorial Guinea,\nwhich is engaged in overcoming underdevelopment and\nachieving dignified standards of living for its people.\nThe common denominator of the many statements that\nhave been made has been the vast changes that have taken\nplace in the world since the mid-1980s, a trend towards\ntransformation the pace of which, far from decreasing, has\naccelerated considerably.\nWith the disappearance of the East-West bipolar\nstructure, which has been replaced by dialogue and\ncooperation, we find ourselves - and this is no exaggeration -\nfaced with a new configuration in international relations\n\ncharacterized by a certain degree of progress in\ndisarmament, at the global and regional levels, and an easing\nof some regional conflicts.\nEquatorial Guinea firmly supports the intensification of\nthe work of the United Nations through preventive\ndiplomacy. Measures such as the sending of missions of\ninquiry, the use of early-warning systems and the\nstrengthening of the role of regional and subregional\norganizations can be effective in avoiding conflicts which,\nonce they break out, could require subsequent, much more\ncostly intervention for peace to be restored.\nPeace-keeping operations have also undergone\nqualitative change and now cover increasingly varied\nactivities transcending the traditional sphere. In this respect\nI should like to underscore the efforts of the United Nations\nin many parts of the world in the humanitarian field, in\nproviding aid to refugees and in monitoring elections.\nProgress and efforts at the subregional level are\ncommendable. Hence we support General Assembly\nresolution 46/37 B, establishing the Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa, which\nis working for peace and confidence-building among the\nStates of our subregion. As a popular saying goes: \\\"An\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\\\" With that\nCommittee we are trying to prevent the emergence of\nconflicts in the subregion by developing measures to\nalleviate situations of conflict.\nNone the less, despite these positive steps and\nendeavours, at the global level we look to the future with a\ncertain degree of concern because we still see certain\npositions that prevent equitable economic relations and\nimpede developing countries from exercising international\nfree trade. The sound of the machine-gun and the cannon is\nstill dashing the hopes of many innocent peoples to live in\npeace and tranquillity. The present international situation,\nwe might say, fluctuates between uneasiness and hope. We\nhope that the global changes and the end of the cold war\nwill bring renewed life to countries of the third world.\nThe industrialized countries must understand the need\nto resolve, on mutually agreed terms, the external debt\nproblem of underdeveloped countries. The weight of that\ndebt is another serious difficulty standing in the way of their\nachieving a better standard of living.\nMy country hopes that the new world scene will be\nconducive to the implementation of procedures for sincere\ninternational cooperation for those nations that most need\nsuch cooperation, countries that are now struggling not just\nfor a standard of living but for their very survival. Poverty,\nthe sad fate of many States in our world, requires that united\naction be taken by the other States in order to remedy the\nsituation. The gap between rich and poor is widening at an\nalarming pace; that disparity can not leave the international\ncommunity indifferent. Hence it is necessary to strengthen\nthe Economic and Social Council and the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in order\nto meet the new realities.\nThe problem of preserving the environment and the\nstruggle against illicit drug-trafficking are questions that\nrequire our reflection. With the 1992 Stockholm Declaration\nwe laid the foundations of certain universal principles to\npreserve the global environment and made efforts to stem\npollution, desertification and deforestation. But the situation\nrequired new initiatives, and these culminated in the\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\nde Janeiro.\nWe hope that these results will have positive effects\noverall and that it will be possible to ensure sustainable\ndevelopment and the future well-being of mankind.\nNone the less, I wish to emphasize the obligation of the\ndeveloped countries, which bear the greatest responsibility\nfor the deterioration of the global ecosystem, towards those\nother countries that are today being asked to make enormous\nsacrifices by limiting their legitimate right to use the assets\ngiven them by nature. There is a need to seek the necessary\ncompensation for this situation, in particular by the financing\nof alternative projects and through technological cooperation.\nWithin its modest economic means my Government has\nalways been, and remains, prepared to take action in order\nto improve its national environment as a contribution to the\ntask of preserving the global environment.\nWe condemn the illicit traffic in drugs and are prepared\nto support any international initiative aimed at its\nsuppression.\nThe Government of Equatorial Guinea is unflagging in\nits struggle against the acquired immune deficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS) pandemic, and it will spare no effort for\nits effective control, thanks to the deep awareness of our\npeople and the assistance we receive in this connection from\ninternational organizations.\nTo reflect the noble ideals of peace and justice of the\npeople of Equatorial Guinea, my Government has embarked\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3\non a progressive democratic process that guarantees to every\ncitizen of the country the exercise of fundamental rights and\nfreedoms.\nThe firm democratic process begun in the country has\nbeen well-received by the people of Equatorial Guinea and\nby those countries that set aside mere rhetoric and concealed\npolitical interests, love Equatorial Guinea and hope that it\nwill progress. The aspiration of the people and the\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea is that our process will be\ncarried through in a climate of national concord without\nupheaval, without disturbances that could threaten the peace\nand stability prevailing in the country.\nThat is why, following the massive adoption of the new\nfundamental law which enshrined our multiparty system, in\nthe context of Law No. 3 1992 on political parties, the\nfollowing political organizations have been made legal.\nFirst, the Popular Union submitted its application on\n24 April 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.\nSecond, the Liberal Democratic Convention submitted\nits application on 1 April 1992 and was recognized on 17\nOctober 1992.\nThird, the Social Democrat Party submitted its\napplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17\nOctober 1992.\nFourth, the Progressive Democratic Alliance submitted\nits application on 9 July 1992 and was recognized on 4\nSeptember 1992.\nFifth, the Social Democratic Union submitted its\napplication on 8 June 1992 and was recognized on 17\nOctober 1992.\nSixth, the Progress Party submitted its application on\n18 May 1992 and was recognized on 17 October 1992.\nSeventh, the Social Democratic and Popular\nConvergence submitted its application on 18 May 1992 and\nwas recognized on 5 February 1993.\nEighth, the Social Democratic Coalition Party of\nEquatorial Guinea submitted its application on 4 November\n1992 and was recognized on 5 February 1993.\nNinth, Convergence for Social Democracy submitted its\napplication on 7 November 1992 and was recognized on\n5 February 1993.\nTenth, the Equatorial Guinea Popular Action submitted\nits application on 28 December 1992 and was recognized on\n5 February 1993.\nEleventh, the National Democratic Union submitted its\napplication on 29 March 1993 and was recognized on 10\nMay 1993.\nTwelfth, the Socialist Party of Equatorial Guinea\nsubmitted its application on 23 March 1993 and was\nrecognized on 10 May 1993.\nThirteenth, the Liberal Party submitted its application\non 23 March 1993 and was recognized on 12 July 1993.\nIn addition to other provisions, such as the law\nguaranteeing freedom of association and freedom to\ndemonstrate, and the law on the right to protest and to\npetition, the determination of the Government to establish\ndemocracy peacefully in the country has taken concrete\nshape in the signing of a document - called the National\nPact - between the Government and the opposition, which\nreflects the combined aspirations of all the political forces\nand is a channel for ensuring the success of the\ndemocratization process.\nOut of our constant desire to give greater political\ntransparency to the process, we have postponed until 21\nNovember 1993 the legislative elections originally planned\nfor 12 September 1993. We have done so in order to take\ninto account and meet the wishes of certain political groups.\nThe political spectrum for the forthcoming general\nlegislative elections now looks like this: there are political\nparties that have decided to participate in the legislative\nelections, political parties that intend to participate in the\nlegislative elections, and political parties that have not yet\ndecided whether to participate in the legislative elections.\nThe political parties that have decided to participate in\nthe legislative elections are: the Democratic Party of\nEquatorial Guinea, the Liberal Democratic Convention, the\nSocial Democratic Union, the Liberal Party and the Social\nDemocratic Party. This very morning, my Government\ninformed me that the Party of the Convergence for Social\nand People\u2019s Democracy has also decided to participate in\nthe legislative elections.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe political parties that have expressed their intention\nto participate in the legislative elections are: the Progress\nParty, Tom\u00e1s Boi Cheky Division; and the Social Democrat\nCoalition Party, Massoko Division.\nWith regard to the political parties that have not\ndecided whether to participate in the legislative elections, the\nGovernment of Equatorial Guinea has received no official\nnotification of a decision to participate in the legislative\nelections of 21 November from the following political\nparties: the Progress Party, Severo Moto Division; the\nSocial Democratic Convergence; the Progressive Democratic\nAlliance; the Social Democrat Coalition Party, Buenaventura\nMonsuy Division; People\u2019s Action of Equatorial Guinea; the\nNational Democratic Union; and the Socialist Party of\nEquatorial Guinea.\nIn connection with the revision of the electoral law\nproposed by the opposition political parties, on 19 October\nand 13 and 18 November the Government extended an\ninvitation to these parties to participate in some meetings,\nbut they did not come to the meetings or give any reason for\nnot doing so.\nIn view of the opposition parties\u2019 inexplicable refusal\nto participate, and in order to avoid any stagnation in the\npolitical democratization process, the Government used its\nlegislative initiative, under our Basic Law, to adopt a draft\nlaw, which was sent to the House of Representatives and\napproved with amendments by that legislative body. The\ntext of the law was approved and promulgated by our Head\nof State in January 1993.\nIt should be pointed out that the electoral law now in\nforce is based on comparative law - mainly the electoral\nlegislation of Spain, France and Gabon. For that reason, the\nGovernment is firmly convinced that the rejection of the\nelectoral law by the opposition political parties that have not\nexpressed their intention to participate in the legislative\nelections of 21 November 1993 is nothing but a pretext for\ndelaying or blocking the process that has been set in motion.\nThere is no doubt that the implementation of the democratic\nprocess in Equatorial Guinea has been made possible by the\nselflessness and determination of His Excellency Obiang\nNguema Mbasogo, who, after freedom had triumphed on\n3 August 1979, overthrew the dictatorship and began the real\nmarch of the country towards democracy in a climate of\npeace and harmony, which the advocates of violence wish to\ndestroy with their provocations and their contemptible plots.\nWe in Equatorial Guinea totally reject the views of the\napologists violence and their attempts to undermine national\npeace and stability. We reject those who do nothing but\ndefame our country and our Government, denigrating the\nactions that have been undertaken thus far in the country.\nA democracy imposed by foreign interests becomes\ncorrupt and falls apart. A democracy that denies the\ngenuine, traditional and sacred values of a people not only\nhurts the feelings, the pride and the honour of that people\nbut is also doomed to failure. \\\"Man is what circumstances\ndictate\\\", affirmed the great Spanish philosopher Balmes.\nThat is why only a democracy that can respond to the sacred\ninterests of the people of Equatorial Guinea will be viable in\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea. In documents A/48/307\nof 12 August 1993, A/48/330 of 19 August 1993, and\nA/48/357 of 31 August 1993, our Government presented\ninformation on the interference of certain foreign interests in\nmy country\u2019s internal affairs. From this rostrum, we are\nholding the countries responsible for that interference\nresponsible for the consequences.\nWe reaffirm that only in an atmosphere of peace is it\npossible to achieve the progress and well-being to which all\npeoples aspire. To the governmental and non-governmental\norganizations and friendly countries that, with their support,\nhave contributed to the efforts of our Government, we\nexpress our deepest appreciation, and we urge them to\ncontinue to lend their support and cooperation at this\ndecisive stage in our democratic process.\nIntelligent action in this new global society must be\nbased on the exercise of the firmest solidarity. If that is\ndone, we shall be able to say with pride, \\\"We the peoples,\nfor a better world.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to extend greetings to the President\nof the General Assembly, Ambassador Samuel Insanely of\nGuyana, to the former President, Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria,\nand to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I\ncongratulate them on their active commitment to the\nprinciples of peace, justice, human development and\ninternational law.\nI should also like to greet the Heads of State and\nrepresentatives of Member States who are gathered here in\nthis historic Hall.\nDespite having the seventh highest rate of\nhyperinflation in the history of mankind, Bolivia has been a\npioneer in the structural reforms that began in 1985 with the\nadvent of democracy and freedom - reforms that were\ncarried out without limiting human rights but by making\nmajor sacrifices. I should like to take this opportunity to\npay a tribute to the President of our country during that\nperiod, Dr. Victor Paz Estenssoro and, on behalf of all\nBolivians, to pay a special tribute to his statesmanlike\nleadership.\nIn retrospect, this may not seem so great a task:\nReining in the economic crisis and bringing about peaceful\n\nchange in conditions of freedom and liberty are activities\nthat are being accomplished in many countries in Latin\nAmerica and elsewhere in the world. The situation in\nRussia, for example, reminds us of the difficulty of\nachieving consensus and legitimacy in governing a society\nin crisis, a society in which change is necessary.\nBolivia\u2019s course has required daring and imagination.\nWe have not shrunk from calling upon our people to make\nsacrifices and shoulder additional burdens. But we are\nprofoundly alarmed, however, when we see so many\ncountries embarking on the road to democracy and change\nand attempting to achieve stable growth and development\nwith social justice and when we then note that no\ncorresponding efforts are being made in the developed\nworld.\nThe end of the cold war lit a beacon of hope, but we\nare surprised that it has not engendered an increase in\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. There was greater\ncooperation during the era of confrontation because of the\ndesire to defend third-world countries against the communist\nthreat and to replace the cold war with relations built on\nsolidarity and development. Today, on the contrary, poor\ncountries are faced with cuts in assistance, the prices of our\nraw materials continue to plummet, and protectionism is on\nthe rise. Indeed, in real terms the current prices of tin,\ntungsten, antimony, coffee, rubber and petroleum are even\nlower than they were in 1930, during the great depression.\nIt is difficult to see on this bleak horizon how we are\ngoing to solve our problems: the migration from rural to\nurban areas, and from cities to the developed world; the\nincrease in drug trafficking and the phenomenon of poor\npeople being virtually forced to destroy nature in order to\nsurvive. That creates a vicious circle, with ever-deepening\npoverty.\nThe paradox of our times is that, in a world that is\ngrowing ever richer in overall terms, poverty is on the\nincrease. There is a wider disparity between the \\\"haves\\\" and\nthe \\\"have nots\\\". The precarious stability born of internal\nsocial and economic deficiencies must be tackled by all of\nus. There is also an urgent need for basic changes in how\nwe face the problem of solidarity and the development of the\ncommunity of nations and human societies.\nDeveloped countries must realize that sooner or later\nthe present situation rewards no one and injures everyone.\nI truly believe that we must have a clear awareness of the\nfact that population growth, the doubling of the population,\nthe destruction of the environment, the production of illegal\ndrugs and the trafficking in them, the migration from poor\ncountries to rich countries are problems that will affect not\nonly those countries but the world at large.\nThe solution is greater development. We know that\nwhen people\u2019s incomes rise, when women are educated and\nwhen there is social justice, population growth rates also\nchange.\nWe know that in order to restore balance between the\nenvironment and society we need educated people who can\nput to use their special heritage and knowledge of living in\nharmony with nature - as is the case in our country.\nJust as we had to learn that nature can punish us when\nwe harm it, the time has come for all of us, developed and\nundeveloped, to become aware that it is unacceptable that\nthe rich of the world should become ever more wealthy\nwhile the poor are becoming poorer.\nAs we know, the solution is not just to hand out money\nor aid. But there is no other way to achieve our goal if we\ndo not change old ideas. The motto should be \\\"Trade, not\naid\\\". Yet it would seem that the fate of the underdeveloped\nworld is \\\"no trade and no aid\\\", which is absolutely\nunacceptable to us all if we wish to create a new, more just\nand peaceful society.\nWith the passing of time solutions will be even more\ncostly and more difficult in human terms and in social and\neconomic terms. What we need, I believe, is greater\nforesight on the part of those who are guiding the world\u2019s\ndestiny. They must find solutions that are truly effective.\nI am not saying that we should repeat the past. But in\nthe past there were plans such as the Marshall Plan that\nhelped donors and recipients alike. We need similar\napproaches. We look forward with great expectation to the\nfree trade agreement among Canada, the United States and\nMexico. We congratulate President Clinton on his\ncommitment to struggling against the forces of protectionism\nin his country and elsewhere in North America to trying to\nforge ahead.\nAs a small developing country, Bolivia views all this\nwith hope, and as a commitment that we will be able to sell\nour products to the developing countries rather than only\nsending them people.\nWe look forward to a speedy and successful conclusion\nof the Uruguay Round, as we believe that the freedom of\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 3\nopportunity to produce is the only hope for our societies.\nThe children of the world ask only that their parents be able\nto work and bring home their daily bread. But that happens\nonly when a country - a society, a world - stands together\nand gives everyone equal access and opportunity.\nWe are not asking for special treatment; we are not\nasking just for help. We are asking to be allowed to work\nand to export, and not to be obliged just to export the most\ntalented and vigorous people of our societies to the\ndeveloped world.\nIn Bolivia we are trying to forge ahead with projects\nusing foreign capital and the participation of our people. We\nare a very poor people. Our country knows that it needs\ntechnology and capital, and during the coming years we\nhope to embark on an ambitious but feasible plan.\nThis plan has three pillars: capitalization,\ndemocratization and popular participation.\nFirst, we wish to invite foreign capital to come to\ndevelop technology and use fresh resources in order to\nenrich the heritage of our State enterprises. We do not want\nto sell our heritage, and we do not want only the\nparticipation of States.\nSecondly, 50 per cent of those enterprises and\n50 per cent of the stock must be owned by all Bolivians so\nthat these Bolivians can participate in the enterprises and\nfeel included in the process of economic development.\nThirdly, many people ask \\\"How can we give free goods\nto uneducated people who do not know how to read or write,\nwho have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds?\\\" The\ntruth is that in Bolivia many people do not know how to\nread but do know how to count. They know what it means\nto participate. They know what it means to feel they are\ntaking part in the fortunes of the country. With their\nparticipation we wish to bring to poor neighbourhoods and\ncommunities the health and education the people there need\nso that they can share in management.\nThe coming millennium will no longer find that\nrepresentative democracy is enough. It must be participatory\ndemocracy. People want to participate and they will do so\nvery well when it comes to matters that directly affect their\nlives and futures.\nWe believe that with participation of this kind our\nsocieties\u2019 meagre resources will yield greater productivity.\nDemand will grow, which will make it possible for our\nsocieties to forge ahead.\nBut in Bolivia participation is not a mere word. For the\nfirst time in 500 years, a man has emerged from an\nindigenous ethnic group to become Acting President of our\ncountry. To the Bolivian people Victor Hugo C\u00e1rdenas is\nnot only an Aimara Indian, a person from the countryside,\nbut a great professional and outstanding intellectual. He\ntypifies our desire that all of our citizens take part in our\nsociety. We want to do away with age-old injustices. We\nwant to bring about change - to bring people in, not keep\nthem out. We want to create unity while respecting the\ndiversity of opinion not only on ecology and the\nenvironment but also on cultural, geographical and racial\nproblems.\nWe believe that this determination to include - not\nexclude -people is helping build a society in which there is\nchange with order, and order with change. And although we\nare among the poorest countries in Latin America - indeed,\nin the world - we believe that we stand as an example of the\nfact that it is possible to live with social peace and to regain\nstability, growth and social justice within the general\nframework of a democratic society. In Bolivia, democracy\nworks because people seek consensus; they seek respect;\nand they are accepting of diversity.\nThis process should allow us to arrive at a situation\nconducive to dealing with employment, education and health\ncare, and, most importantly, the rural sector, where the\ngreatest degree of poverty prevails and where the people are\namong the poorest in the world.\nDynamic growth would, of course, reduce the need to\ncultivate coca leaves. We in Bolivia have succeeded in\nreducing by 50 percent the amount of land used for the\ncultivation of these leaves. We accomplished this without\nthe guerrilla violence that accompanies narcotrafficking, and\nwithout the cartels that are in place in the country. While\nwe are undoubtedly making progress in this area, we are\nwell aware of the fact that the only alternative development\nactivity to this is light industry for export purposes. There\nis no use telling the Bolivian peasant, as I said earlier, to\nstop producing drugs and instead plant coffee when the price\nof coffee has dropped to half its former price, or to produce\ncacao when no one wants cacao - or rubber. Experience of\nalternative crops emphasizes the vital importance of enabling\ncountries such as Bolivia - especially Bolivia - to export\ntheir products to the developed countries in the form of\nmanufactured goods, rather than having them export the\nscourge of harmful drugs to the rest of humankind. We will\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncontinue, nevertheless, to fight against drug trafficking\nbecause we have made a commitment not only to our people\nbut also to humankind. Though we are poor, we are very\nhappy to see that new efforts are being made to reduce\ndemand. What we want to do is reduce supply. We wish\nto eliminate this business, with all its attendant dangers -\nsocial, moral, legal and institutional. Indeed, we have\nchosen the zero-option. We expect to be successful, with or\nwithout help. But we are more likely to be successful if we\nenjoy the support, cooperation and understanding of the rest\nof the world, which is, after all, affected by this terrible\nscourge.\nOurs is an ambitious project, to be sure, but it is\nfeasible. We recognize that the principal responsibility for\nthis plan rests with Bolivians. We are not just waiting for\nsomeone to help us. No, we know what all the peoples of\nthe world know, that hunger cannot wait, that solutions have\nto be found by oneself. But, in all sincerity, I think it will\nbe very difficult to overcome these problems without\ninternational cooperation. There must be some signal from\nthe outside that assistance will not come to an end as\nbarriers to trade mount.\nBolivia has made a great commitment to the\nenvironment. We have done so because our poverty stems\npartly from our neglect of this problem. We have allowed\npoverty increasingly to justify destruction of our natural\nresources in our daily activities. We do have a great plan -\na plan of international significance, not just to resolve our\nbalance-of-payments problems, not just to create an\nindustrial centre that could be the basis of the energy that we\nneed, but to see to it that environmental pollution is reduced.\nThat plan calls for construction, with Brazil, of a pipeline\nthat would bring Bolivian gas to the San Pablo market.\nWith cheap, non-polluting energy, used in industry and in\ncars, we can contribute to fundamentally reducing pollution\nin Latin America at its source, for the benefit and\ndevelopment of Bolivia, Brazil and the entire world.\nHuman rights must be the emblem of the new world\ncommunity, and we must see to it that the right to\ndevelopment within social justice is achievable. It is not just\na gift that we are asking for. We are asking for an\nopportunity. The United Nations is changing. It has to\nchange; the world has changed. After the great\nconfrontation of the cold-war period, we must deal with all\nthe harm this war caused, especially in the Third World.\nWe have to reorient global solidarity, not just in terms of\nassistance, but we must accept a concept that is truly very\nsimple and logical. Some countries become rich when they\ndo business, when they engage in trade with other rich\ncountries. To believe that a man is rich because everybody\nelse is poor is a holdover from the past. The great lesson of\nour time is that the only way to generate wealth is to help\npeople break the shackles of poverty.\nWe welcome the agreement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization. It marks the beginning of\na new era of peace and of a new spirit of global justice and\ndialogue between nations facing historic circumstances. The\nmutual recognition of the inadmissibility of acquiring\nterritory through war is a great stride forward, as is the great\nand historic lesson that, even in regions where territorial\ndisputes so stubbornly persist, civilized dialogue, common\nsense and humanity can yield results and can bring people\ntogether rather than keeping them apart.\nRecently, in the heart of Latin America, we reunited\ntwo countries - Paraguay and Bolivia - that 61 years ago\nwere split apart by war and have now decided to forge a\ncommon destiny. This has had a great impact on us,\nbecause, since the handshake - since the agreement between\nthe two countries - in our country the veterans of the Chaco\nwar have marched carrying the flag of Paraguay. If those\nwho fought, whose comrades died, are prepared to forget,\nhow could we not do likewise?\nThese enlightening examples of how the most bitter\nconflicts can be resolved evoke in us a sincere desire that\nthe same spirit should guide the search for a final solution\nto Bolivia\u2019s land-locked status, which has lasted 114 long\nyears. Many people say: \\\"How can you be claiming\nsomething that you lost 114 years ago?\\\" I reply that we\nhave a great deal of patience; our people waited 500 years\nfor their lands to be given back to them, for them to win\nback their country and their right to participate in society.\nI believe that injustice is not prescribed for us; we shall\ncontinue to make our claim, through the use of reason and\nnever by force. We shall continue to claim our right of\naccess to the sea until it is granted, until the sea runs dry.\nWhen it does, there will be no further problem and we\nshall make no further claims, but I believe that it really\nwould be an affront to go on blocking this historic coming\ntogether - which two fraternal peoples are demanding - if at\nthe Government level, at the level of leadership, we continue\nto discuss something to which both countries already want\nto find a solution. Solutions are possible; miracles do\nhappen, but we have seen that miracles are the result of\nwork and imagination, and in this we are committed, without\naggressiveness, coolly and calmly, to doing whatever we\ncan, as creatively as we can manage, to find solutions that\nwill meet the challenge and the expectations of this new\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 5\nworld in which we are living, and to bring about the change\nthat we require.\nIn these times of change, we must rely on our own\ncreativity. We know the importance of one\u2019s own efforts.\nBut at the same time we want others in this world to stand\nby us in solidarity, and at least give us the opportunity to\nshow what we can do.\nAnd we must move ahead in security along the new\npaths required by history, and we ask, and shall try to\nensure, always and with renewed vigour, that the path\nchosen is the path of solidarity, well-being, and fraternal\nrelations between peoples and countries.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first offer my\ndelegation\u2019s congratulations to Ambassador Insanally of\nGuyana on his election as President of the General Assembly\nat its forty-eighth session. His elevation to this high office\nis a fitting tribute to his personal qualities and record of\ndistinguished service to his Government and to the\ninternational community. We are confident that under his\nable guidance we will achieve substantive results in our\nwork.\nI also wish to express our deep appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for the dedicated\nmanner in which he presided over our deliberations during\nthe last session.\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\nIndonesia, I extend a warm welcome to the Czech Republic\nand the Slovak Republic as well as to Macedonia, Eritrea,\nMonaco and Andorra upon their accession to membership of\nthe United Nations. We look forward to closely cooperating\nwith them.\nBefore proceeding, I should like to convey Indonesia\u2019s\nprofound sympathy and solidarity with the Government and\npeople of India in the wake of the massive human suffering\nand destruction visited upon them by the recent devastating\nearthquake.\nThis forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\nconvened at a time of sweeping global change and transition\nsuch as has rarely been experienced in modern history. It\nhas given rise to revived hopes and new opportunities as\nwell as to new risks and uncertainties. As the rigidities of\nthe bipolar world have dissolved, earlier expectations for the\nemergence of a new world order have now given way to the\nsober realization that, instead, a new world disorder will be\nwith us for quite some time - a disorder characterized by\ncontinuing turbulence, instability and unpredictability and\noffering an often perplexing panorama of mutually\ncontradictory phenomena and processes.\nThe end of the cold war has led to a new climate in\ninternational relations and a number of encouraging trends\nand developments. Renewed confidence in multilateralism\nas a viable approach to the resolution of the crucial issues of\nour time has opened up vast new opportunities for the\nUnited Nations and a more positive phase in international\ncooperation. Better prospects have emerged for substantive\nprogress towards solutions to many regional problems long\nconsidered to be intractable. In this context, fruitful\ncooperation has been established between the United Nations\nand various regional organizations, which have acted as\npartners in facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nI therefore wholeheartedly agreed with our Secretary-General\nwhen he recently observed that multilateralism today is\nworking more effectively than ever, as it should, for in\nessence\n\\\"Multilateralism is the democracy of international\nsociety.\\\" (The New York Times, 20 August 1993,\np. A 29, \\\"Don\u2019t Make the U.N.\u2019s Job Harder\\\")\nIn South Africa the new round of negotiations which\nbegan last April has now yielded agreement on the\nestablishment of a multiracial Transitional Executive Council\nand is progressing towards democratic elections early next\nyear. Elsewhere in Africa, despite formidable difficulties\nand obstacles, practical frameworks for the resolution of\nissues have begun to take shape. In Latin America we are\ngratified to see an end to conflicts and the strengthening of\nsecurity as well as political, economic and social\ndevelopment. In the Middle East a historic breakthrough has\nbeen achieved in the Arab-Israeli peace process. And in the\nGulf region, there has been demarcation of the land border\nbetween Iraq and Kuwait, under the auspices of the United\nNations, which we hope will be a further contribution to the\nimprovement of the political and security environment in that\nregion.\nRecent developments have brought about a distinct\nimprovement in the overall political climate in the\nAsia-Pacific region as well. Relations between countries that\nwere once at odds with each other have normalized and are\nbeing continually enhanced. In Cambodia the final phase of\nthe peace process based on the Paris Agreements has been\nconsummated and has led to the rebirth of a revitalized and\ndemocratic Cambodia.\nWith the dissipation of the East-West confrontation,\nquestions relating to disarmament and security have acquired\na totally new dimension. Scenarios of deterrence have\nbecome irrelevant, while strategic premises that once guided\nnuclear-arms control and disarmament efforts have lost their\nvalidity. This quantum change has occasioned other\nencouraging developments. The successful conclusion of\nSTART II between the United States and the Russian\nFederation has significantly reduced the world\u2019s two biggest\nnuclear arsenals. Last January more than 130 countries\nsigned the Convention for the elimination of chemical\nweapons, thus proscribing the military use of these\ninstruments of death and mass destruction.\nLast month, as we observed the thirtieth anniversary of\nthe signing of the partial test-ban Treaty, I was privileged to\npreside over the special meeting of the States Parties to the\nTreaty in the context of the Treaty\u2019s Amendment\nConference. There it was resolved that the pursuit of a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test ban now taking place in the\nAmendment Conference and the Conference on Disarmament\nshould be mutually supportive and complementary. We have\nalso welcomed recent positive developments concerning\nnuclear testing, particularly the de facto moratoriums on\nnuclear tests observed by the nuclear-weapon States and\ntheir renewed commitment to work towards a comprehensive\ntest ban. Especially laudable were the decision of the United\nStates to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests until 1994,\nthe commitment of France not to be the first to resume\ntesting, and the declaration by the Russian Federation of its\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 25\nrefusal to resume testing even if others did. We hope and\nexpect that China will wish to do likewise.\nIt is indeed of critical importance that steps be taken\ntowards the expeditious conclusion of a comprehensive\ntest-ban treaty, for without it our efforts to extend the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty at its forthcoming 1995 Review\nConference may well be in jeopardy.\nAs the threat of nuclear confrontation between the\nmajor nuclear Powers has receded, the dangers of nuclear\nproliferation now appear to be their major preoccupation.\nBut, surely, the issue of non-proliferation should be\naddressed in both its horizontal and vertical aspects. It is for\nthis reason that Indonesia has unceasingly stressed the urgent\nneed for a comprehensive nuclear-test ban as the litmus test\nof our sincerity in securing non-proliferation, apart from the\nnecessity for States to submit themselves to the safeguards\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nAnother heartening development is the growing\nprominence of regional dialogues on security. The Regional\nForum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), for one, will afford the ASEAN member States\nand other South-East Asian nations, as well as the\nextra-regional Powers, a regular opportunity to exchange\nviews and consult on security issues of common concern.As\nis pointed out in the Secretary-General\u2019s report, \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\", such regional action for peace and security, as a\nmatter of decentralization, delegation and cooperation with\nthe United Nations could contribute to a deeper sense of\nparticipation,\nconsensus and democratization in international affairs.\nThese encouraging trends and developments offer\nunprecedented opportunities for enhanced international\ncooperation for peace and development. But we should\nrealize that these opportunities are fragile and fleeting in\nnature and, if not resolutely grasped, may soon be\noverwhelmed by the plethora of new problems and adverse\ntrends simultaneously emerging on the world scene.\nPersistent conflict and violence, both between and within\nStates; the virulent resurgence of ethnic strife, both ancient\nand recent; the menacing rise in religious intolerance; new\nforms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism; and the\nalarming resort to terrorism and blatant aggression: all these\ncombine to obstruct the building of a more peaceful, secure,\njust and tolerant world. These problems and trends have\nalso caused the disintegration of States and societies, which\nstands in poignant contrast to the integrative trends, based on\ngrowing interdependence, which at the same time have led\nto the coalescence of States into larger groupings for\ncommon economic and political benefits. Moreover, peace\nand security cannot be sustained unless the very concept of\nsecurity itself is expanded to embrace such non-military\nthreats as structural underdevelopment and mass poverty,\nacute resource scarcity and severe environmental\ndegradation, which together with prolonged natural disasters\nconjure up the looming spectre of massive and\nuncontrollable cross-border migrations.\nIt is a matter of grave concern that while the United\nNations is called upon to shoulder ever-expanding\nresponsibilities in the face of these new challenges, it is at\nthe same time shackled by a deepening financial crisis. If\nthis perennial financial crisis is not quickly resolved, the\nconsequences could be catastrophic for the international\ncommunity and all its aspirations to peace and development.\nIt is Indonesia\u2019s ardent desire that the United Nations\nshould become fully effective as the central instrument for\na new and revitalized international order. Steps must\ntherefore be taken to ensure not only the financial viability\nof our Organization, but also its fidelity to the dynamics of\ndemocracy which demand the fullest participation and\nengagement of all Members in the work of the Organization.\nAlong with all the non-aligned countries, Indonesia holds\nthat balance is essential in the relationship between the\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General, in conformity with their respective\nmandates as enshrined in the Charter. Indonesia and the\nother non-aligned countries have therefore done their utmost\nto contribute to the consultations leading to the adoption of\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 47/120 A and 47/120 B on\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". The Non-Aligned Movement will\ncontinue to contribute to the ongoing consultations on the\nother aspects of the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and on the\nrationalization of the Committee structures of the General\nAssembly in order to enhance its efficiency and\neffectiveness.\nFurthermore, Indonesia believes that restructuring and\nreform of the Security Council have become imperative in\nthe light of the profound changes that have taken place on\nthe international scene. We realize, however, that such a\nprocess should be carried out with caution and\ncircumspection as it impinges upon some of the fundamental\naspects of the Organization\u2019s purposes and functions. In\n1946, the United Nations had 51 Members, six of which\nwere non-permanent members of the Security Council. In\n1965, when the membership had grown to 113, there was a\ncorresponding increase in the non-permanent membership to\n10. But despite the fact that more than a quarter of a\ncentury has elapsed, during which the membership of the\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nUnited Nations has increased to 183, there has been no\nproportionate increase in the Council\u2019s membership. A\nserious review and reappraisal of the Council\u2019s membership\nis necessary to ensure a more equitable and balanced\nrepresentation. An expansion of the Council would\nstrengthen it, making it more responsive and relevant to\nprevailing geopolitical realities and more open to the\nparticipation of small and medium-sized States, which\nconstitute the majority in our Organization.\nIndonesia is also firmly of the view that an increase in\nmembership of the Council should allow for new members\nwhich, if they are not to be given the veto power, should at\nleast serve as permanent members. They should join the\nCouncil on the basis of a combination of appropriate criteria\nthat would adequately reflect the political, economic and\ndemographic realities of the world today in Asia, Africa and\nLatin America. Such a judicious approach, in addition to\none based solely on equitable geographic distribution, would\nenhance not only the Council\u2019s representative character but\nalso its moral authority and practical effectiveness.\nThe peace process in the Middle East has finally\novercome the paralysis that has gripped it over the past 10\nnegotiating sessions. Indonesia has welcomed the signing of\nthe Declaration of Principles on Palestinian interim\nself-government arrangements in the occupied territories as\na historic breakthrough in efforts to put an end to decades of\narmed conflict and confrontation and to achieve a just,\nlasting and comprehensive settlement. My Government has\nequally welcomed the agreement on a common agenda in the\ncontext of the Jordan-Israeli peace negotiations, as well as\nthe act of mutual recognition by the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel. It is also clearly understood\nthat these first steps on the Palestinian question are an\nintegral and non-prejudicial part of the entire peace process,\nwhich envisages a transitional period not to exceed five\nyears and continuing negotiations leading to a permanent\nsettlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973) in particular.\nWe applaud the fact that, with the implementation of\nthese arrangements, almost half a century of Arab-Israeli\nconfrontation and Israeli occupation of Palestine will finally\nbe coming to an end, and that the national and political\nidentity of the Palestinians will at last be universally and\nirrevocably recognized.\nAlthough the significance of these developments cannot\nbe overemphasized, we in Indonesia are aware that obstacles\nand ambiguities still abound on the long and arduous road\ntowards a just and comprehensive settlement. Above all, the\nscrupulous implementation of everything that has been\nagreed upon will be of crucial importance. Hence, there is\nan obvious need for the United Nations to play an active and\neffective role throughout the ongoing peace process.\nIndonesia reiterates its unflinching support for the struggle\nof the Palestinian people, under the leadership of the PLO,\nto secure their inalienable rights to self-determination, full\nsovereignty and independence in their own homeland.\nEqually, we call upon Israel to withdraw from all illegally\noccupied Palestinian and Arab lands, including Jerusalem,\nthe Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon.\nIn the tragedy that has engulfed Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, the international community is faced with the\nabysmally disturbing prospect of the forcible dismantling of\na multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious society, the\nbrutal decimation of its people and the gradual diminution of\nthe territory of an independent and sovereign Member State\nof the United Nations. The Security Council failed to stop\naggression and the abhorrent practice of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\"\nbecause it was unable to defend Bosnia\u2019s sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity while preventing the Bosnians from\ndefending themselves by refusing to lift an ill-conceived\narms embargo; as a result, two-thirds of Bosnian territory\nhas now come under Serbian and Croatian occupation. This\nrefusal to allow Bosnia to defend itself and to protect its\npeople from being slaughtered cannot but be regarded as a\ndenial of the right to self-defence under the Charter.\nUnder threat of a continuation of the unequal war,\nBosnia today is being coerced into accepting a settlement\nthat would partition its territory along ethnic lines and would\npractically reduce Bosnia to a cluster of small, incontiguous,\nlandlocked and perpetually vulnerable Muslim enclaves\nwithin a so-called union of the republics of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Having initially steadfastly opposed this ethnic\npartition, its Government under President Izetbegovic has\nnow reluctantly agreed to such a division. However,\nPresident Izetbegovic has done so conditionally, as part of a\ncomprehensive agreement that would ensure the legitimate\ninterests of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of its basic\nterritorial, economic and security needs, as well as with\nregard to secure access to the sea and between the\nRepublic\u2019s component parts.\nWe cannot but view these developments as representing\na blatant case of negotiation under duress and of enforcing\npeace without justice that may well lead to continuing\nviolence, human suffering and a lack of security. The force\nof law should not be surrendered to the law of force.\n\\\"Ethnic cleansing\\\" should not be rewarded, and we should\nbeware of establishing dangerous precedents that will haunt\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 27\nthe international community in the future and in other\nregions of the world. My Government, therefore, will\ncontinue to give its full support to the Government and the\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their legitimate\nstruggle to attain a just and viable settlement, with adequate\ninternational guarantees as to the political and territorial\nintegrity of the country.\nIn Somalia, it is gratifying to note that normalcy has\nbeen restored in the greater part of the country and that the\noverall situation has undergone a major transformation. But\nchaos and anarchy continue to persist, especially in\nMogadishu; this has imperiled the success of concerted\ninternational efforts to establish a stable and secure\nenvironment. We therefore sincerely hope that the leaders\nof Somalia will expeditiously seek to agree on viable\ntransitional arrangements leading to political reconciliation\nand to the establishment of a broad-based government.\nIn South Africa, it is heartening to note the determined\nefforts by the leaders of the majority to engage in peaceful\ndialogue and negotiations with the minority Government. In\na historic step towards ending decades of oppression and the\nevil of apartheid, the multi-party negotiating forum has\nscheduled 27 April 1994 as the date for the nation\u2019s first\ndemocratic elections leading towards the establishment of a\nunified, democratic and non-racial South Africa.\nIn Cambodia, in spite of the myriad difficulties it\nencountered, the peace process has now successfully\ncompleted the final stage of implementation of the Paris\nAgreements. We have wholeheartedly welcomed and\nendorsed the outcome of the elections conducted under the\nauspices of the United Nations Transitional Authority in\nCambodia (UNTAC). We have also welcomed the\ncompletion of the work of the elected Constituent Assembly\nwith the promulgation of a new democratic constitution\nestablishing a constitutional monarchy. And just a few days\nago, the Government and people of Indonesia shared the\nsense of joy and deep satisfaction at the official inauguration\nof His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman as Head of\nState, and the formation of the new Government of\nCambodia.\nWe all realize, however, that even after the expiry of\nUNTAC\u2019s mandate and the installation of the new\nCambodian Government, the United Nations and the\ninternational community should continue to support the\npeople of Cambodia in the reconstruction of their country.\nIndonesia, together with the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN), stands ready to contribute its share to this\neffort.\nIndonesia wishes to pay a tribute to His Majesty\nKing Norodom Sihanouk for his visionary leadership in\nachieving this historic watershed in Cambodia\u2019s history, in\nunifying the Cambodian people and in bringing about\nnational reconciliation. My delegation would like to express\nits gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Special\nRepresentative, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, for their contributions\nto a just and comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian\nquestion. We also pay special homage to all UNTAC\npersonnel and volunteers who sacrificed their lives in the\nperformance of their mission to bring peace to Cambodia.\nIncreasingly, the international community has come to\nrecognize that, in a world dramatically transformed since the\nend of the cold-war era, lasting peace and security can never\nbe assured in the absence of economic growth and\ndevelopment. Yet despite the profound and positive changes\nwrought in the political sphere, no corresponding\nimprovements have been registered in the world economy or\nin international economic relations. It is therefore imperative\nthat international economic cooperation and development are\naccorded top priority on the international agenda. The\ncrucial development challenges for the 1990s continue to be\nthe reinvigoration of world economic growth, the\nacceleration of the socio-economic development of the\ndeveloping countries on a sustainable basis and, above all,\nthe eradication of poverty from the face of the earth.\nBy all accounts, the world economy has failed to\nachieve substantial improvement over the past year. Belying\nalmost all official forecasts, recession in the developed\ncountries and stagnation in the developing countries have\npersisted. According to the 1993 World Economic Survey,\nworld output will be outpaced by world population growth\nrates for the third year in a row. These negative\nmacroeconomic developments have exacted an enormous toll\non the developing countries. Consequently, poverty and\nunderdevelopment remain the distinguishing features of the\nmajority of the developing countries. In the most vulnerable\neconomies, these have reached crisis proportions. Of\nespecially grave concern is the prolonged critical situation in\nAfrica, where tens of millions of people remain trapped in\nabject poverty and social deprivation.\nIn this era of increasing interdependence among nations\nand escalating globalization, issues and problems, especially\nthose relating to growth and development, have become\nglobal in nature and therefore cannot be solved through\nshort-term relief measures or through piecemeal reforms.\nTherefore, all nations, both in the North and in the South,\nshould forge a new compact on development and, through a\ndemocratic partnership, fashion global solutions to these\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nproblems. Only in that way can we hope to restructure the\ninternational economic system, redress its imbalances, and\nrender international economic cooperation more equitable\nand thus more viable and more mutually beneficial.\nThe non-aligned and other developing countries\ntherefore call for the reactivation of a constructive dialogue\nbetween the North and South. But this time, such a dialogue\nshould be based on genuine interdependence, mutuality of\ninterests and of benefits and shared responsibility. The\ndeveloping countries have expressed their readiness, both at\nthe non-aligned summit in Jakarta last September and in the\nStanding Ministerial Committee for Economic Cooperation\nin Bali last May, to engage the developed countries actively\nin a dialogue on the key issues of the world economy. In\nthis context, President Soeharto of Indonesia, as Chairman\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, in his meeting with then\nPrime Minister Miyazawa of Japan as Chairman of the\nGroup of Seven on the eve of the G-7 Summit last July,\nseized the opportunity to convey the non-aligned message,\nentitled \\\"An Invitation to Dialogue\\\", to the developed\ncountries.\nAt that meeting, the Chairman of the Group of Seven\nand the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement concurred\non the need to pursue a comprehensive approach to the\nintegrated issues of trade, investment and debt strategies,\nincluding the review of the latter through the Paris Club. In\nthis encouraging first step the initiative by the Non-Aligned\nMovement to establish a more constructive approach on\nissues of mutual concern and interest was welcomed by the\nGroup of Seven, a fact that was subsequently reflected in the\nTokyo summit economic declaration.\nIndonesia strongly believes that these positive\ndevelopments have bolstered the spirit of partnership already\narticulated and demonstrated at such meetings as the eighth\nsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD VIII) and the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED).\nThis evolving spirit of partnership should now be further\nfostered and built upon during this session of the Assembly.\nObviously, both developed and developing countries have a\nshared interest in jointly promoting this process across a\nwide spectrum of key economic issues of common concern.\nIt is important that we in the Assembly carry the process\nforward in concrete terms, and for this purpose the\nnon-aligned and other developing countries intend to submit\na draft resolution aimed at the reactivation of dialogue\nbetween the developed and the developing countries. In this\ncontext, the Secretary-General should be requested to prepare\na report on the modalities and ways and means of\nreactivating such a dialogue. We believe that this would\ncomplement his forthcoming report on an agenda for\ndevelopment, which will contain an analysis and substantive\nrecommendations on ways to enhance the role of the United\nNations in the promotion of international cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nSuch a spirit of partnership, lamentably, is conspicuous\nby its absence from some other forums, particularly the\nUruguay Round negotiations, which are still mired in an\nobdurate impasse. In this regard we sincerely hope that the\ncommitment made by the major developed countries at their\nrecent summit in Tokyo will translate into effective action\nthat will break the stalemate and bring about an equitable\nand balanced conclusion to the Round.\nAmong the most urgent issues on the global economic\nagenda is the external debt crisis of the developing countries\nwhich, contrary to perception in some quarters, is still far\nfrom being resolved and indeed continues to be exacerbated\nby volatile exchange rate fluctuations in the major\ncurrencies. Here too there is an obvious need for a\ncoordinated approach, in the spirit of partnership, involving\ndebtor and creditor nations as well as the international\nfinancial institutions. Such an approach should aim at\ndecisive reductions in the bilateral, multilateral and\ncommercial debt burdens, especially of the least developed\nand other severely indebted developing countries, in a way\nthat would at the same time allow sustained recovery and\ngrowth.\nRegrettably, all too often there has been a one-sided\nview of the causes of the debt crisis which tends to fault the\ndeveloping countries for excessive and imprudent borrowing\nand for the misuse of the resources thus obtained. This view\ntends to ignore the link between the debt crisis, the paucity\nof resource flows on appropriate terms, and the adverse turn\ntaken by the world economy since the early 1980s. This in\nturn explains the insistence on domestic policy reforms on\nthe part of the debtor countries as the principal remedial\ninstrument.\nThe truth is that the debt crisis of the developing\ncountries is a manifestation of the shortcomings of the\ninternational system in providing access to adequate longterm resources on satisfactory terms. The gap was filled by\nprivate banks, lending on inappropriate terms. The crisis\nwas triggered by deflationary policies introduced by the\ndeveloped countries. Debt-servicing became an oppressive\nburden on the borrower countries when export earnings\ndeclined following the collapse of commodity prices and\ngrowing restrictions on market access to developed countries.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 29\nIt is true that for a few middle-income countries the\ndebt crisis may be largely over. The same can be said for\nthe international commercial banks which in the past\nprovided these countries with huge amounts of loans.\nHowever, for many low-income countries as well as lowermiddle-income countries the debt crisis is far from over.\nThus around 50 severely indebted countries continue to\nexperience great difficulties in servicing their debt, at a\nterrible cost to their economies striving for recovery and\ndevelopment.\nUrgent action is needed and debt relief for these\ncountries should receive the highest priority, in particular for\nthose among the 50 countries which are the least developed\ncountries. To avoid any misunderstanding, Indonesia does\nnot regard itself as being among those 50 countries. The\nNon-Aligned Movement has made this issue one of its\npriorities in South-South cooperation and a programme is at\npresent being developed to extend concrete assistance to\nthese countries to augment their efforts at debt management.\nThe debt crisis must be considered as one of the factors\nthat led to the social crisis of the 1990s, for the latter is\nclearly a function of poverty and underdevelopment which\nin turn have given rise to internal political instability in\nmany countries.\nIn the efforts of the United Nations system and various\ncountries to address the social crisis, new and valuable\ninsights have recently been gained. It is irrefutable that in\ndeveloping countries structural changes have exacted an\nexorbitant human cost. The developed countries too have\nnot been spared from this crisis, as the prolonged recession\nhas greatly strained their social security systems. Clearly,\ntherefore, the social crisis also calls for a global approach,\nand indeed a consensus is growing that development and\ninternational cooperation \\\"should put people first\\\".\nIndonesia shares this view and fully commits itself to\nthe active participation of the people in the decision-making\nprocesses involved in development, and to the protection and\npromotion of human rights in all their manifestations,\nincluding the right to development. We therefore look\nforward to participating actively in such forthcoming\nconferences as the World Summit for Social Development in\n1995 and the World Conference on Women in the same\nyear. The World Conference on Population and\nDevelopment to be held in Cairo early next year should\nprovide an occasion for the international community to\ncooperate on the basis of the essential linkages between\ndevelopment, population and environmental protection. The\nproposal to convene an international conference on financing\nfor development should be given serious consideration. We\nanticipate the forthcoming report by the Secretary-General\non an agenda for development will mark an important\nmilestone in international cooperation for development.\nWith this report we hope that development will finally be\naccorded as much emphasis as that given to the political\nagenda.\nA short time ago, the World Conference on Human\nRights was convened in Vienna. Surpassing most\nexpectations, the Conference adopted a Declaration and\nProgramme of Action which affirmed, among other things,\nthe principles of universality, indivisibility and\nnon-selectivity in the promotion and protection of human\nrights. We are heartened by the fact that the Vienna\nConference recognized that in the promotion of human rights\nand fundamental freedoms, the significance of national and\nregional particularities and the various historical, cultural and\nreligious backgrounds of States must be taken into account.\nApproved by consensus, the Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action represents a new paradigm from which\nto promote human rights in a non-selective, cooperative and\nbalanced manner. That being the case, the use of human\nrights as political conditionalities for economic cooperation\nis entirely against the agreements reached in Vienna.\nThis session of the General Assembly has been asked\nto consider the establishment of a post of high commissioner\nfor human rights. It is Indonesia\u2019s considered view that such\nconsideration should lay emphasis on the practical feasibility\nof establishing this post and on whether such action would\nin reality and practice enhance the promotion and protection\nof human rights as called for in the United Nations Charter.\nFor it may be more beneficial to direct our attention to\nenhancing the authority and efficacy of the existing\nmechanisms and bodies, particularly the Centre for Human\nRights in Geneva.\n\nThe end of the cold war has opened a new chapter in\nthe history of humankind, a chapter full of portents as well\nas bright promise. The essential text of this chapter is yet\nto be written, in this Assembly and in the various\ninternational forums where crucial issues are taken up. As\nthe principal international institution for multilateral\ncooperation and negotiation, the United Nations has a central\nrole in the shaping and fulfilment of that promise. All\nnations, developed and developing alike, can and should\nhave a part in realizing that promise through constructive\ndialogue and democratic cooperation. In the course of this\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nendeavour, the vision and aspirations of the developed and\nthe developing countries can be forged into a broad and\ndynamic partnership that would effectively address the\nproblems of today and successfully confront the challenges\nof tomorrow. We hope that this process has now made a\nmodest but significant beginning.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating President Insanally of Guyana on his election\nto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. I feel confident that under his guidance we shall\nsucceed in strengthening the United Nations and establishing\npeace and prosperity.\nThe number and importance of the challenges facing\nthe United Nations after its almost 50 years of existence call\nfor reforms. The number of Members is increasing. Now\nthat the cold war has ended, the United Nations, and notably\nthe Security Council, is in a better position than ever to\nfunction as foreseen in the Charter. The peoples of the\nworld are looking more and more to the United Nations to\nsolve their conflicts. The United Nations is expected to\nbring political stability and economic prosperity to all parts\nof the world. The United Nations is expected to play a\nleading role in surmounting the poverty gap. It is expected\nto secure ecologically sustainable development. The United\nNations is expected to provide development assistance,\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 29\nenvironmental assistance and emergency assistance. It is\nexpected to play a leading role in securing democracy and\nrespect for human rights, including women\u2019s and children\u2019s\nrights. It is expected to bring relief to refugees and\ndisplaced persons. And the United Nations is expected to\nprevent the spread of the means of mass destruction.\nReform of the United Nations is necessary to meet\nthese challenges. Let me concentrate on seven items on the\nreform agenda.\nFirst, Denmark attaches particular importance to the\nrole of the Security Council as stated in the Charter. The\nefficiency of the Council in making decisions during the\nrecent past has raised new expectations as to its ability to\nrespond to crises.\nIt is therefore important to ensure that the Council\nmembership reflects the situation of today. The Government\nof Denmark recognizes that the developing countries have a\ncase for improving their representation. We also recognize\nthat there are countries with global influence and\nresponsibilities that may wish to see this acknowledged in\nthe composition of the Security Council. Those Member\nStates will, I am sure, also assume a special responsibility\nvis-\u00e0-vis the activities of the United Nations and, in\nparticular, to contribute politically, militarily and financially\nto the implementation of the Council\u2019s decisions.\nAs my second point I wish to recall that Denmark has\nalways participated actively in the peace-keeping operations\nof the United Nations. Consequently, it stands ready to\ndiscuss how to strengthen the Organization in the area of\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. The\nNordic countries intend to follow this question with\nparticular interest with a view to putting forward proposals\nduring this session of the Assembly.\nThe deployment of a largely Nordic peace-keeping\nforce in Macedonia is a concrete example of preventive\ndeployment. In addition, Denmark is setting up a reaction\nbrigade of 4,500 soldiers. They could be deployed in peace-\nkeeping, peacemaking and humanitarian United Nations\noperations. We are ready to make part of that force\navailable for the United Nations stand-by force arrangement.\nThe stand-by force arrangement could be vital in improving\nthe planning, reducing the lead-time and increasing the\nflexibility in the peace-keeping field.\nDenmark supports a more active role for the United\nNations in conflict prevention and crisis management. I\nwelcome the fact that some of the recommendations in \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\" in this respect have already been\nimplemented.\nThirdly, the World Conference on Human Rights in\nJune this year in Vienna reaffirmed the universal character\nof human rights. The conference also focused on the human\nrights of women, and rightly so: women\u2019s rights are human\nrights.\nThe General Assembly should decide to establish the\npost of high commissioner for human rights, as\nrecommended by that Conference. We should also take\nsteps substantially to increase the resources for the United\nNations human rights programme, including the United\nNations Centre for Human Rights.\nThere are times when the principle of non-interference\nin the internal affairs of a Member State must yield to a\ndecision by the international community to secure respect for\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, such as freedom\nfrom hunger and protection from genocide. Furthermore, the\nright of the civilian population to receive humanitarian\nassistance must also be respected, regardless of national\nfrontiers.\nDenmark fully supports efforts to secure the safety and\nprotection of United Nations personnel operating in areas of\narmed conflict.\nFourthly, we also need a strong United Nations in the\neconomic and social fields. The United Nations must\nrespond effectively to the economic and social needs of the\ndeveloping countries. There can be no lasting peace and\nsecurity unless the growing inequalities are addressed. The\n\\\"agenda for development\\\" to be drafted in the coming year\nby the Secretary-General will, it is hoped, contribute to\nsetting the priorities for the United Nations for the twenty-\nfirst century.\nBy attaining the accepted United Nations targets for\nofficial development assistance - 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product and within that 0.15 per cent to the least\ndeveloped countries - we would dramatically increase the\nvolume of support for the developing countries. That would\nalso clearly demonstrate the world\u2019s commitment to deal\nseriously with its economic and social problems.\nFifthly, as is well known, Denmark contributes\nsubstantially to United Nations development activities. Our\ncontributions must be used to the optimum benefit of\ndeveloping countries and not lost in bureaucracy and\ninefficiency. We must convince donors that the United\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNations and its funds and programmes can serve as efficient\nchannels for a large part of their development assistance. If\nnot, other channels will increasingly be used. Member\nStates must demonstrate their commitment to fundamental\nreform - not just window-dressing.\nDuring the past year a compromise solution for\nrestructuring and revitalizing the United Nations in the\neconomic and social fields was carefully negotiated, but\nfinally not agreed upon. The Government of Denmark\ndeeply regrets this situation. We sincerely hope that it will\nbe remedied by this session of the General Assembly.\nSixthly, it must be recognized that social peace is as\nimportant as strategic peace. We see the World Summit for\nSocial Development to be held in Copenhagen in March\n1995 as an opportunity to put people at the centre of\ndevelopment. To us, democratic practices and fair\ndistribution of resources are closely related to dynamic\neconomic development.\nThe Copenhagen Summit and the fourth World\nConference on Women will both mark the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations in 1995. The preparations\nfor the women\u2019s Conference should lead to a substantial\ninput for the Copenhagen Summit. Likewise, the outcome\nof the Copenhagen Summit ought to be a strong message\nfrom the world\u2019s leaders signalling their commitment to\nclosing the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s social and\neconomic opportunities.\nMy seventh point concerns the Secretariat. Since he\ntook office the Secretary-General has carried out a number\nof changes in the Secretariat. I commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for these changes and assure him of our support in\nhis efforts to make the Secretariat more efficient.\nAll efforts should be undertaken to eradicate corruption,\nwaste and mismanagement in the Secretariat. I welcome the\nestablishment of the post of Assistant Secretary-General for\nInspections and Investigations. This is the first step towards\nthe creation of the post of Inspector-General. But such\ninitiatives cannot of themselves solve the financial crisis of\nthe United Nations. That requires that Member States pay\ntheir assessed contributions on time and in full. That is one\nof the basic requirements for membership of the\nOrganization.\nI fail to understand how Member States, including some\nof the permanent members of the Security Council, can call\nfor United Nations assistance, including in peace-keeping\noperations, and then not pay. This leaves the United Nations\nunable to perform vital functions. It also leaves troop -\ncontributors such as Denmark with the problem that the\nUnited Nations does not honour its financial obligations to\nus - that is, to repay expenses for Danish United Nations\npersonnel and equipment.\nLet me now turn to a few current problems facing the\nworld and the United Nations.\nIn the Middle East we are witnessing a historic\nbreakthrough. I pay tribute to the Israelis and the\nPalestinians for having taken this step towards a\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution. I commend\nNorway for its role in bringing about this agreement.\nI also welcome the fact that Israel and Jordan have\nsigned an agenda for further negotiations. I hope that\nprogress will soon be made in the Israeli-Syrian and\nIsraeli-Lebanese tracks of the peace process.\nAmple support, both economic and political, is essential\nto keep momentum, and must be provided by the\ninternational community. Denmark, at an early stage,\ntogether with the other Nordic countries, decided to pledge\na substantial amount. We have also demonstrated our\ncommitment to the developments in the Middle East region\nthrough the European Community, the major donor in this\ncontext.\nIn contrast, it is with dismay we see the developments\nin the former Yugoslavia. The international community\nshould accept only a solution reached by peaceful means and\nnegotiations. In this connection, I pay tribute to the tireless\nefforts of Lord Owen and Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg.\nThe solution to the crises must respect the\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina. We cannot accept a territorial solution\ndictated by Serbs and Croats at the expense of the Bosnian\nMuslims. It is extremely important now that all parties show\nthe necessary flexibility in order to arrive at a solution they\nall can freely agree to. Such an arrangement must ensure\nthe protection of human rights and the rights of minorities.\nSanctions will remain in place until conditions for their\nlifting have been met. They should not be eased before a\npeace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is under faithful\nimplementation by the Serbian side. Future attempts to\nhinder humanitarian aid and the guaranteed free passage of\nconvoys are unacceptable and will have serious\nconsequences for relations between the party responsible and\nthe European Community.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 31\nBy its resolution 827 (1993), the Security Council\ndecided to establish the International Tribunal for the\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of\nInternational Humanitarian Law committed in the Territory\nof the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. Denmark strongly\nsupports this decision.\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia is probably the\nmost difficult task taken on by the United Nations in its\nhistory. Denmark participates in the United Nations\nProtection Force with almost 1,300 peace-keepers and has\nmade substantive contributions to the European Community\nMonitoring Mission. Large numbers of Danes are also\ninvolved in the humanitarian work carried out under the\nauspices of the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees. In addition, Denmark has made\nlarge financial contributions to the various international relief\nprogrammes and through Danish non-governmental\norganizations.\nResponding to the calls for swift and effective\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 836 (1993) on\nsafe areas, the Nordic countries have decided to field a joint\nNordic United Nations battalion group of about 1,300 men\nto protect the safe areas around Tuzla in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The force is expected to be ready for\ndeployment in October. That decision is evidence of the\nwillingness of the Nordic countries to make their\ncontribution to resolving the tragic conflict and protect the\ncivilian population from the horrors of war.\nIn the African continent, we see both hope and\ncontinued distress, regional conflicts and violations of basic\nhuman rights.\nAs Mr. Nelson Mandela eloquently told the Special\nCommittee against Apartheid last Friday, historic advances\ntowards democracy in South Africa have been achieved. I\nwelcome his call to lift the economic and diplomatic\nsanctions vis-\u00e0-vis his country. I also share his view that\nthis will give added impetus to the process, and strengthen\nthe forces, of democratic change.\nI wish to recall the decision of the European\nCommunity and its member States on 8 June 1993 to adjust\ntheir policy towards South Africa concurrently with\ndevelopments towards majority rule and democracy.\nDenmark stands ready to support South African efforts\nto normalize relations with the United Nations. The United\nNations, for its part, should support South Africa during its\ndifficult transitional period. An urgent priority should be to\nsupport the first democratic elections. It is essential that\nthey be free and fair. I can only echo Mr. Mandela\u2019s call\nlast week to the Security Council to consider how the United\nNations can best support South Africa in this endeavour. It\nmust be ensured that this last mile on the road to democracy\nis successful. Denmark intends to make a substantial\ncontribution. We will also - once the Transitional Executive\nCouncil has been established - initiate a programme of\ntransitional assistance to South Africa amounting to\napproximately 600 million Danish kroner, or about $100\nmillion.\nThe level of violence in South Africa remains\nunacceptably high; it is the single most serious threat to the\nprocess. We appeal to all parties to make every effort to\nstop the violence. The international community should\ncontinue to support such efforts.\nIn Somalia the situation is still very grave. The\ndeplorable actions in the form of continued attacks directed\nagainst the United Nations Operation in Somalia forces and\nrelief and aid personnel cannot be condemned strongly\nenough. All parties in the civil strife must understand that\nviolence does not pay in the long run. We support the\nefforts by the United Nations to bring about a negotiated\nsettlement in Somalia as well as the efforts to relieve the\nsuffering of the people.\nCivil strife and violations of the most basic human\nrights have characterized the Sudan for far too long. The\nSecretary-General has appointed a Special Envoy\nHumanitarian Affairs for the Sudan. Denmark urges all\nparties to seek political solutions to the problems of the\ncountry. We fully support the work of the Special Envoy as\nwell as other steps to redress the prevailing situation,\nincluding the violation of human rights.\nDenmark congratulates the people of Cambodia on the\nhistoric and successful elections for a Constituent Assembly\nand on that Assembly\u2019s presentation of a new constitution.\nThe impressively high voter participation and the Constituent\nAssembly\u2019s dedication in fulfilling its task constitute a\nvictory for democracy and for the peace process.\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General, the United\nNations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and\nparticipating international polling-station officers for their\nenormous effort and hard work.\nThe international community must continue its support\nfor the peace process and for the reconstruction of\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nCambodia. I can confirm Denmark\u2019s commitment in that\nrespect.\nThis year, 1993, is the International Year of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People. The Government of Denmark\nwishes to promote indigenous peoples\u2019 own organizations\nwith a view to their full participation in political, economic,\nsocial and cultural life. In collaboration with the Home Rule\nGovernment of Greenland, we support all efforts to increase\nawareness of the special situation facing indigenous peoples,\nincluding the Inuit of Greenland.\nA particular concern of Denmark is that the indigenous\npeoples who have been permanent residents of the Arctic for\nmillenniums are at risk from environmental degradation. On\n16 September 1993 the Government of Denmark and the\nHome Rule Government of Greenland hosted the second\nMinisterial Conference on the Arctic Environment, at Nuuk,\nthe capital of Greenland. In the Nuuk Declaration, adopted\nand signed at that Conference, the eight Arctic countries\nrecognized the special role of indigenous peoples in\nenvironmental management and in development in the Arctic\nand the significance of their knowledge and traditional\npractices. The Government of Denmark will establish and\nfund a secretariat to promote the indigenous peoples\u2019\neffective participation in the Arctic Environmental Protection\nStrategy and in the achievement of sustainable development\nin the Arctic.\nIn conclusion, let me state that there is no alternative to\nour United Nations. Only the United Nations has the\nnecessary legitimacy to undertake humanitarian action,\npeace-keeping operations, the creation of an international\ntribunal, and assistance to suffering peoples around the\nworld.\nAt the same time, the need for reforms in the United\nNations is evident. The job facing all of us as Member\nStates is to agree in concrete terms on such reforms. We\nmust show that behind the words spoken from this rostrum\nlies a will to enable the United Nations to serve the many\nfunctions we the peoples are asking for.\n"

We are proud of this\nachievement, and we encourage all those who would to\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nfollow our example of freedom, justice and peace, buttressed\nby sound principles of human and national development.\nWe have yet another reason for celebration. Your\nunanimous election to the presidency of this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly, Sir, is an historic occasion\nnot only for you personally and for your great country but\nalso for every Caribbean Government and person.\nBahamians, together with all Caribbean peoples, therefore\npay high tribute to you and to your country. We are fully\nconscious of your impeccable and enviable credentials as a\ndiplomat, and we are satisfied that those same skills will\nserve to guide us through this session, despite its challenges,\nto successful and lasting results.\nPermit me also to pay high tribute to your predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for his outstanding\ncontributions to the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. His presidency witnessed significant\nachievements and today we are the beneficiaries of his\nvisionary leadership.\nWhile we who are privileged to represent our\nGovernments have the luxury of pronouncing international\npolicies, the Secretary-General enjoys no such luxury. His\nis the responsibility of going beyond the rhetoric to the\nsubstance of the many resolutions and decisions which we\nadopt in this Assembly each year. His task is therefore\ndauntingly complex. Nevertheless, he has borne his\nenormous responsibilities with great dignity and high\ndistinction.\nIn this connection, we cannot help but recall the biblical\ninjunction: \\\"Out of Egypt have I called my Son\\\". (The\nHoly Bible, Matthew 2:15) Like his predecessor, he has\nperformed beyond our expectations, and is deserving of our\npraise for his proficiency in assisting this Organization in\nshaping contemporary history so dramatically.\nAt this juncture I wish to take this opportunity to\nextend the deepest sympathy of the Government and the\npeople of the Bahamas to the people and the Government of\nIndia, who suffered such tragic loss of life and property\nduring the recent devastating earthquake, and to reaffirm our\nsolidarity with them during this time of national disaster.\nIt would be very easy for me on behalf of my\nGovernment and country to rehearse the developments of the\npast year and offer the members of the Assembly some\nobservations. However, we believe that a focus on the\nfuture is more timely.\nAs we near the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization,\nit is the view of the Bahamas that that significant turning-\npoint should be seized as an opportunity to assess where we\nare and what is required to move further ahead in the\nfulfilment of the principles of the Charter, so that the\nforthcoming anniversary will indeed be cause for celebration.\nIn reflecting on what is required to move ahead, we\ninvite all Member States to focus with us on how each one\nof us, given our varied capacities, can assist the Organization\nin moving closer to the full achievement of the principles\nenshrined in the Charter.\nThere is no question that the United Nations, in its\noften unappreciated role in the promotion of such objectives\nas international cooperation and respect for human rights,\nhas been vindicated in this approach by successes far beyond\nexpectations.\nIn the political sphere, such successes include the\nfostering of a shift to democracy in Eastern Europe; the\ndramatic reduction, through voluntary destruction, of nuclear\nweapons; the Mission of the Organization of American\nStates (OAS) and United Nations in Haiti; the establishment\nof the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former\nYugoslavia since 1991; the establishment of the Transitional\nExecutive Council in South Africa; the very recent signing\nof the historic peace accord between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO), as well as the Declaration of\nPrinciples between Israel and Jordan; and the repelling of\naggression and the restoration of sovereignty in Kuwait. In\nthis context, the Security Council resolution that determines\nthe Kuwaiti boundary must be respected.\nIn addressing the hurdles which must be overcome\nbefore lasting solutions are achieved, we believe that more\nemphasis should also be placed on the expanded economic,\nsocial and military role of the United Nations. That role is\ndemonstrated by the peace-keeping forces dispatched\nglobally and by the recent successful Conferences on\nEnvironment and Development and Human Rights, as well\nas by the forthcoming conferences on women, population\nand development, the Summit for Social Development and,\nmost importantly for the Bahamas, the forthcoming\nConference on Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, scheduled to be held at Barbados in 1994.\nThe Bahamas places particular emphasis on the role of\nthe United Nations in the economic and social fields and\nfully expects that the revitalized United Nations will provide\nan enhanced capacity for the Organization to perform that\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 7\nimportant role. It is in this context, therefore, that we\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General to restructure the\nOrganization in the economic and social fields.\nAs members are aware, success invariably brings\ngreater responsibilities and challenges. Indeed, these greater\nresponsibilities, challenges, and even attendant impediments,\nhave regrettably already begun to sour the excitement of the\nmany achievements attained. But we must not let this\nreverse side of success debilitate us. We must remain\nfocused so that narrower vested interests do not hinder the\nachievement of goals set in the wider interest. We must\npermit no circumstance to impede the earliest cessation of\nthe atrocities of war for a return to peaceful settlement of\ndisputes. We must be sensitive to and respond practically,\nin the spirit of the Charter, to national needs, pressures and\ncivil unrest. The call for regional action in the settlement of\ndisputes and peace-keeping will also need to be further\nemphasized as we seek to maintain the integrity of the\nOrganization.\nIn this connection, we particularly underscore the need\nfor the fullest support of the implementation of the\nGovernors Island Accord on the restoration of democracy in\nHaiti, not only on the basis of unrelenting moral pressure\nbut, equally, through material and technical assistance\ntowards fostering the economic revitalization and enduring\nhealth of that country\u2019s democratic institutions.\nWhile the unpleasant spectacle of politics through\nconflict has reasserted itself at the centre of the world stage,\nregrettably, politics has two companions, which often\ninfluence it, though rarely gaining the same degree and\nmagnitude of attention given to politics. These two\ncompanions are economic and social tensions. We must\never be vigilant of these two, often unruly companions.\nAgain, we must find our focus in the purposes and principles\nof the Charter.\nAgainst that background, there are several questions I\nfeel must be put as part of the deliberations we will\nundertake during this session.\nFirst, is the peace dividend releasing adequate resources\nand civilian expertise to impact developmental needs?\nSecondly, should life after self-determination for the\nnewer members of the international community provoke\nstagnant growth in those less-recently sovereign?\nThirdly, is there sufficient retraining and assistance to\nensure that the trade liberalization facilitated by megablocs\npromotes fair, democratic and transparent institutional\nstrengthening and the widest empowerment?\nAnd, lastly, how do we ensure that environmental\nawareness, as a catalyst for a better quality of life globally,\ndoes not become yet another trade conditionality?\nThese questions are being posed because, if they are\nneglected or inadequately addressed, the new world order\nwill be but a shifting of power centres and a spawning of\nnew seeds of international economic, social and political\ninstability.\nIn many countries, including the Bahamas, social\ntensions are reordering national priorities. We must return\nto basics in dealing with problems of a pandemic nature,\nsuch as poverty, illicit drugs, crime, violence, international\nterrorism, human rights violations and disease, especially the\nurgent necessity for dealing with the devastations caused by\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\nThroughout this global village our Member States are\nfacing the disintegration of the traditional family values,\ncoupled with rampant unemployment. We must\nre-emphasize those spiritual values which respect life, the\ndignity and worth of the human person and his or her\nimportance to national life and development. In order that\nour peoples will avoid hopelessness and survive the adverse\neffects of economic decline, we must share more directly the\nburden of action for solutions with those community\ninstitutions and social partners which are the teachers and\nthe examples of positive spiritual and moral values.\nFundamentally, the Bahamas remains morally persuaded\nof, and financially committed to, the goals and worth of the\nUnited Nations. To underscore this commitment, The\nBahamas has recently deposited instruments of accession to\ninternational agreements in some of the priority areas on the\nUnited Nations agenda, including the International Covenant\non Civil and Political Rights, The International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the\nElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women\nand the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and\nwe shall shortly sign the chemical weapons Convention. In\nreality, the approaches and solutions found in these\nConventions have long been traditional Bahamian policy and\npractice.\nDespite a 100 per cent increase in the regular budget\nassessment for the Bahamas over the past five years, we\nremain unwavering in our acceptance of the necessary\nsharing of the financial burden in order that this\nOrganization may achieve its objectives. On the other hand,\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe Bahamas wishes to have consideration given to the level\nof its assessment, and in that process we shall be submitting\nevidence that our reputed comparatively high per capita\nincome not only masks the true indigenous per capita\nincome situation, but also belies the increasing demands\narising from the development needs of our widely scattered\narchipelago. We submit that, given these circumstances,\nthere ought to be some mitigation available to the Bahamas,\ngiven these circumstances.\nThe Bahamas is very cognizant that we remain one of\nthe few cases of comparative political tranquillity and\nunassailed natural beauty. Our commitment to the\nmaintenance of national unity and the preservation of the\nenvironment is unwavering. We therefore believe that the\nBahamas is ideally suited as a propitious setting for difficult\nnegotiations, and we offer the Organization our facilities,\nwhich, we are convinced, will enhance the conduct of such\naffairs. We further pledge our commitment to contribute, to\nthe extent possible, to making operational the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" and Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s proposed agenda for development. We see these\nagenda items as practical approaches to dealing with\nproblem-solving for conflict resolution, peace-keeping and\npost-conflict peace-building, and poverty alleviation.\nAs we approach the fiftieth year of our Organization\u2019s\nexistence, to ensure even better years ahead our watchwords\nshould be \\\"perspective\\\" and \\\"purpose\\\": perspective in not\nlosing sight of the goals of our founding fathers, who\nemphasized the primacy of people in the preamble to our\nCharter; and purpose in recognizing and accepting that the\nmeans for, and the road to, the end of international disorder\nand insecurity must begin with the individual. Our initially\nseparate personal attitudes, motives and actions ultimately\ndetermine whether there will be an international climate for\npeace or one for disorder. The success of our Organization\nis therefore dependent, at one and the same time, on our\ninternational, collective and personal actions.\nIn our Caribbean corner of this global village, the\nBahamas continues its efforts in the struggle to bring about\npeace and democracy in neighbouring Haiti. The success of\nthis process will permit our own social and economic\nlandscape to be relieved of the extra burden of caring for the\nthousands of illegal immigrants from that country who defy\nthe sometimes harsh elements of nature in search of a safe\nhaven in our relative paradise.We trust that the world - and\nespecially the Member States of this Organization - has\ntaken due note of the enormous weight imposed upon our\nsmall country by this undertaking. The Bahamas has well\ndemonstrated its concern and care for its neighbours of the\nRepublic of Haiti. I call to mind the famous statement by\none of the young residents of Father Flanagan\u2019s Boys\u2019 Town\nUnited States of America . When asked about the concern\nand care he demonstrated for his brother he replied, \\\"He\nain\u2019t heavy, Father; he\u2019s my brother\\\". The fact is, our\nbrother is heavy, but we bear him gladly, in Christian\ncharity, and in full and great expectation of imminent peace\nin Haiti.\nOur Bahamas remains proudly and immovably in\nleague with this great Organization.\n"

        "file_text": " I\nam delighted to be addressing the General Assembly as the\npeople of Guinea commemorate a historic date: 28\nSeptember 1958, the day on which Guinea, by a unanimous\nvote, chose national independence and sovereignty, thus\naccelerating the process of liberation of the African peoples.\nIt will be easy, then, to understand the pride and\npleasure I take on this anniversary in conveying a message\nof peace and friendship from the people of Guinea and from\ntheir President, General Lansana Cont\u00e9.\nI join previous speakers in congratulating Ambassador\nInsanally on his dazzling election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish also to assure\nhim of my delegation\u2019s complete support as he carries out\nhis responsible tasks. His personal qualities, his wealth of\nexperience and the valuable assistance of his fellow-officers -\nwhom I also congratulate - bode well for the success of our\nwork.\nI wish also to convey to the President of the Assembly\nat its forty-seventh session, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\nGanev of Bulgaria, my great appreciation for the skill and\ndedication with which he guided the work of that session.\nFinally, my delegation highly appreciates the\npraiseworthy efforts made by the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has worked\ntirelessly to build and maintain peace in the face of all the\nobstacles in his way.\nThe independence of the sister republic of Eritrea and\nits admission to membership of the Organization were a\nsource of great relief for its people and of genuine\nsatisfaction for the international community. I welcome\nEritrea and wish it great success in its difficult task of\nnational reconstruction.\nI welcome the admission of Eritrea, and that of the\nCzech Republic, Slovakia and the Principalities of Monaco\nand Andorra; this confirms the increasingly universal\ncharacter of our Organization.\nThe end of the cold war radically changed world\ngeopolitics through a rapid series of often unforeseeable\nevents. While it is possible to believe that the threat of a\nglobal conflagration has been lifted, we note with dismay the\nproliferation and exacerbation of armed conflicts that are\ncausing immense loss of life, great destruction of\ninfrastructure and property, and severe suffering among\ncivilians suffering the agony of exile, famine and sickness.\nWhat a paradox! On the one hand, the international\ncommunity is making intense efforts to prevent or contain\narmed conflicts, and on the other hand international action\nis not being provided with the resources it needs to eliminate\nthe causes and the manifestations of those conflicts. That is\na salient feature of today\u2019s international relations.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 33\nIn short, more resources are needed to restore world\npeace.\nNone the less, it is reassuring that recent history has\nfavoured the renaissance of the United Nations; thanks to\nchanged attitudes and perceptions, the Organization has truly\nbecome the guarantor of peace at a difficult moment in\ninternational relations.\nThe positive trends that we have seen here and there in\nfinding solutions to political problems ought to have\npromoted an improvement in the economic and social\nsituation in many countries. However, in most developing\ncountries, that situation has instead deteriorated seriously.\nThe increase in the number of international forums debating\ndevelopment programmes has unfortunately not made it\npossible to reverse the trend towards the imbalances that I\nhave mentioned.\nToday, world savings are under severe pressure. What\nis happening is that the supply of capital for development is\ninadequate relative to the ever-increasing demand from the\nAfrican countries, especially if we take into account the new\nneeds of the Eastern countries, which are in the throes of\ntransition. The world economic crisis is still going on; it is\naggravating the disparities and the already precarious\nconditions for development being experience by the third\nworld countries.\nFor Africa, this crisis has been heightened by drought\nand desertification, by the stagnation - for which, read\nreduction - in official development assistance, by the\ndeterioration in terms of trade and its corollary, the marked\ndrop in export earnings, by the counter-productive effects of\nstructural adjustment programmes and by the external debt\nburden.\nAllow me to place a particular emphasis on this last\nissue. Members will recall that the seriousness of the\nindebtedness problem led the African Heads of State or\nGovernment to propose holding a special summit on African\ndebt. This problem is today still as widespread and as acute\nas it was before, despite the relief measures undertaken by\nsome creditors. The international community must be\npersuaded of the fact that so long as the question of\nindebtedness is not studied in a global, concerted manner,\nthe socio-economic development programmes of the third\nworld will be put in jeopardy as a result.\nThe lack of resources for development has as its\ncorollary the mass exodus from the countries of the South to\nthe countries of the North; indeed, the only viable solution\nto this migratory phenomenon lies in economic recovery in\nthe countries of the South.\nEnvironmental problems - the relationship between man\nand his environment - have in recent years quite rightly been\na major concern of the international community. Do I need\nto stress the fact that man, through his nature-destroying\nactivities, has heightened the progressive degradation of our\nworld to the point where the alarm bells we hear today are\nsounding?\nIn the past, man was essentially a passive spectator of\nthe natural wear and tear on the ecological system. Today\nhe has become the main player in the destruction of the\nnatural environment through the combined effects of the\ninappropriate design and implementation of a number of\nprogrammes, through the improper use of science and\ntechnology and as a result of runaway population growth.\nIn contrast, real development must also embrace\nprotection of the environment and the ecological balance.\nThis is precisely why my delegation is emphasizing the need\nfor follow-up to the decisions in the Rio Declaration and\nAgenda 21. Environmental protection is a common\nresponsibility; all nations must contribute to it.\nEnvironmental damage, whether man-made or from natural\ncauses, spares no region on Earth.\nMy country, which used to enjoy good rainfall and was\ncalled the watershed of Western Africa, is concerned to see\nits rainfall and the rate of flow of its natural watercourses\ndiminish. This is why my Government is interested - in\nmore than one sense - in the negotiations that are taking\nplace within the high-level Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment on drafting an international convention to\ncombat desertification and drought in the countries that are\nbeing seriously affected.\nThe persistence of a number of political crises,\nincluding those in southern Africa, Somalia, Liberia, Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and elsewhere, is a threat to the peace and\nsecurity of mankind.\nFortunately, there is positive progress in South Africa,\nwhere a clear awareness appears to have taken hold\nconcerning the vital need to build a democratic and multi-\nracial society. The establishment of a Transitional Executive\nCouncil, as well as the demonstrations for peace by civilian\nsociety and a certain degree of political awareness, are cause\nfor optimism, despite some reluctance.\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThis remarkable improvement in the political climate,\nwhich has been achieved, inter alia, as a result of the spirit\nof compromise shown by the various political players, makes\nit possible, in my delegation\u2019s opinion, for the economic\nsanctions against South Africa to be lifted, as president\nNelson Mandela of the African National Congress himself\nhas requested.\nThat being the case, there is reason for great\nsatisfaction in the activities of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) which, through its observer missions and its\nAd Hoc Committee on Southern Africa, has contributed\ngreatly, in collaboration with the United Nations, to the\npeaceful change that has taken place in South Africa.\nIn Angola, after lighting a glimmer of hope, the process\nof national reconciliation seems to be blocked by the\nincreased fighting resulting from UNITA\u2019s intransigence.\nBut only observance by the parties of the Bicesse Accords\nand of the election results will allow the Angolan people to\nregain peace and security. The Security Council\u2019s decision\non 15 September 1993 recommending the application of\nsanctions against UNITA must be strengthened and\nimplemented strictly, because only constant firmness with\nUNITA and its leader will make it possible to put an end to\nthis painful civil war that is sowing death and destruction.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the parties\nconcerned must cooperate with the Secretary-General and\nwith all willing parties in order to implement the peace plan,\nwhich is vital for there to be a happy ending to this crisis.\nFor almost four years now, Liberia has been the theatre\nfor one of the bloodiest civil wars on our continent. The\nrefusal by some of the parties to the conflict to compromise\nhas caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people\nand considerable material destruction, not to mention the\nmassive outpouring of refugees and displaced persons, in\nparticular into neighbouring countries, including my own,\nwhich is at present harbouring some 600,000.\nHowever, it is a source of comfort to note that the\nnegotiations held in July 1993 in Geneva, under the joint\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, with the support\nof OAU, have made it possible to involve the various parties\nto the conflict in constructive dialogue, the only way of\nfinding a lasting solution to this dreadful crisis.\nThe signing by the parties concerned of the Geneva\nAccord under the auspices of ECOWAS on 25 July 1993 at\nCotonou means, I hope, that conditions have now been\ncreated for a definitive return of peace and stability to this\ncountry and to the subregion. But let there be no mistake:\nto achieve lasting peace, the expansion of the ECOWAS\nMonitoring Group to include African troops from outside\nECOWAS, strengthened by the presence of international\nobservers, is one of the guarantees to bring about the process\nof assembling troops, disarming the belligerents and holding\ndemocratic elections in order to achieve a return to normal\nconstitutional life.\nThe Somali conflict is becoming ever more tragic. The\ninternational community must undertake joint, effective\naction. In order to achieve a rapid political solution, it is\nessential to halt the sudden escalations that are complicating\nthe situation in Somalia. The United Nations must resume\nits peaceful calling in the face of the many acts of violence\nthat are trying both the Blue Helmets and the Somali\npopulation.\nThe Security Council must decide on a new strategy if\nthe last obstacles in the way of pacification are to be\novercome and if the mission entrusted to the United Nations\nOperation in Somalia is to succeed. My Government calls\non all parties to the conflict in Somalia to make their\ncontribution to the success of the political process now under\nway towards the restoration of peace and security in fraternal\nSomalia.\nIn the Middle East, after a period of hatred, turbulence\nand hesitation, the parties to the conflict are moving\nprogressively towards lasting peace.\nThe signing on 13 September in Washington of the\nagreement on autonomy for Jericho and Gaza, marking the\nmutual recognition of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO) and Israel, resulted from the courage\nand political realism of the two parties. Guinea, as a\nmember of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable\nRights of the Palestinian People, welcomes this happy turn\nof events.\nFor my country peaceful coexistence between the State\nof Israel and the Palestinian State, under the leadership of\nthe PLO, must be a constant. After Jericho and Gaza, the\nliberation of all the other territories would then promote the\nconsolidation of relations between the two communities.\nThe march towards global peace in this very sensitive\nregion is to be encouraged and supported by assistance from\nthe international community, with a view to the socio-\neconomic development of the Palestinian State.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 35\nIn the Gulf, in order to prevent a new confrontation the\ninternational community must ensure that Kuwait and Iraq\nrespect the conclusions of the Boundary Demarcation\nCommission, which by Security Council resolution 833\n(1993) laid down definitively secure and inviolable borders\nbetween these two countries.\nThe relaxation of tension in Cambodia resulting from\nthe success of the elections is putting an end to the long\nyears of martyrdom endured by the Cambodian people.\nThere is reason to be happy over the positive results of the\nefforts by the international community in this area. Respect\nfor the Paris Agreements will be the guarantee of lasting\npeace and will facilitate the work of national reconstruction\nin that country.\nWith regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the scale of\norganized killings for irrational reasons, such as \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" and religion, and the prolongation of the conflict\nhighlight the divisions in this nation - which until recently\nwas strong and united - caused by the end of the cold war.\nAfter many efforts, the three communities involved in\nthe conflict have still not achieved a stable peace.\nUnfortunately, the law of the jungle continues to prevail in\nthe face of the impotence of some and the indifference of\nothers. There will be true security and lasting peace in\nBosnia and Herzegovina only after serious negotiations\nguaranteed by the international community in general and by\nthe States of the subregion in particular.\nWith regard to the Korean peninsula, the international\ncommunity must support the peaceful reunification of the\ntwo States there.\nAfrica, like other parts of the world, is at an important\nmoment in its history, a time of the democratization of its\nsociety and its institutions. The success of this process of\nqualitative change requires, none the less, taking into account\nthe historic, social and cultural realities of States in order to\ngenerate harmonious and lasting development.\nThe Republic of Guinea has taken important steps along\nthis road. Its achievements include ratification of the\nmajority of the African and international Conventions on\nhuman rights and humanitarian law; the adoption of the basic\nlaw in our country which calls for a presidential regime,\nseparation of powers, the primacy of law, political pluralism\nand decentralization; the establishment of a Supreme Court\nto ensure, among other matters, that there are no\nirregularities in balloting; the entry into operation of the\nNational Communication Council, whose job it is to ensure\nthe freedom of the press and free and equal access by all\npolitical parties to State communications media; and the\ndetermination of the Government to organize just and open\nelections. The presidential balloting will take place on\n5 December next, to be followed by elections to the\nlegislature.\nIn our view, these efforts at democratization in Guinea,\nas in most other African countries, should have increased\nsupport from development partners to guarantee their\nsuccess.\nThe convening of a series of international conferences\nin 1994 and 1995, particularly those regarding population,\nwomen and social development, confirm the interest of the\ninternational community in improving the economic and\nsocial situation of the most vulnerable sectors of our\npopulations. The same is true of their participation in\ndevelopment.\nThe year 1993 has seen the international community\ntake a more active interest in the emergence of an era of\npeace and universal respect for human rights.\nTwo conferences testify to that. Last June in Vienna,\nand more recently in Geneva, we gathered together to think,\nto evaluate what has been done, to consider prospects for the\nfuture, in order to eliminate the causes of suffering, and to\nreaffirm our faith in the dignity of the human being.\nNone the less, the absence of international machinery\nfor the prevention and punishment of serious violations of\nhuman rights makes any protection measures ineffective.\nMy Government therefore considers that the creation of a\npermanent international court with penal powers would be an\nimportant step in the protection and promotion of human\nrights.\nSuch a jurisdiction, by making inevitable the\npunishment of the perpetrators of such violations, would\nmake existing international law more effective.\nHowever, we must eliminate from international affairs\nany tendency to be selective with regard to human rights, in\nthe form of discrimination over which cases should be\ndenounced or over the sanctions that should be applied.\nMoreover, the existing link between human rights and\nother aspects of social development requires the elaboration\nof national programmes capable of promoting: protection of\nthe family, which is considered to be the basic unit of\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsociety; the integration of women into development and their\nparticipation in the management of public affairs; the\nprotection of vulnerable categories of people - children, the\naged and the handicapped - by establishing conditions\nfavourable to the development of their personalities; and\nefforts to combat the production, consumption and illicit\ntrafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances through\ninternational cooperation, harmonization of national\nlegislation and ratification of existing international\nConventions.\nAlong with these measures, effective strategies must be\nevolved to combat the pandemic of AIDS, which, because of\nits ravages, is a great scourge and a threat to mankind\u2019s\nsurvival.\nThe progress achieved in disarmament must be pursued\nin the hope that the resources thus released will contribute\nto the recovery of the world economy.\nIn his report on the work of the United Nations and in\nvarious communications the Secretary-General has described\nthe Organization\u2019s financial situation as being a matter of\ngreat concern. The situation is paradoxical. At a time when\nthe United Nations is entrusted with new tasks to be carried\nout in the service of peace and development the vital\nresources needed for those tasks are diminishing. We pay\ntribute to the Secretary-General and to encourage him in\napplying austerity measures and in restructuring to increase\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations system.\nMy delegation strongly urges Member States to honour\ntheir financial obligations by paying regularly and on time\ntheir assessed contributions in order to ensure the\nfunctioning of the United Nations and allow it to play its\nrole effectively.\nI hope that the message I have just delivered is one of\npersistence and hope. This message, based on the realities\nof the changes in the post-cold-war world and the divisions\nthose changes have caused in some parts of the world, urges\nthe Organization to implement new and dynamic strategies\nwith a view to establishing a new world order based on\nequality, justice, peace, cooperation and respect for\ndemocratic values.\nThis persistence demands sustained efforts to\ndemocratize international relations. The mode of operation\nand structure of some bodies in the United Nations system\nmust be revised; the decision-making bodies must be\nstreamlined and have an equitable representation of States\nand regions.\nThis persistence is the basis of our hope, a hope of\nmastering our collective future on the threshold of the\ntwenty-first century, a hope that all people will move\ntogether towards peace, the development of nations and the\npromotion of human rights. Our collective survival depends\non our solidarity and the effectiveness of our actions to\ntransform that hope into a reality in international relations.\n"

I should also like to pay a tribute to the\nSecretary-General and to his endeavours to promote the\nprinciples of the Charter and a stronger United Nations.\nFurthermore, I welcome the six new Members of the\nOrganization.\nThe totalitarian ideologies of this century have been\ndefeated, but the struggle of ideas is not over. Totalitarian\nideas and ideologies can take on different shapes at different\ntimes. In many places - and no country is immune - we still\nwitness expressions of racism, xenophobia and intolerance.\nIf these tendencies are not effectively countered today, the\nworld might have to face far uglier threats tomorrow.\nAs we welcome the progress towards peace and\nfreedom in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East and in South\nAfrica, we have to realize that these achievements will prove\nelusive if they do not give people a better life. Peace and\ndemocracy, freedom and reconciliation, must be cemented by\neconomic and social progress.\nThe individual\u2019s endeavours to improve his own lot and\nthat of his family reflect a basic human desire, which\ntranscends all cultural differences. If that desire is\nhampered, if hope turns into disillusion, a fertile ground is\ncreated for the merchants of hatred and preachers of\nviolence.\nThe regions of the world where security and prosperity\nhave been relatively well secured now have opportunities to\nhelp extend the zone of peace to areas that are struggling to\nescape the vicious circle of poverty and violence. The main\ninstruments for such developments are freer global trade and\na more open exchange of ideas.\nIn Europe, the evolving European union, of which\nSweden soon hopes to become a member, has a special\nresponsibility for ensuring that the Iron Curtain is not\nreinstalled in the form of persistent economic and social\ndivisions. The United States and Asia-Pacific countries are\nmeeting challenges of a similar nature in their regions. In\nthe Middle East and Africa, we all share a joint\nresponsibility.\nIn spite of all the challenges facing the world today -\nregional conflicts, widespread poverty, environmental\ndamage and arms proliferation - I believe we have a\nreasonable chance of extending the zone of peace and\nprosperity as we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury. In this effort we must be able to rely on a strong\nand efficient world Organization.\nToday the United Nations is reaching middle age. In\ntwo years it will be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary. The\nend of the cold war brings new opportunities to utilize the\nfull potential of the United Nations Charter and the United\nNations system. At the same time, a thorough diagnosis and\nsome strong prescriptions are necessary if the Organization\nis to serve as a vigorous instrument of the world community.\nFormer Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold once\nsaid:\n\\\"The United Nations is, and should be, a living,\nevolving, experimental institution. If it should ever\ncease to be so, it should be revolutionized or swept\naside for a new approach.\\\"\nThose words are as challenging and valid today as they were\nin the late 1950s.\nToday, I do not intend to dwell on those areas in which\nthe Organization works well, or to commend praiseworthy\ninitiatives. Instead, I would like to concentrate on areas\nwhere reforms and a special focus are indispensable. The\nmost important of these are the promotion of peace and\nsecurity, the role of the Organization in the economic and\nsocial fields, and the promotion of human rights.\nIn responding to several crises in the aftermath of the\ncold war, the Security Council has, de facto, considerably\nbroadened the concept of international peace and security.\nThe United Nations finds itself engaged on a regular basis\nin wide-ranging and diversified operations in a variety of\ncomplex conflict situations. Some of these are of an internal\nnature and many of them involve humanitarian efforts. The\nvery concept of United Nations peace-keeping has undergone\ndramatic change.\nUnprecedented demands are being placed on the\nOrganization in the quest for global security and peace.\nThere has been an eight-fold increase in the number of\npeople serving in peace-keeping operations during the past\ntwo years; the peace-keeping budget will more than double\nin the course of a single year.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe implementation of a peace agreement in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina will require additional and substantial\ncontributions from United Nations Member States. Again\nthe willingness and ability to provide personnel and\nresources will be tested. I am pleased to announce that at\nthis very moment a Nordic battalion group is being deployed\nin Bosnia.\nAs much as we welcome a peace settlement for Bosnia\nand Herzegovina we must recognize that it is far from an\nideal solution to that long and bitter conflict. It might\nconstitute no more than the beginning of a complicated and\nfrustrating process towards peace where all efforts must be\nused to counter the inherent dangers of continued aggression,\n\\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and the dismemberment of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina.\nAs soon as a settlement has been signed by the parties,\nwe should concentrate on building a peace which can\nprovide safe and decent conditions for the suffering\npopulation. First of all, we need a strong and efficient\npeace-keeping operation in order to assist in implementing\nthe provisions of the agreement.\nInternational organizations, particularly the United\nNations, must embark on a comprehensive reconstruction\nand rehabilitation programme. Special attention should be\npaid to the situation of refugees and displaced persons, and\nto their return, and to the plight of women and children.\nExperience gained from the conflict in former\nYugoslavia and from the successful United Nations\nTransitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) shows the\nneed for an integrated approach to international peace and\nsecurity. This must be one of the guiding principles for\nreforming and restructuring the Organization to enable it to\ndeal more effectively with today\u2019s conflicts. The\nSecretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" indicates\nways to improve the medium-term and long-term handling\nof peace-keeping. An interaction between preventive\ndiplomacy, peacemaking, peace-keeping and post-conflict\npeace-building is indispensable.\nThe need for reform in the peace-keeping area is\nundisputed. Ongoing efforts in this regard are commendable\nand should be further promoted. The Nordic countries\nintend to present proposals on this issue during the current\nGeneral Assembly session. At this early stage I would like\nto stress the following points.\nFirst, we should be able to react flexibly to dynamic\nsituations in peace-keeping operations, and that requires\nbetter provisions for planning and operations staff.\nCommand and control need to be clearly defined. The\noperative command of operations in the field would, of\ncourse, remain in the hands of the respective force\ncommanders.\nSecondly, close consultations between the troop\ncontributors, the Security Council and the Secretary-General\nare of special importance in complex peace-keeping\noperations. A forum for coordination and exchange of\ninformation to improve contacts between the Council and the\ntroop contributors would be desirable. I propose that such\na forum be set up for each major operation.\nThirdly, we urge Member States to respond positively\nto the Secretary-General\u2019s request, and provide troops, other\npersonnel and equipment on a stand-by basis for use at short\nnotice for peace-keeping purposes. The members of the\nSecurity Council hold a special responsibility to ensure that\nadequate resources are provided when it decides on new\noperations.\nFourthly, peace-keeping operations and humanitarian\nrelief efforts are increasingly interrelated, and this requires\nimproved coordination. In many cases the humanitarian\nefforts are vital for the successful pursuance of\npeace-keeping operations.\nFifthly, the great number of peace-keeping operations\nand their diversity require special emphasis on training. To\naddress the need for appropriate training of United Nations\npeace-keepers, United Nations training colleges should be\nestablished. The United Nations has an important role to\nplay in coordinating and promoting peace-keeping training\nfor all categories of personnel. Member States with\nlong-standing traditions in this field bear a special\nresponsibility. Sweden, for its part, is prepared to contribute\nto improving the skills of peace-keepers. This could include\ntraining for civilian and humanitarian-relief personnel, and\nalso for police and military staff.\nFinally, and most important, present and increasing\ndemands on United Nations peace-keeping cannot be met if\nMember States do not pay their dues. We must create the\nnecessary resources for the rapid implementation of Security\nCouncil decisions. If not, we run the risk of undermining\nthe credibility and the prestige of the United Nations and the\nSecurity Council.\nNew threats to regional security are emerging.\nCooperation between the United Nations and regional\narrangements is vital to meet these threats of global\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 19\nimportance. Regional action is indispensable to strengthen\nthe global community of values and to secure the efficient\nuse of scarce resources. In this spirit, the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is applying for\nObserver status in the General Assembly.\nAs Chairman of the CSCE Council, I signed in May a\nframework document with the Secretary-General. This\nframework aims at improving coordination and cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and the CSCE in conflict\nresolution in the CSCE area. The implementation of that\nframework is essential for realizing the goals of Chapter VIII\nof the Charter. Regular consultations, mutual exchange of\ninformation and coordination of activities between the United\nNations and the CSCE have started. CSCE missions are\nsupervising the implementation of United Nations sanctions\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and\nMontenegro). Concrete action in the field is also taking\nplace in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in\nunfortunate Georgia.\nAs Chairman of the CSCE I deplore the recent\ndevelopments in Georgia. The very survival of Georgia as\na member of the international community is now at stake.\nThe CSCE lends its full support to President Shevardnadze\u2019s\nefforts to prevent the dismemberment of his country. All\nparticipating States must now exert their influence to that\nend. The disintegration of Georgia is in no one\u2019s interest.\nThe Security Council bears primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, and\nmust be the driving force behind reforms in this area,\nreflecting the aspirations of the States Members of the\nOrganization. In this context, we welcome the statement by\nthe Council that progress in disarmament, arms control and\nnon-proliferation can make a crucial contribution to the\nmaintenance of peace and security. An early agreement on\na comprehensive test ban would enhance that concept.\nThe considerable increase in the number of Members of\nthe United Nations makes an enlargement of the Security\nCouncil a matter for urgent consideration. The effectiveness,\nefficiency and legitimacy of the Council must be the\noverriding goals. A reform must ensure that the Council\ncontinues to be relevant in a changing world and that it\nretains its capacity to act decisively and promptly.\nThe United Nations has a unique mandate to promote\neconomic, social and environmental progress and\ndevelopment. Increased attention should be given to these\nareas to overcome long-term threats to international peace\nand security. Today, the challenge for the United Nations is\nto fulfil its important role in supporting international\ncooperation and governments\u2019 efforts to master the\nincreasingly complex problems of development. Sweden is\nlooking forward to contributing to the deliberations on the\nreport of the Secretary-General on an agenda for\ndevelopment.\nAlong with other countries, we have witnessed with\nincreasing concern what seems to be a fragmentation and\nmarginalization of the United Nations in development\nassistance, not least in long-term development. It is obvious\nthat extensive reform is needed if the United Nations is to be\nable to respond to the new challenges.\nA more efficient governance structure and a broader,\nmore stable and predictable funding of operational activities\nare in the interest both of recipient and of donor countries.\nWe must sharpen our instruments, both in terms of policy\nformulation and development action, to avoid having interest,\ncommitment and funding from Sweden and other Member\nStates diverted to other organizations, to the detriment of\nthose most in need of what the United Nations could offer.\nAs a long-standing, major donor, with a firm belief in\nthe importance of the United Nations in the economic and\nsocial fields, Sweden will continue to work for much-needed\nreforms. Against this background, we hope that the recent\ndecision to continue negotiations on the role, size and\nfunctioning of the executive boards of the development\nprogrammes will lead to a result that ensures an effective\nconduct of work in the development field. The executive\nboards must be efficient instruments, capable of firmly\nguiding the work of their respective organizations.\nThe promotion of human rights is a United Nations\npriority objective, as set out in the Charter. Thus, the\nprotection and promotion of human rights should underpin\nthe whole spectrum of United Nations activities.\nFlagrant abuse of human rights and humanitarian law\nis still a tragic reality for millions of people in many parts\nof the world. At the World Conference on Human Rights,\nall States reaffirmed their solemn commitment to promote\nrespect for and protection of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms, the universal nature of which is beyond question.\nSuch commitments are, however, of no avail if they are not\nput into action. All States have a duty to adhere to the\ninternational conventions in this field.\nWe must also make sure that the United Nations human\nrights programme is allocated the means and support\nnecessary to fulfil its role. We should, as a matter of\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nurgency, take steps to increase the resources and improve the\nfunction of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights.\nThe establishment of a high commissioner for human\nrights would enhance the capacity of the international system\nto deal more directly with emergencies and grave violations.\nIt would help to improve coordination and integration of\nhuman rights within the United Nations system as a whole.\nThe commissioner would personify the priority given to the\nprotection of human rights, and this issue should be a matter\nfor prompt consideration by this General Assembly.\nSweden welcomes the fact that the General Assembly\nrecently proceeded to select the judges for the Tribunal\nestablished for prosecuting war crimes committed in former\nYugoslavia. This means that the Tribunal can shortly\ncommence its important work.\nLet me revert to the United Nations financial crisis. It\nis deeply disturbing that 90 per cent of the assessed\ncontributions are paid late or not at all. There is no\njustification for the failure of permanent members of the\nSecurity Council to live up to their obligations in this\nrespect.\nThe time has come to address the issue of incentives\nand penalties to enhance the principle of meeting financial\nobligations on time and in full. The recommendations of the\nIndependent Advisory Group on United Nations Financing\nin this respect must receive immediate attention. In this\nconnection, let us not forget the letter and the spirit of\nArticle 19 of the Charter, with its implications for the right\nto vote.\nAn adjustment of the scale of assessments must ensure\na fairer and more up-to-date application of the principle of\ncapacity to pay.\nAt a time of resource constraints, it is also imperative\nfor Member States to face the questions of priorities and\nefficient management. Strict budgetary discipline is\nrequired, and scarce resources should not be wasted on\nactivities lacking well-defined goals: the means entrusted to\nthe Organization must be used in the most cost-effective and\nprudent manner. We welcome the recent measures taken by\nthe Secretary-General in this regard.\nWe now have a unique opportunity to strengthen\ninternational cooperation. This window of opportunity is\ngreater than at any time since 1945. The judgement of\nhistory will be harsh if we fail to grasp this moment.\nTherefore, it is up to us, as politicians and statesmen of the\npresent generation, to make sure that international\ncooperation takes a decisive step forward.\nThe United Nations has a central role in this process.\nIf the United Nations concentrates on the essential tasks\nentrusted to it in the Charter, and manages to generate the\nnecessary support and cooperation, this can be achieved.\nThere is broad consensus among the Member States about\nthe need to strengthen the United Nations. If this consensus\ncan be transformed into rapid action, we will have made\nconsiderable progress in making the world Organization\nfulfil the high expectations attached to it today.\n"

        "file_text": " I should like at the\noutset to extend to you, Mr. President, my sincere\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election. I should like\nto wish you and the other members of the General\nCommittee success in the discharge of your important duties.\nI had a chance to congratulate the President of the Assembly\nat its last session when I saw him in Amman, and I should\nnow like to reiterate my gratitude for his competent\npresidency.\nThe cold war may be over, but its death-knell\nreverberates around the globe. The comforting ideological\ncertainties of super-Power confrontation are long gone.\nWhat have we to replace them? The new world order, with\nits promise of peace through collective security, has come\nupon a baptism of fire. And still it would appear that no\ncommon frame of reference, no new consensus, no global\nethic, has emerged.\nAs we enter the new millennium, we see the human\nspirit under siege as never before. Across the world, the\nvoices of millions cry out in desperation for relief, for\nguidance. If we, the peoples of the United Nations, are to\nbe true to our humanity, we must reappraise this situation\nthat is of our own making. We must learn its lessons, no\nmatter how hard, and we must apply them. It is our task\ntoday, and in the days to come, to fashion principles and\npractices for a truly new world order. In all fields of human\nendeavour, we need a new ethic for a new era.\nThe balance of world power politics has given way.\nEthnic nationalism has re-emerged, a phenomenon in which\nthe unifying bond of common citizenship is replaced by\nracial or religious exclusivity. As a consequence, we face a\nseries of apparently endless wars of attrition, fought to\nsecure the domination of one ethnic nationalism over\nanother. This trend must be reversed if our world is to be\nmade safe from the spreading contagion of conflict.\nMany over the years have thought it impossible, but the\nMiddle East is bucking this alarming trend. The signing on\n13 September of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of\nprinciples represents a significant step towards the\nachievement of a negotiated settlement in our troubled\nregion.\nOn the Jordanian-Israeli track, a common agenda,\nwhich has been carefully worked out over the last year and\na half, has now been adopted. We trust that this will signify\nthe commencement of serious and substantive negotiations\non the various elements of that agenda, with the aim of\nachieving just and mutually satisfactory solutions.\nThese developments are a triumph not only for the\npolitics of consensus, but also for the international morality\nwhich the United Nations advocates and the legality it\nupholds. Over the years the Assembly has passed resolution\nafter resolution calling for a just, comprehensive and lasting\nsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine\nquestion that lies at its core. Finally, the main actors are\nplaying the leading part in shaping their own destinies.\nMy country has always sought to bring this prolonged\nand bitter conflict to an end, and in our search for solutions\nwe have constantly aimed to reconcile peace and justice.\nJordan has advocated a negotiated settlement based on\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\nlonger than any other party. Under the new arrangements,\nall parties to the conflict are committed to the\nimplementation of those resolutions, affirming a cardinal\nprinciple of international law: the inadmissibility of the\nacquisition of territory by force.\nThere is an equally important principle to bear in mind,\nhowever. Peace cannot be piecemeal. It must be\ncomprehensive if it is to be viable. As foreseen in the\nMadrid framework for the peace talks, some issues cannot\nbe addressed by any two parties to the exclusion of others.\nThe questions of regional security, water and above all the\nrefugees cannot be resolved without direct reference to the\nneighbouring States. The status of Jerusalem has to be\ndetermined in a similar way. The legitimate rights which the\nthree great monotheistic faiths share in the Holy City must\nbe guaranteed and claims of political and administrative\nsovereignty accommodated to the satisfaction of all.\nIn view of Jordan\u2019s long association with the\nPalestinian question, the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO)-Israeli agreement will have major implications for our\nlegitimate interests. At a time when new entities are being\nformed, an orderly transfer of power and authority is vital.\nOnly this can safeguard the rights of existing States and\nthose of individuals. There are questions to address about\nState property, archives, debts, treaties, nationality, salaries,\npensions - the list is long, but not exhaustive. Jordan will\nseek modalities for their resolution with the relevant parties\nthrough our agenda.\nThe refugee question is of paramount importance. It\nshould not, and must not, be forgotten that the individuals\naffected have under international law a right of return and\ncompensation, and their host countries are likewise entitled\nto compensation. Jordan has shouldered an enormous human\nload as a result of the conflict. Three waves of involuntary\nmigrants - the refugees of 1948, the evacuees of 1967 and\nthe returnees of 1991 - have sought shelter and succor in\nJordan. Our treatment of these and other displaced persons\nhas been exemplary. We have provided them with education\nand health services, with jobs and welfare. Citizens of\nJordan, whether of Palestinian or Jordanian origin, enjoy\ncivil and human rights equally and participate as equals in\nour democratization process. Jordan seeks an equitable,\nsustainable international approach to the treatment of our\ndemographic burden, for it would be unconscionable to\npenalize host countries for their humanitarian policies.\nAnother crucial issue is water. Our agenda strikes a\ndelicate balance between the need for optimal utilization of\nscarce resources, on the one hand, and the equally\nimperative need to define the rights and duties of riparian\nStates, on the other. We also look forward to definitive\ndelineation of our borders with Israel, thereby giving\nconcrete expression to the right of every nation to live in\nsecure and internationally recognized boundaries.\nWhen the euphoria has subsided, these serious and\ncomplex questions will remain. The PLO-Israel accord,\nhistoric as it is, represents a first step towards Palestinian\nfinal status, which in turn will allow the Palestinians to take\npart in comprehensive regional security and cooperation\narrangements. For the Middle East cannot be reduced to a\nsingle issue. It more closely resembles a tapestry woven of\nnumerous intertwining threads.\nOne of these wider regional issues - the suffering of the\nIraqi people - demands urgently to be addressed. A\nsuccession of independent reports has brought to light the\nspecial impact of continued sanctions upon the most\nvulnerable segments of Iraqi society - in particular, the\nchildren. The sanctions regime that daily takes its toll on\nthe people of Iraq also has adverse consequences for\nneighbouring States, including Jordan and Turkey. Issues\nsuch as this must be resolved if the Middle East is to seize\nits chance for lasting peace. A cooperative security system\nwill help to protect the security of the States and peoples of\nthe region. We can only avert the kind of destabilizing\nconflict that followed the end of the cold war in Eurasia by\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 3\nmaking arrangements to ensure our common future,\nunderpinned by the full support of the international\ncommunity.\nDespite these outstanding questions, I have no doubt\nthat the extraordinary achievements of the autumn of 1993\nwill be seen in years to come as the start of a fresh course\nin the settlement of regional conflicts. The politics of\ndialogue and reconciliation have been our regional and\ndomestic priorities, for they are essential to the democratic\nprocess. We seek to extend the principles of consensus and\ncollective security to the Middle East to create a new\nregional order, an order which recognizes the right of each\nindividual to lead a life free from fear, want and despair, an\norder which will provide justice to all peoples and security\nto all States, an order in which the United Nations and its\nagencies can play a positive role not only in humanitarian\nintervention or the protection of human rights, but in active\npeace-keeping and peacemaking.\nJordan applauds Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali for\nhis valiant efforts to overhaul the United Nations structure\nand personnel, injecting a fresh sense of purpose\ncommensurate with the new challenges. It is in the interests\nof all Members of this body to see international law\nrespected and upheld. We must all assist the Secretary-\nGeneral in determining the criteria for United Nations\nintervention, whether in Lebanon, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia,\nAngola, Cambodia or anywhere else. The terms of reference\nembodied in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter must\nbe clearly defined, with checks and balances approved to\navoid the erosion of the independence and territorial\nsovereignty of Member States. There is also an urgent need\nfor well-trained international peace-keeping forces, which\ncould be established under a reconstituted Military Staff\nCommittee. The modus operandi for all United Nations\naction, irrespective of the issue at hand, must be the\nsupremacy of the rule of law and the uniformity of its\napplication. Double standards should not and must not be\npermitted, lest abuse of the law become the accepted norm.\nA wider issue concerning this Organization is that of\nSecurity Council reform. Jordan adds its voice to the host\nof countries that have called for a reassessment of the\nstructure of the Security Council. Clearly, conditions in the\nworld have changed dramatically since the formation of the\nCouncil, and we believe that these should be reflected in its\ncomposition. Jordan also lends its support to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s proposals for post-conflict peace-building outlined\nin his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nFor in every part of the world peace will remain\nillusory unless it touches the daily lives of ordinary people.\nPeace will not take root except in an environment conducive\nto regional cooperation and mutual security and committed\nto the welfare of individual human beings. The development\nof economic infrastructure and provisions for investment in\npublic services are as crucial as the questions of territorial\nsovereignty, national identity and security. It is for this\nreason that Jordan welcomes the recently convened\nconference to support Middle East peace as both timely and\npragmatic. The peace dividend in my region, as elsewhere,\nmust put an end to the politics of deprivation, fear and\ndespair, the breeding ground for political extremism and\nrejection.\nThe disparities and distortions created by half a century\nof conflict in the Middle East have given rise to such\nphenomena. That is undeniable. However, there is\nconsiderable alarm in the Muslim world at suggestions that\nIslam may replace communism as a global threat. These\nsuggestions are informed by a skewed perception of Islam as\na monolithic creed of violence, intolerance and oppression.\nIslam is not the new enemy. Extremism does exist\nwithin the Muslim world, much as it exists in the Christian\nworld, the Jewish world, the Hindu world and the secular\nworld. But to employ reductive stereotypes which demonize\none fifth of the world\u2019s population must ultimately be self-\ndefeating. It can only result in the breed of senseless\nviolence that has brought untold suffering and loss of life to\nBosnia. Rather than seeking an enemy at the gates, let us\neach in our own communities look inwards and address the\ndisparities and the despair that are the true causes of\nextremism and conflict. Let us join together to do battle\nwith the real enemy.\nThat enemy is a new world of \\\"each for himself\\\". That\nis what we must combat, with all the resources at our\ndisposal. For the politics and economics of exclusivity are\nthe bane of both pragmatism and idealism.\nIs the triple pillar of democracy, human rights and the\nfree market the ceiling of our ambition? Democracy and\nfree market economics are exceptionally successful systems\nwith noble objectives. But they are not ends in themselves.\nThe end for which we all strive is greater peace and greater\njustice for individual human beings across the world. How\nis this to be achieved?\nOne of our strongest defences against a new world of\n\\\"each for himself\\\" would be a new global business ethic,\napplying not only among the developed nations, but also\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nbetween those nations and the developing countries. Such\nan ethic might prescribe a relationship of partnership which\nwould in turn encourage greater self-reliance. Such an ethic\nwould be wholly reconcilable with human rights, with\npluralism, with care for the environment and with basic\nreligious values. I would like to suggest that the key to a\nnew ethic in all of these areas is our mutual interdependence.\nWhatever the context, injustice is perceived and conflict\nresults when the gap between \\\"self\\\" and \\\"other\\\" seems larger\nthan the common ground. This fundamental split between\n\\\"me\\\" and \\\"you\\\", between \\\"us\\\" and \\\"them\\\", is at the root of\nall oppositions, all polarities, all conflicts. Recognition of\nour mutual interdependence requires us to acknowledge the\nuniqueness of each individual and each culture - even into\nthe broader environment - and to learn to live with the\ndifferences as with the commonalities. It requires that we\nstrive for unity, but never seek to eradicate or compromise\ndiversity. It requires a new thinking based on tolerance and\ncompassion - a humane approach and respect for the voices\nof others. It requires, in short, that we be true to the ideals\nthat fired the founders of this Organization when they wrote\nthe words: \\\"We the peoples of the United Nations\\\".\nHerein lies the nexus between peacemaking, human\nrights, pluralism, cultural heritage and business ethics. Here\nlies the key to a new world of \\\"all for each other\\\", not \\\"each\nfor himself\\\".\nThe Middle East is showing the way. Its conflict, once\nheld to be the most intractable on Earth, is now on the path\nto reconciliation and healing. As we enter a new\nmillennium, a new era, let the world take heart from our\nexample. Let us emerge together from the past and together\nlet us build our brave new world.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his\nelection. I have no doubt that he will conduct our work in\na wise and balanced manner, in the same way as his\npredecessor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of\nBulgaria, Mr. Ganev.\nOnce again, we welcome the new Member States, the\nCzech Republic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra.\nWe also reiterate our gratitude to and support for the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who with clear\nobjectives and diplomatic efficiency has undertaken the new\ntasks of the United Nations in an international climate that\nis problematic but promising.\nSerious conflicts, such as that in the former Yugoslavia\nand the sensitive situation in Somalia, still remain, and are\nthe object of the work and efforts of the United Nations.\nThere are long-standing regional confrontations and frictions\nresulting from certain national, cultural or religious\nidentities; ignored for long periods, they are now demanding\ntheir rights, and not always in a peaceful manner.\nMoreover, there are still sharp economic imbalances\nbetween nations and regions, as well as the serious risk that\nthe Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) negotiations will fail because some\nGovernments insist on maintaining anachronistic protectionist\npolicies that adversely affect the trade opportunities of\ncountries such as Argentina.\nAbove and beyond these problems, this is also a time\nof hope and optimism; we are heartened by the expansion of\ndemocracy, the globalization of the concept of human rights,\nand the economic openness and reform in regions where\nstate control once prevailed and where today the basis for\nfreedom and the continual quest for peace is growing.\nPerhaps there is no better symbol of this hope and\noptimism than the historic agreement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization.\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict has until now been one of the\nmore disturbing issues in contemporary history and one of\nthe greatest obstacles to peace and stability. The\nconsequences of this prolonged and painful confrontation\nhave been felt everywhere; hence all humankind rejoices at\nthe agreements that have been reached.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 25\nThese agreements undoubtedly reflect the tenacious and\nintelligent diplomacy of the parties, the special contribution\nof Governments such as those of the United States, the\nRussian Federation and Norway and the support of the\nmembers of the Security Council; but, above all, they attest\nto the courage, intelligence and maturity of the peoples and\nleaders of Israel and Palestine. Today we wish to pay a\ntribute to all of them.\nSince its origin, the conflict in the Middle East has\nbeen of particular concern to Argentina, inter alia, because\nthe Arab and Jewish communities in our country have\nalways coexisted peacefully. That is why we have always\nhoped for peace and respected the need to avoid\nconfrontation and achieve a just and lasting solution taking\naccount of the interests of both parties.\nThe agreements reached can be considered as a\nbreakthrough in that direction. They open the door to a\nglobal settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and that is why\nwe rejoice at their attainment and firmly support them. We\ncall upon all States, particularly those which have interests\nor influence in the Middle East, to join resolutely in the\nsupport that the circumstances require.\nThe Republic of Argentina considers the maintenance\nof international peace and security as essential. Hence, my\nGovernment considers that the efficient functioning of the\nSecurity Council must be a priority for the Organization.\nArgentina has therefore clearly defined its position on\nan eventual restructuring of the Security Council. In our\nopinion, that body has recovered the role assigned to it by\nthe Charter. Any changes in its structure should therefore be\nmade solely on the basis of consensus, always respecting the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, and taking care\nnot to endanger its ability to fulfil effectively the\nresponsibilities assigned to it by the Charter. Hence we\nmust act with the utmost prudence, and on the basis of the\naforementioned principle, in making changes that would\nintroduce structural modifications, creating, for example, new\ncategories of privilege. In any case, it would be counter-\nproductive to ignore the position of those countries that have\nactively demonstrated their firm and continued support for\nthe Council\u2019s important work.\nMr. Bull (Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\nArgentina, for example, resolutely and actively supports\nthe system of collective security provided for in the Charter\nand the decisions of the Security Council. That support has\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated through concrete action in\naccordance with Council decisions, and in particular through\nour active presence in peace-keeping operations.\nAt present, Argentina is participating in nine\npeace-keeping operations; in the last few months alone, we\nhave pledged to send three new groups of our armed forces\nto Mozambique, Kuwait and Cyprus: a field hospital, a unit\nof engineers and an infantry battalion respectively.\nArgentina has the firm political determination to support\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, within its means.\nAt the same time, I am obliged to mention some issues that\ncurrently affect the normal development of the operations\nand that somehow limit the ability of Member States to\nparticipate to the extent they would desire.\nWe consider it a priority to do as much as possible in\norder to guarantee the safety of the men and women who\nparticipate in peace-keeping operations.\nThe arrears in the payment by Member States of their\ncontributions and the subsequent delays in reimbursements\nto troop-contributing Governments have created very serious\nfinancial problems for those Governments. For that reason -\nand also because of their own domestic budget limitations -\nthese countries find it ever more difficult to increase their\ncontributions of troops and equipment. A mechanism should\nbe established at once to find a solution. In this context, we\nwelcome the efforts of the office of the Secretary-General,\nas well as the initiative with respect to creating stand-by\nforces.\nThe priority goal of peace also imposes on us a firm\ncommitment to each State in the struggle against the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This\ncommitment is one of the main focuses of Argentine foreign\npolicy. Hence, we have brought total transparency to the\nArgentine nuclear programme. With that aim in view, we\nand Brazil have signed an agreement on full-scope\nsafeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency\n(IAEA); we have already ratified it. In the same spirit, we\nhave discontinued the missile project CONDOR II.\nIn addition, together with Brazil and Chile, we have\npromoted amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco that would\nstrengthen that major agreement and make it effective; we\nhope that these will soon be approved by the Argentine\nParliament.\nAt the same time, Argentina has been admitted to the\nMissile Technology Control Regime, whose guidelines we\nhave included in our domestic legislation, and is a member\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nof the so-called Australian Group. We are among the\noriginal signatories of the Convention on Chemical\nWeapons, and we participated actively in its drafting; we\nwill soon start the proceedings for its legislative approval.\nWe firmly support the negotiation, in the framework of\nthe Conference on Disarmament, of a treaty to ban all\nnuclear tests. The moratorium respected in practice by the\nnuclear Powers points to the existence of favourable\nconditions for the total ban of such tests.\nIn the field of armaments, we support the United\nNations Register of conventional weapons, to which we have\nrecently supplied all the relevant information and data. We\nare particularly interested in the functioning of the Register\nin our own region; last March, in Buenos Aires, we\norganized, jointly with the United Nations, a very successful\nregional seminar on this very important subject.\nLatin America is now going through a promising stage.\nThe climate of cooperation and harmony prevailing in the\nregion contributes to political stability and economic\ndevelopment. The expansion and consolidation of\ndemocracy and economic and social growth have also been\nstimulated as a result of the strong impetus given to the\nprocess of regional integration. As regards the Common\nMarket of the South (MERCOSUR), Argentina expresses the\nfirm political will and determination to contribute to its\nstrengthening. In this context we must acknowledge the\npositive role of the Rio Group, which has been consolidated\nas an increasingly useful and trustworthy mechanism for\ndialogue, cooperation and consultation.\nThe Group\u2019s information and internal communication\nsystems have been enhanced, which enables it to take unified\npositions on common problems. This has increased its\ninfluence in the United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS), where it has played a constructive\nand effective role, for example in relation to the crisis in\nHaiti.\nIndeed, Haiti is a case in which we note the opening of\na path towards democracy - albeit with certain difficulties.\nArgentina welcomes the agreement reached under the\nauspices of the United Nations and the OAS for the\nrestoration of democracy in that nation, through the\nsuccessful mediation of Mr. Dante Caputo, whose\nperformance is a source of legitimate pride for my country.\nProvided that the Haiti agreements are respected in their\nentirely, effective 30 October the Argentine Republic will\ncontribute, in the framework of relevant Security Council\nresolutions, a field hospital to be used in the operation the\nUnited Nations and the OAS will conduct together to support\nthe consolidation of democracy in that country.\nAs regards El Salvador, we note with satisfaction the\nsubstantive progress represented by the peace agreements\nrecently signed. We trust that the elections to be held next\nMarch will mark a decisive stage in efforts to consolidate\ndemocracy.\nWe also express our support for the re-establishment of\nconstitutional order in Guatemala and we encourage its\npeople and Government to continue their efforts to\nstrengthen democracy and the rule of law.\nThere has been remarkable progress in the consolidation\nof a climate of peace and d\u00e9tente in Latin America as a\nwhole, thanks to the restoration of democracy and to\neconomic reforms. There is still one case about which we\nare concerned and about which we have repeatedly\nexpressed our hope for profound change. The best option is\nto move forward in the same direction as the rest of the\ncontinent. Delays will only bring about more suffering for\nits people and more concern on the part of their Latin\nAmerican brothers.\nThe strengthening of a climate of harmony in Latin\nAmerica requires new ideas leading to the development of\na structure of regional security adapted to the present times\nand based on cooperation, balance and transparency. We\nbelieve that cooperative security is a realistic and feasible\nproposal for Latin America, and we urge the countries of the\nregion to give it special consideration.\nLatin America must enter fully into the new\ninternational context. In accordance with the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s ideas on the role of regional organizations as\nstated in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\", it should strengthen the\ncontribution of the Organization of American States to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\nArgentina shares with the rest of the international\ncommunity the constant anguish caused by the conflict\nunfolding in the former Yugoslavia and supports efforts\naimed at an urgent solution.\nWe are contributing significantly to the work of the\nUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), a force that\nhas helped save thousands of lives and has worked to\nprevent the intensification of conflict in the areas where it is\ndeployed.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 27\nWe support the resolutions of the Security Council on\nthis subject, and strongly condemn the practice of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" and other war crimes. Consequently, we support\nthe establishment of an international tribunal to try those\nallegedly responsible for violating international humanitarian\nlaw. We particularly condemn the inhuman attacks on the\ncivilian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and reaffirm\nthe need to reach an agreement acceptable to all parties\ninvolved, based on the principles of the London Conference.\nWe are deeply concerned particularly about the serious\nconsequences that civil and international armed conflicts\nhave on children. We urge the international community as\na whole to devote the utmost attention to this serious\nproblem and to initiate with the greatest urgency appropriate\nassistance plans to alleviate the suffering of children,\nespecially in situations like the one in Somalia or the former\nYugoslavia. This question - like those concerning the family -\nshould be given the greatest attention by organizations such\nas the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).\nWith respect to Cyprus, I reiterate our support for a\nprompt solution to the conflict, and we urge the parties to\naccept the plan developed by the Secretary-General\u2019s\nmission of good offices.\nI also reaffirm our express support for United Nations\nresolutions aimed at guaranteeing the territorial integrity of\nKuwait and peace and security in the region. We will\ncontinue to support the recently adopted Security Council\ndecisions that, in connection with this specific case, demand\nrespect for the inviolability of the international border - that\nhave already been defined - and the right of navigational\naccess.\nAs regards South Africa, we welcome, together with the\nrest of the international community, the recently adopted\nlegislative measures aimed at guaranteeing free and fair\nelections next April and establishing the Transitional\nExecutive Council. We continue to support the multiparty\nnegotiating process towards a democratic, united and non-\nracial South Africa. This is another of those world events\nthat are on the point of crystallizing in the next few months,\nand whose importance is really much greater than we could\nhave imagined even just a few months ago.\nI must mention once again the question of the Malvinas\nislands, just as we did a few weeks ago before the Special\nCommittee on decolonization. I reaffirm Argentina\u2019s\nwell-founded and unequivocal sovereign rights over those\nterritories and over the South Georgia and South Sandwich\nislands. The peaceful and negotiated recovery of the islands\nis a central and permanent issue in our foreign policy.\nThe United Nations Special Committee on\ndecolonization, at its recent session, adopted, for the first\ntime without a vote, a resolution on this question, in which\nthe parties are once again urged to start negotiations. We\ntherefore stand ready to do so.\nAs I informed the Special Committee, our relations with\nthe United Kingdom would be excellent but for the conflict\nin the South Atlantic, where apart from the central dispute\nthere are problems in specific areas. However, within this\noverall picture, there has also been progress in some of those\nareas.\nWe have made progress in reducing the security\nrestrictions inherited from the 1982 conflict and we have\nreached a provisional understanding on fishing for 1993.\nWe now have to negotiate a new agreement - which is being\nmade difficult because of certain recent unilateral British\njurisdictional decisions over the South Georgia and South\nSandwich islands - that must necessarily reflect Argentina\u2019s\nlegitimate decision now to relate its own catch to the actual\npotential of the area.\nAs regards oil, there is still an impasse, both because of\nthe rejection of a specific proposal for cooperation put\nforward by Argentina and because of the United Kingdom\u2019s\npreference for acting unilaterally. We are still convinced\nthat there is no realistic alternative to cooperation. We are\nsure that potential investors will also see it that way, because\ntheir situation would be highly uncertain and unstable in any\nother context.\nArgentina\u2019s relationship with the islanders is an area in\nwhich there have been important developments in the last\nfew months.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, there\nhave been communications between the inhabitants of the\nislands and Argentina. I personally have been in touch\nseveral times with some of them. My Government reiterates\nits conviction that it is in everybody\u2019s interest to establish\nnormal relations between the islands and the continent. We\nreaffirm that Argentina and the United Kingdom are the only\nparties to the dispute, but we underline also our willingness\nto conduct a dialogue with the inhabitants of the territory\nbecause they deserve our consideration and respect. We are\nalso aware of the weight their opinion carries in London.\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe dialogue with the islanders has wide support in my\ncountry, and is a natural development in the civilized search\nfor a solution to the conflict. It is important that the\nislanders themselves also understand that this is an inevitable\nstep, because the only realistic alternative is to march\nforward together.\nThe recent World Conference in Vienna ratified the\nuniversal and binding nature of respect for human rights.\nToday it is no longer possible to claim, as despotic\ngovernments have in the past, that the treatment States afford\ntheir citizens is exclusively an internal affair.\nIt is a fact that the principle of absolute sovereignty has\nbecome relative and that the international community, acting\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, has laid the\nlegal foundations for denouncing violations of human rights\nwherever they occur and for implementing specific measures\nto ensure that human rights can be exercised to the full. We\ntherefore support the establishment of the post of High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\nFurthermore, in the opinion of the Argentine\nGovernment, there must be universal and complete freedom\nof the press, because this is a fundamental guarantee of\nrespect for other essential human rights. Whatever excesses\nthere may be in the exercise of press freedom are nothing\ncompared with the awful drawbacks of policies that restrict\nthat freedom.\nArgentina supports the restructuring of the United\nNations economic and social system in order to increase its\neffectiveness and global credibility in that area.\nIn the field of the environment and development, we\ncontinue to give high priority to the implementation of\nAgenda 21 and the Conventions on climatic change and\nbiodiversity and to the use of the global environment facility\nas a financial mechanism for implementing environmental\nprojects in the those and the related areas of marine\npollution and the ozone layer.\nArgentina will participate actively in the International\nConference on Population and Development to be held in\n1994. We support the negotiating process now under way\nand we agree with the conceptual framework agreed upon\nfor the programme of action in that field.\nWe shall also participate actively in the World Summit\nfor Social Development, and we stress the great importance\nof the negotiating process and of what is included in the\nSummit\u2019s agenda.\nI should like to refer to the deterioration in the\nOrganization\u2019s financial situation, which is so seriously\naffecting its regular activities and is endangering the normal\nfunctioning of peace-keeping operations.\nReality tells us that the only way to solve the problem\nis the timely payment in full of the financial obligations of\nMember States. Such payment is a fundamental factor in\nrestoring the financial soundness of the United Nations, but\nit is undoubtedly not the only one. We consider that it is\nindispensable for immediate steps to be taken to make the\nallocation and use of the Organization\u2019s scarce resources\nmore efficient, thus avoiding administrative disorder and\npossible irregularities or substandard management practices.\nA proper balance between budgetary control and the\nimplementation of activities will enable us to achieve the\nfinancial consolidation needed to fulfil the goals set out in\nthe Charter.\nIn conclusion, we wish to reiterate our firm conviction\nthat, despite the serious problems that still obtain, we are\nwitnessing an encouraging development in the principles that\nin their time guided the founding fathers of the United\nNations.\nThose ideals of universal peace today seem more within\nour grasp and in that context the Argentine Republic, a\ndemocratic and peace-loving nation, is genuinely willing to\ncontribute to strengthening an international system based on\nlaw and justice, and guaranteed by the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, your\nunanimous election as President augurs well for the forty-\neighth session of the General Assembly. I extend my\nheartiest congratulations to you and best wishes for success.\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General, has\ngiven a new vision and a new impetus to the United Nations\nat a crucial time in its history. We wish him well in his\nefforts.\nMy Government is deeply touched by the sympathy and\ncompassion expressed by the leaders of several delegations\non the devastating earthquake in India on\n30 September 1993, and, with your permission,\nMr. President, I shall have to go back to India immediately.\nThe United Nations will soon be 50 years old. It has\nhad many achievements to its credit: decolonization; efforts\nto alleviate poverty; peace-keeping; disarmament; devising\nan accepted code of international law; respect for human\nrights and concern for the environment. I would like to\nreiterate India\u2019s faith in and consistent support for the United\nNations and its efforts to establish peace and the well-being\nof peoples. We take note that the United Nations is trying\nto evolve so as to better serve the principles and purposes of\nthe Charter. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to\nmake what he has called a transition from the old to the new\nUnited Nations, which would be particularly useful and\nfruitful for the less developed and less fortunate States.\nThe euphoria generated by the end of the cold war has\nin the past two years given way to concerns about the\ndifficulties of achieving a new global equilibrium and\nstability. Essentially, we can see these difficulties arising\nfrom the contradictory pulls and pressures exerted by the\nforces of positive integration and harmony on the one hand\nand fragmentation and discord on the other.\nThe end of the divisions of the cold war and the efforts\nto halt and reverse the arms race have generated some of the\nintegrative forces. Some forces of integration have also been\nat work in the global economy, which has been characterized\nby the globalization and interdependence of countries\u2019\nfactors of production and of issues of trade, money, finance,\ntechnology, environment, population and development. The\ndesire of the developing countries to participate more\nactively in the growth of the world economy and the\nbuilding-up of free-market, liberalized economies for\nthemselves adds another positive dimension. Issues of\ncommon concern and global survival - economic\ndevelopment and regeneration, environmental sustainability,\ndemographic management, technological dynamism and\nhealth for all - have provided a sense of common destiny.\nThe communications revolution has resulted in greater\ncultural intermingling and openness around the world.\nThese forces of integration are, unfortunately, opposed\nby those of fragmentation. Represented by sectarian and\nsubnational aggression, racism, religious fundamentalism,\nbigotry, terrorism, drug trafficking and arms smuggling, they\npose a threat to peace, global security, democracy, human\nrights and economic and social development. We are also\nwitnessing strife, conflicts and cruel, unceasing and irrational\ncivil wars in many parts of the world. Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Somalia and Afghanistan cause us anxiety and\nconcern. The proliferation of such local conflicts and the\never-increasing flow of refugees across national frontiers re-\naffirm the truism that peace, like freedom, is indivisible and\nthat the disruption of peace anywhere is a danger to peace\neverywhere.\nThese divisive forces have caused not only political\ninstability but also economic collapse in several instances.\nConversely, economic sluggishness and lack of development\nin several cases have led to political upheavals. Inward-\nlooking, exclusivist and narrowly self-centred global\neconomic policy-making has been in evidence at a time\nwhen the global economy is overshadowed by recession and\nlack of dynamism. Macroeconomic coordination is at its\nweakest. Protectionist tendencies are strong. The potential\nof developing countries to act as vigorous engines of growth\nfor revitalizing the world economy stands largely ignored.\nIn developing countries, absolute and deepening poverty,\nhunger and malnutrition, disease, illiteracy and the lack of\nshelter and sanitation for a large portion of the population\nhave caused political and social tensions. The structural\nimbalances and flaws of the post-Second-World-War\ninternational economic order persist and prevent the\nmaximization of the benefits of interdependence and\nglobalization.\nAgainst this backdrop, the task of the United Nations\nshould be to construct a new global equilibrium by fostering\npositive integrative forces and discouraging, if not\ncounteracting, the forces of fragmentation and discord. For\nthis, the new United Nations will have to reiterate the\nfundamental and immutable principles on which it was built:\nrespect for the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nsovereign equality of nation States. I am glad that the\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSecretary-General stated in his report to the forty-eighth\nsession:\n\\\"National sovereignty is the art of rendering\nunequal power equal. Without State sovereignty, the\nvery instrument of international cooperation might be\ndestroyed and international organization might itself\nbecome impossible.\\\" (A/48/1, para. 16)\nThe United Nations will have to set an example for the\nconduct of relations amongst nation States on the basis of\nrespect for the rule of law, democracy and pluralism. Any\ninternational framework, whether it be associated with peace\nor development, must be transparent and must deal with\nissues of global concerns on a non-selective and non--\ndiscriminatory basis.\nIn the final analysis, the institutions, concepts and\nagencies that represent the new world order will be judged\nby their ability to harness and channel the beneficial and\ncreative forces of integration for the benefit of peace and\ndevelopment for all and by the ability of the United Nations\nto ensure that the interests of its weaker Member States are\nfully reflected therein. In these still perilous times, they\nwould have to promote development cooperation and\neffectively arrest the plunge into insecurity, strife and chaos,\nparticularly when these threaten the very foundation of\nMember States, where ultimately the United Nations is\nrooted.\nThere have been references in this Assembly to all\nthese conflicts, big or small, local or with international\ndimensions, describing them in the generic terms of ethnic,\nreligious and civil wars. The plurality and complexity of our\npost-cold-war world do not permit such generic labelling.\nNor are these conflicts amenable to generic and instant\nremedies. A number of instances of strife or aberrations are\npart of the historical legacies inherited by Member States.\nEach is posited in a different socio-economic and cultural\nmatrix of causation; each is caught up in a different cycle of\ncircumstance and violence. The imposition of peace through\nunilateral external intervention will only perpetuate situations\nembodying the Orwellian logic of \\\"peace is war\\\" that we see\nin many parts of the world today.\nWisdom lies in overcoming conflict situations with a\npositive vision animated by peace and amity and in creating\nthe necessary confidence and will for peace among countries\nand peoples. It is in this spirit that India is ready to initiate\na dialogue with Pakistan to build mutual confidence and to\npromote a climate of stability in our region. I can only hope\nthat Pakistan will respond to this, and have a dialogue with\nus, instead of trying to go around the world accentuating\ndifferences that will be difficult to resolve later.\nWe welcome the recently concluded peace accord\nbetween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO), and earnestly hope that this will be a true harbinger\nof further positive developments aimed at establishing lasting\npeace and prosperity in West Asia. We also welcome the\nannouncement by Mr. Nelson Mandela that irreversible\nprogress towards a non-racial, democratic South Africa has\nbeen made. In response to his suggestion, India, which had\nimposed trade sanctions against South Africa as early as\n1946, has initiated action to lift those sanctions and to\nnormalize relations with South Africa.\nWe trust that the recognition by the Security Council of\nthe international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait will\ncontribute to the stabilization of the situation in the Gulf\nregion. We hope that the faithful implementation of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions will lead to the\nalleviation of the present difficulties of the peoples of the\nregion.\nIn Somalia, a whole population has gone through a\nprotracted civil war and famine with hardly any\ngovernmental machinery to tackle the situation. This made\nit imperative for the United Nations to act. As an\nunprecedented humanitarian mission, the multilateral action\nin Somalia enjoyed the support of the entire world, including\nthe factional Somali leaders themselves. India, for its part,\nhas contributed one of the largest contingents to this mission.\nNow that the situation has improved and starvation has been\naverted, the United Nations operation faces new problems.\nIt is necessary for the United Nations to reassure all sectors\nof the people of Somalia about its role in the country,\nintensify the process of political reconciliation and adhere\nstrictly to the original objectives of the mission.\nThe phenomenal increase in peace-keeping operations\nin the post-cold-war period and their inclusion as an element\nof the new agenda for peace is at once a matter of comfort\nand concern. It is a matter of comfort because the United\nNations at long last has started playing its Charter role in the\narea of peace and security. In the altered international\npolitical environment, we would like the United Nations to\nrealize its full potential. At the same time, the involvement\nof the United Nations on an unprecedented scale with peace-\nkeeping operations causes us concern because operationally\nthe United Nations is not fully prepared and equipped to\ndischarge this role effectively. And, legally and\nconceptually, the limits, procedures and rules of the\ninvolvement of the United Nations are not clearly defined.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 13\nFor peace-keeping operations to be successful, it is\nnecessary to follow certain guidelines and criteria. All\navenues of pacific settlement of disputes, as laid down in\nChapter VI of the Charter, should be fully explored and\nexhausted before resorting to peace-keeping operations under\nChapter VII. Decisions on such operations should be taken\nin a democratic and broad-based manner, and after thorough\nconsideration of all aspects. To command universal\nendorsement and maintain their non-partisan character,\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations must be based on\nthe consent of all the States parties to a dispute. They\nshould be undertaken with a specific mandate and a clear\ntime-frame. Greater efficiency should be achieved in both\nplanning and execution of peace-keeping operations. The\nForeign Minister of the Russian Federation, in his address to\nthe General Assembly a few days ago, put forward a few\nproposals in this respect which merit consideration by the\nGeneral Assembly. The concept of invoking humanitarian\nrelief as a basis for peace-keeping operations may have to be\napproached with a great deal of caution and circumspection.\nAny new United Nations operation for providing\nhumanitarian relief must be completely non-partisan - in fact\nand in the perception of the parties involved.\nThat consideration must also guide any discussion or\ndecision on preventive deployment. The United Nations\nmust not allow itself to be burdened indefinitely with\nobsolete and ineffective peace-keeping operations. Every\npossible measure should be taken to ensure the safety of\npeace-keeping personnel.\nAnother aspect of the agenda for peace which we\nwould like to underline is the particular importance we\nattach to Article 50, which enjoins the Security Council to\nfind solutions to the special economic problems faced by\nthird States on account of the implementation of sanctions\nimposed by the Security Council. We call for an automatic\nmechanism that would put remedial action in place\nsimultaneously with the imposition of sanctions.\nAn integral element of any agenda for peace in our\ntime is the achievement of disarmament, particularly nuclear\ndisarmament. Having endorsed the Chemical Weapons\nConvention, the United Nations should move on to consider\nsimilar steps in other areas of disarmament.\nWe welcome the unilateral decision of the United States\nto extend its moratorium on nuclear testing until the end\nof 1994. The focus of the nuclear-weapon Powers should\nnow be on the early conclusion of a universal, verifiable and\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty leading to the\nelimination of all nuclear weapons.\nIndia\u2019s commitment to non-proliferation is complete\nand unequivocal. India has an unblemished track record.\nIndia\u2019s proposal made in 1988 for an action plan for nuclear\ndisarmament within a specific time-frame is of continuing\nrelevance in our bid to rid the world of the global scourge\nof nuclear weapons. We believe that a new, just and\nuniformly applicable regime for non-proliferation which does\nnot discriminate between the nuclear-weapon and the\nnon-nuclear-weapon States should be considered at an early\ndate. Such a treaty should place equal obligations on all\nStates. For a non-proliferation regime to be truly\nmeaningful, it must also address the questions of a\nconvention on the non-use of nuclear weapons, a verifiable\nfreeze on the production of fissionable material, a total ban\non nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general and\ncomplete disarmament. The global spread and reach of\nnuclear weapons reduce to a travesty the objective of\nachieving genuine peace and security within a narrow\nregional framework. It is our hope that the United Nations\nwill take firm action in this direction to achieve this in the\nsense I have mentioned.\nOne area of concern for developing countries is the\nquestion of ad hoc and unilateral export controls and other\nrestrictions being placed on the transfer of dual-use and high\ntechnology with the ostensible purpose of curbing\nproliferation. Non-proliferation concerns must not be made\na pretext for denying developing countries access to\ntechnologies critical for their development. There is,\ntherefore, need to evolve multilateral, non-discriminatory and\ntransparent arrangements to regulate the transfer of such\ntechnologies so that peaceful uses and dissemination of some\nkey technologies are not denied to the developing world.\nThere is perhaps merit in convening a special session\non disarmament to examine the whole gamut of\ndisarmament-related issues that arise in the new context of\ntoday. The question of a peace dividend arising from\ndisarmament in the form of financial and technical resources\nfor the enhancement of international development\ncooperation in the context of the United Nations could be\none of the issues that special session could address.\nIt is obvious that there can be no global security unless\ndevelopment is ensured, and we therefore attach as much\nimportance to an agenda for development as to the \\\"Agenda\nfor Peace\\\". Agenda 21 of the Rio Declaration, outlining the\nplan and programme for global cooperation in ensuring\nsustainable development; the outcome of the Final Act of the\neighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD VIII), on the partnership for\ndevelopment between the North and the South; and the\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nforthcoming Conference on Population and Development, as\nwell as the World Summit on Social Development, provide\nthe international community enough opportunity to promote\neconomic and social development and environmental\nsustainability, particularly in developing countries. The work\non an agenda for development should build on all these\ndevelopment-related action programmes and provide a new\nimpetus to development cooperation, both under United\nNations auspices and in bilateral and other multilateral\ncontexts. Enhancement of the role, resources and\ncapabilities of the organs and agencies dealing with\ndevelopment in the United Nations system should be\nstressed. The United Nations should also be enabled to have\na more interactive relationship with the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions in a spirit of finding considered and innovative\nsolutions to global economic problems and pooling all\navailable resources for that purpose.\nComprehensive and constructive dialogue between the\nNorth and the South and the strengthening of a global\npartnership for development are the needs of our times if we\nare to avoid the replacement of the East-West divide by a\nNorth-South one. India has always participated in the\nongoing North-South dialogue through the Group of 77 and\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and in keeping with the\nrequirements of a more focused dialogue. India has become\npart of the new group of 15 developing countries for\nSouth-South consultation and cooperation, the G-15. We are\nacting as host to the fourth summit meeting of that group at\nNew Delhi in December. Representing the developing\ncountries, we have had a promising start through an informal\ndialogue with the G-7 and we hope to build on those\nbeginnings in a spirit of \\\"global partnership for global\nbenefit\\\", as was stated by my Prime Minister,\nMr. P. V. Narasimha Rao in his message to the\nG-7 Chairman.\nSome key issues where there is an ongoing dialogue but\nwhich none the less need further consideration and\nimplementation include: participation of developing\ncountries in global macroeconomic coordination and\ndecision-making; reciprocation by the North of the efforts of\nthe South at restructuring and economic liberalization\nthrough the pursuit of expansionist policies conducive to\nlong-term growth and opening them up to global competition\nin goods, services and manpower through reduction and\nelimination of protectionist barriers; increased capital flows,\nboth official and private, bilateral and multilateral, to\ndeveloping countries to offset the crippling effects of the\ndebt burden and to accelerate growth and development; and\na balanced, successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round,\nwhich should ensure substantial enhancement of market\naccess for developing-country exports and of their access to\nthe tool of competitiveness.\nThe profoundly humanistic traditions of the Indian\ncivilization, with its emphasis on tolerance, harmony,\nnon-violence and the inviolability of the individual, have\nfound their modern expression in the setting up of a\ndemocratic, secular and egalitarian polity and society in free\nIndia.\nBeing the largest practising democracy and effecting a\nsynthesis between a multiplicity of ethnic, religious and\nlinguistic groups and peoples has been no easy task, as some\nin the West are themselves realizing even in the context of\ntheir relatively lesser diversities. The Constitution of free\nIndia consolidated this humanistic tradition and is indeed a\nveritable bill of human rights. A strong and independent\njudiciary and a totally free press have also been watchdogs\nof democracy and human rights in India.\nIndia\u2019s commitment to the effective protection of\nhuman rights has now received another institutional impetus\nwith the establishment of a National Human Rights\nCommission comprised of a retired Chief Justice of the\nSupreme Court of India, a retired judge of the Supreme\nCourt of India, a former Chief Justice of the State High\nCourt and other eminent persons as well as the chairmen of\nthe three separate national commissions which already exist\nto protect the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled\ntribes, women and minorities. The Commission has been\nmandated to inquire into allegations of violations of human\nrights and has been invested with wide-ranging powers,\nincluding the power to establish special investigation teams\nto carry out effective investigations. The findings of the\nCommission are to be published from time to time besides\nbeing reflected in its annual report, which will also be laid\nbefore Parliament. The law also provides for the\nestablishment of human rights commissions by the State\nGovernments, on the pattern of the national Commission, as\nalso special courts for the speedy trial of cases involving\nhuman rights violations.\nI am confident that members of the Assembly will\naccept that India has established the most appropriate human\nrights commission to ensure that there will be full human\nrights protection in the country.\nOur commitment to universally acceptable\nnon-discriminatory norms of human rights and their\nprotection and promotion cannot be questioned. It was in\nthat spirit that we participated actively in the World\nConference on Human Rights, which recognized the\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 15\nimportance of this issue. We are however pained that not\nenough emphasis is put on a major threat and impediment to\nthe realization of human rights, namely, terrorism, especially\nthe kind that is aided and abetted by one State against\nanother. Why is it that a few so-called human rights\nadvocates and Member States of the United Nations choose\nto focus on the human rights of terrorists - those who\nindulge in senseless murder, destruction, pillage, the\ndisruption of civilized existence and the undermining of\ndemocratic institutions? Why do they virtually turn a blind\neye to the violation of the human rights of the victims of\nsuch terrorism - innocent civilians or those upholding law\nand order and the territorial integrity of States? Can they in\ntrue conscience allow terrorists and their supporters to usurp\nthe moral high ground on human rights?\nThe United Nations will have to take strong action\nagainst terrorists because terrorists engage in all kinds of\nviolence. They try to upset democratically taken decisions\nin a country by using force and killing people. This must be\ntotally condemned by the United Nations and stopped\ncompletely so that people can live in peace and in\ndemocracy and express their views in accordance with the\nconstitution of their country.\nIn sum, we believe that international cooperation in the\nprotection of human rights can succeed only if it is within\nthe framework of respect for the sovereignty and integrity of\nStates and of a vigorous global programme for anti-terrorist\naction. We would, however, like to point out that any\nunilateral use of human rights as an instrument of political\npressure or intervention, or as an obstacle to trade or a\ncondition for development cooperation and aid, in fact serves\nthe opposite purpose and impedes the full realization of the\nhuman rights of people of affected countries.\nThe enhanced role of the United Nations in\ninternational affairs calls for the restructuring and redefining\nof the functions of its principal organs.\nThe responsibilities of the Security Council have grown\ndramatically in the past few years, requiring a greater degree\nof participation by the overall membership of the United\nNations in the Council\u2019s decision-making process. We must\nrecognize that the membership of the United Nations has\ngrown enormously over the years. A more balanced and\nexpanded representation for Member States in the Council is\ntherefore inevitable. Unity of purpose among its members\nrather than size determines the efficiency of any\norganization. The expansion should not be done selectively\nor in a piecemeal manner. The principles or criteria of\nexpansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership\nshould be agreed upon by consensus. For the selection of\nadditional States in an expanded Council, the population -\nwhich represents the principle of democracy and an element\nof power - the size of the economy and the future potential\nof the countries concerned should be taken into account,\nalong with equitable geographical distribution and the\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. There is virtual unanimity among those who have\nresponded to the Secretary-General that an expansion of the\nCouncil is imperative. Interesting suggestions have been put\nforward by several countries. The logical next step would\nbe to start a process of consultations to arrive at a suitable\nand fair formula that commands universal support.\nThe permanent members should be responsive to the\naspirations of developing countries represented in the\nGeneral Assembly on the basis of equality. It is therefore\nessential also to revive the role of the General Assembly, as\nwas originally envisaged in the Charter.\nWe stand on a decisive threshold incomparable to any\nin history, a moment in time when we must bring to bear a\nlarger vision and foster the forces of positive integration,\ndemocracy and cooperation at national and international\nlevels.\nMy Prime Minister has, in characterizing the 1990s as\nwatershed years in global affairs in the realm of political,\neconomic and environmental challenges and changes,\nconveyed an unequivocal message:\n\\\"We cannot go wrong if we make coexistence\nand peace our watchword, and common universal\ngood our objective\\\".\nIt is my Government\u2019s belief that this quest for the common\ngood, jointly undertaken, will be central to the success of\nour endeavour and for the achievement of the Charter\u2019s\nobjective of harmonizing the actions of nations in the\nattainment of these common ends.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, Sir, on behalf of\nthe Government and people of Barbados, to express our\nprofound appreciation of the high honour which the\ninternational community has done to our region by your\nunanimous election to the presidency of the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. As I join all those who\nhave offered you congratulations from this rostrum, I feel\nbound to note with pride the considerable diplomatic skill,\nexperience and commitment which you bring to the Chair\nand which allow my delegation the confidence to anticipate\na most successful and satisfactory session.\nMay I also commend your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan\nGanev, for having safely guided us through the demanding\ndeliberations of the forty-seventh session.\nWe particularly thank the Secretary-General for his\nvaliant efforts to secure international peace and security.\nBarbados welcomes Andorra, Eritrea, the Czech\nRepublic, Monaco, Macedonia and Slovakia to membership\nof this great Organization, which we are sure will benefit\nfrom their participation.\nIt augurs well for the outcome of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly that it has started against a backdrop of\nsome success - however tenuous - in Haiti, in South Africa\nand in the Middle East. The cases of the Middle East and\nSouth Africa, especially, represent triumphs of diplomacy\nand patient negotiation. In this regard, no praise is too high\nfor Norway\u2019s outstanding contribution in guiding seemingly\nintractable enemies along the difficult and daring path\ntowards peace. As we in Barbados laud such a remarkable\nachievement, we hope fervently that it will lead soon to the\nlong-sought goals of an Israel within secure boundaries and\na homeland for the Palestinian people, goals envisaged in\nSecurity\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We dare to\nhope, too, that that reality, once achieved, will lead to a\nlasting peace in the region.\nIn South Africa, despite the carefully orchestrated\ncampaign of violence and terrorism aimed at subverting\nevery effort to create a non-racial, democratic South Africa,\nPresident de Klerk African National Congress President,\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNelson Mandela have, with truly remarkable courage and\nforesight, brought their country to the point where the\ntransition to democracy has now been enshrined in the laws\nof South Africa. Barbados rejoices that a date has been\nfixed for the holding of universal elections, and we welcome\nthe establishment of the Transitional Executive Council to\nprepare for those elections.\nIn praising those two leaders, we must not overlook the\nsignificant contributions of the President of the Pan-\nAfricanist Congress, Mr. Clarence Makwetu, and the many\npatriots on all sides, present and past, who have made and\ncontinue to make their various contributions, sometimes even\nto the extent of the supreme sacrifice. The encouraging\nprogress in South Africa demands and deserves, no less than\nthe process in the Middle East, the wholehearted support of\nthe international community.\nThe issue of Haiti is a matter of extreme importance to\nthe peace and security of the people of the Caribbean. You\nare well aware, Sir, that the Heads of Government of the\nCaribbean Community were long convinced that the\nunfortunate and unacceptable state of affairs resulting from\nthe overthrow of the elected President of Haiti could be\nresolved only through the intervention of the Security\nCouncil, the valiant efforts of the Organization of American\nStates notwithstanding.\nThe fact that the Governors Island Agreement was\nsigned so soon after the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 841 (1993) would seem to justify our consistent\nposition. Today we continue to be apprehensive over the\nlevel and nature of the widespread turmoil in Port-au-Prince,\nturmoil which seems designed to delay, if not derail, the\nreturn of President Aristide to his rightful place. The\ninternational community in general, and the Security Council\nin particular, must not sit idly by, merely expressing regret\nat the sorry state of affairs in that unhappy country. The\nSecurity Council - indeed, all of our countries - must be\nprepared to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that\nthe murders and assassinations cease. All parties must be\nmade to honour the Governors Island Agreement and the\nresults of the 1991 elections.\nThere is another issue which the people of the\nCaribbean have contemplated with more or less trepidation\nduring the past 34 years. And although none of them might\nhave an immediate solution to offer, many believe that\nnothing would bring more joy to the people of the region\nthan the announcement of an impending rapprochement\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and our great neighbour to the\nnorth. In the light of recent international events, Barbados\nrefuses to believe that only between these two countries can\nno path to a peaceful resolution of their conflict be found.\nFour years ago in Barbados we celebrated the 350th\nanniversary of parliamentary practice. And it is in that\ncontext that we applaud the United Nations for its role in the\nconduct of successful elections in Angola and Cambodia.\nWhile we are pleased at the post-election progress being\nmade in Cambodia, we are concerned about the deterioration\nin Angola. We urge the international community to be more\nvigilant in monitoring events in Angola. The comity of\nnations has a duty to ensure that the results of free and fair\nelections are accepted and respected by all parties - in Haiti,\nin Angola, in Cambodia or wherever else there is\ninvolvement by the United Nations in any such process. No\nparty anywhere should ever be allowed even to think that the\ninternational community would tolerate the frustration of\nproperly conducted election exercises.\nBarbados remains convinced that the international\ncommunity must adopt an integrated approach to peace, an\napproach which concentrates on building and preserving\npeace rather than on mere peace-keeping. Barbados\ntherefore appreciates the attention currently being paid by\nthis Organization to international security and peace-keeping.\nIndeed, we welcome the recent adoption of General\nAssembly resolution 47/120, endorsing the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". We recognize that, in the\nsearch for consensus, the interests of all parties have not\nbeen fully addressed, but we consider that the reforms\nrecommended represent a useful first step towards the\nenhanced role the United Nations is called upon to play in\nthe promotion of international peace and security.\nInternational peace and security can hardly be attained\nif the global environment continues to be sullied by rampant\nhuman rights abuses. Barbados welcomes the advances\ncontained in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of\nAction of the World Conference on Human Rights,\nparticularly the re-emphasis of the universality of human\nrights and the right to development as a human right.\nHowever, we must here reiterate that the widespread\nresurgence of racism, xenophobia, religious intolerance,\nethnic conflicts and various other forms of human rights\nabuses pose a most serious threat to the peace and security\nof all of us.\nThe proposal to create a post of high commissioner for\nhuman rights was such a contentious issue at the World\nConference for Human Rights that it has been referred to\nthis session for action. Barbados considers that before such\na post is established the following considerations should be\ntaken into account. First, the mandate of the high\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 11\ncommissioner should be satisfactorily defined. Secondly,\nthere should be adequate safeguards to ensure the\ncommissioner\u2019s independence and neutrality. Thirdly, the\noffice of the high commissioner should not be manipulated\nto achieve the political ends of any State. Fourthly, the high\ncommissioner should be empowered to investigate alleged\nhuman rights abuses across all borders, and not on a\nselective basis.\nBarbados believes that preventive measures taken to\nguarantee international peace and security must also include\nefforts to safeguard basic social and economic rights.\nHowever, we are equally convinced that not enough is being\ndone to address development problems. We concur in the\nSecretary-General\u2019s view that respect for human rights, the\nrule of law and democracy cannot survive outside a\nframework of adequate development. Where access to food,\nclothing, shelter, education, health and the opportunity for\ngainful employment is denied, democracy cannot flourish.\nIn spite of 50 years of unprecedented technological\nprogress, in many parts of the world abject poverty still\npersists. An estimated 1.1 billion persons, or one-fifth of\nhumankind, are unable to afford even minimally acceptable\nlevels of food and shelter. This problem, though\nconcentrated largely within the developing world, has\ntranscended national boundaries and now affects persons in\nthe developing and developed countries alike. Low\ncommodity prices, lack of investment capital, the inability to\nsecure access to world markets, and high unemployment and\nlow productivity have contributed to the marginalization of\nmillions of unfortunate persons.\nParticularly hard hit are our young people, among\nwhom disillusionment and despair have already begun to\ntake their toll, driving a growing number of them to resort\nto various forms of anti-social behaviour, including drug\ntrafficking and drug abuse. This desperate situation will not\ndisappear because of speeches denouncing poverty, or the\nadoption of resolutions calling for its elimination. Rather,\nwe must urgently adopt radical measures designed to attack\nand eliminate the conditions which fuel the growing and\nunacceptable levels of poverty in our societies.\nBarbados considers that social development will be\namong the greatest challenges facing the United Nations in\nthe twenty-first century. We therefore regard the\nconvocation of the World Summit on Social Development,\nscheduled for Copenhagen in 1995, as a clear signal that\nsocial development has become a priority issue on the world\nagenda. Barbados believes that that Summit will provide the\ninternational community with an opportunity to direct\nattention to the acute problems relating to development. Our\nconviction is that the focus of the development debate must\nbe shifted to human development and that bold initiatives\nmust be taken to combat poverty and to lighten the burden\nwhich structural adjustment places on the most vulnerable in\nour societies - our women and our children.\nBarbados is heartened by the Secretary-General\u2019s\n\\\"agenda for development\\\" proposal and looks forward with\ninterest to reviewing the report requested in General\nAssembly resolution 47/181. We also welcome the timely\ninitiative taken by the Government of Papua New Guinea, an\ninitiative in which I understand you yourself, Mr. President,\nhave no small interest. My delegation hopes that this matter\nwill be given the serious and urgent consideration it merits.\nAmong the deterrents to development, drug trafficking\nremains one source of grave concern to the Governments of\nthe Caribbean. Apart from the tragic consequences that drug\naddiction has for the health of our people, illegal drugs\nconstitute the single most pervasive ingredient of increased\ncrime in our societies. In Barbados, for example, the\nmajority of criminal cases brought before the courts involve\ndirectly or indirectly some linkage to drugs. Penal and\nhealth systems are being stretched to their limits, while the\nfinancial implications of enforcement and rehabilitation are\nstaggering. Not even developed countries have yet been able\nto eradicate from their societies drug abuse and its\nmirror-image, drug trafficking. Developing countries are\nstill further disadvantaged by their chronic inability to take\non the powerful drug cartels and the narco-terrorists with\nany hope of real success. The problem is transnational in\nscope.\nIt is therefore imperative that the Global Programme of\nAction adopted at the 1990 special session on drugs be\nimplemented as soon as possible and that cooperation at the\nbilateral, regional and multilateral levels be enhanced. The\nrole of the United Nations Drug Control Programme is vital\nto this process. Barbados looks forward to the four\nhigh-level special plenary meetings scheduled to take place\nduring this session. We expect that further measures to\ncombat the universal scourge of drug abuse will emerge,\nalong with the provision of the adequate funding necessary\nto achieve these ends.\nIt has been a year now since the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development was convened\nin Rio de Janeiro. Since that time, other matters - primarily\nmatters of peace and security - have helped to push\nenvironment and development issues out of the limelight.\nThe meeting of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, charged with the responsibility of monitoring\nthe implementation of Agenda 21, served to remind us that\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsustainable development must continue to receive serious\nattention from the international community. The\nCommission succeeded in generating the necessary political\nwill to impart a powerful impetus to national action for the\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We can ill afford any loss in\nmomentum.\nThis brings me to the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,\nwhich the Government of Barbados has offered to host. The\nConference will take place in Barbados from 25 April to 6\nMay 1994. The Government and people of Barbados are\nhonoured that the international community has, in accepting\nour offer, placed its confidence in our capacity to host\nsuccessfully a conference of this size and importance. The\nConference will be the first of the follow-up activities of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (UNCED) to be completed. It presents an\nearly opportunity for the implementation of the commitments\nreached at the Rio Earth Summit. As such, the Conference\nalso represents a test of the political will of the international\ncommunity to match the solemn commitments of Agenda 21\nwith real action towards more sustainable development.\nMy colleague the Minister of the Environment, Housing\nand Lands of Barbados recently briefed the Preparatory\nCommittee of the Global Conference on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States on the\nprogress of preparations for the Conference. My delegation\nwill submit details on further progress when the item comes\nup for discussion in the substantive Committee. However,\nlet me at this stage put on record my Government\u2019s\nappreciation of the spirit and atmosphere which prevailed in\nthe Preparatory Committee. Unfortunately, the meeting of\nthe Preparatory Committee fell victim to the emergency\nconference-servicing measures announced by the\nSecretary-General on 26 August 1993 and for that and other\nreasons the preparatory process did not go as far as it might\nhave. Barbados shares the view, expressed by many\ndelegations attending the meeting of the Preparatory\nCommittee, that it would be dangerous to leave finalization\nof the preparatory process until April 1994 in Barbados.\nGiven the number and complexity of the issues left\noutstanding from the Preparatory Committee, Barbados is\nconvinced that some arrangements must be put in place to\ncontinue the preparatory process. We therefore look forward\nto working with interested delegations towards reaching\nagreement on an appropriate mechanism for continuing the\npreparatory process prior to the commencement of the\nConference.\nThe Barbados Conference will provide the basis for the\nbuilding of a partnership for the implementation of the\ndecisions taken at Rio. The international community will be\nafforded the opportunity to signal its commitment to move\nforward towards more sustainable patterns of development\nin a pragmatic, realistic manner, based on practical,\nachievable goals. The people of Barbados look forward\neagerly to welcoming representatives of each and every\nMember State in April 1994.\nThe threat of natural disasters to the sustained\ndevelopment of small developing countries must not be\nunderestimated. Barbados applauds the efforts of all those\nassociated with the International Decade for Natural Disaster\nReduction, to lessen the vulnerability of those communities\nmost susceptible to such disasters. We consider it essential\nthat response capabilities in this area be improved with all\ndeliberate speed.\nBarbados is collaborating closely with the Caribbean\nDisaster Preparedness Agency, the Caribbean Regional\nSystem, and with the Pan American Health\nOrganization/World Health Organization to continue to\nimprove its capacity to bounce back from the effects of a\ngrade five-hurricane or to be able to come to the aid of any\nof our Caribbean neighbours who may fall victim to any\nnatural disasters. I am happy to be able to report that across\nour region we have succeeded to some degree, at great\nexpenditure of effort and resources, in improving our\ncapability to mitigate the effects of natural disasters.\nBarbados supports wholeheartedly the current initiative\nof the United Nations to fashion a safer environment for all.\nThe Organization is now called upon to expand its activities\nover wide areas of the globe. The new freedom of action\nreflects the current geopolitical reality. A new configuration\nof power is taking shape. While it is too early to determine\nthe outcome we must seek to mould this new phenomenon\ninto an instrument for the preservation of peace and security\nand for the alleviation of human suffering everywhere.\nThe Secretary-General has not missed an opportunity in\nrecent times to highlight the dichotomy with which he is\nfaced. He continues to point out that additional mandates\nare being heaped upon the Organization as a result of the\nnew climate without a corresponding willingness to provide\nadequate resources for their execution. Barbados strongly\nsupports the expressions of concern by the Secretary-\nGeneral. We urge all Member States to do the best they can\nto correct this unsatisfactory situation. It is clear that there\nare some States whose capacity to pay may temporarily\noutstrip their actual ability to pay, but it is unconscionable\nfor those who can pay not to do so. I trust, Mr. President,\nthat under your expert guidance the General Assembly will\nfinally be able to take appropriate measures to address the\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13\nfinancial crisis threatening the very existence of the\nOrganization.\nBarbados accepts that the Security Council must always\nbe allowed to function without unnecessary hindrance. We\nrecognize equally clearly the principle of accountability.\nThe Council has served its purpose well in the past, but\nchanging times and circumstances dictate the need for an\nenhanced participation.\nTwenty-seven years ago as a member of my country\u2019s\nfirst delegation, I sat in this Hall and listened to the then\nPrime Minister, the Right Honourable Errol Barrow, deliver\nhis inaugural address to the Assembly at its twenty-first\nsession.\nIn the intervening years though much has changed\nmuch has remained the same. Small countries like mine still\nbelong to the submerged two thirds of the world\u2019s\npopulation, and where we manage by our own painful efforts\nto raise our living standards we are faced with the prospect\nof graduation. To be faced with graduation on the one hand\nand structural adjustment on the other is to be caught\nbetween Scylla and Charybdis. Once again Barbados would\nurge with all the power at its command that the constant\nthreat of graduation be lifted from the vulnerable economies\nof small, developing countries.\nIn looking back over those 27 years with their ups and\ndowns, their triumphs and disappointments, through\nprosperity and adversity, graduation and structural\nadjustment, as Mr. Barrow was on that day, I too am\nreminded of John Bunyan\u2019s Mr. Valiant For Truth when he\nsaid:\n\\\"Tho with great difficulty I am got hither,\nYet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have\nbeen at to arrive where I am.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "I deem it a special pleasure\nand honour to extend my cordial congratulations to the\nPresident on his election to preside over the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I also wish to express\nmy high esteem for the excellent way in which the former\nPresident, Mr. Ganev, presided over the proceedings of the\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly.\nMay I hail the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and in particular for his dynamic\nrole and valuable personal contribution.\nThe Albanian delegation takes this opportunity to greet\nthe six newest Member States. In particular, we welcome\nthe presence here of our neighbour, the Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, whose stability, territorial integrity\nand international recognition are of great importance for\nstability in the Balkans.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly we have\nseen many important events. We have witnessed the\nendeavours of peoples for progress, prosperity, harmony and\nunderstanding, peace and cooperation, as well as for\nsurvival. The end of the cold war paved the way for the\nattainment of the peoples\u2019 denied aspirations to\nself-determination and national identity, democracy and\nequality. It brought their national and spiritual assets closer\nto each other and enhanced their endeavours to occupy their\nrightful place in the list of civilized nations of the world.\nBut these endeavours were also accompanied by crises\nand conflicts, which have grown and are now among our\nmost serious challenges. We hail with the greatest pleasure\ntoday the impressive progress made by Israel and the PLO,\nas manifested in the historic agreement to put an end to\nyears and years of hostility. This remarkable achievement\nis the best proof that if willingness is shown by all parties,\na suitable and acceptable solution can always be found. This\nis the right moment to recall the worthy contribution made\nby the major actors in world diplomacy to this end and\nexpress our conviction that with such a commitment they\nwill continue to deal with other similar crucial questions.\nAt last year\u2019s session of the General Assembly the\nAlbanian delegation had the pleasure to declare in this Hall\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe victory of the democratic forces and their commitment\nto Albania\u2019s reintegration into the community of democratic\nand civilized nations. Today, from the same rostrum, I have\nthe honour and the obligation to state that my country\u2019s\ndemocratic transformation has been successful, embracing all\nfields and spheres of human activity. This transformation\nhas once and for all determined the direction in which\nAlbanian society will go, and it is forging ahead fast. After\nmore than a year of such government, Albania has taken big\nsteps in the setting up of qualitatively new political and\nsocial structures and institutions, as well as in the\nobservation and legal guarantee of the rights and freedoms\nof individuals.\nWe can truly speak now of an overall democratic\nrestructuring of Albanian society. Our goal is to consolidate\nthe constitutional democratic political order by setting up\ndemocratic institutions with a view to taking action on\nvarious political subjects and non-governmental organizations\nwith a view to guaranteeing participation by all citizens in\nthe running of the country. Albania is being led by people\npossessed of new aspirations, ideologies and ideas. The\nGovernment and its programme enjoy general approval,\nwhich ensures political stability at home.\nMaking headway in Albania along with general\ndemocratic reform is economic reform, aimed at a total\nrestructuring of a closed and inefficient economy on the path\nto a free and open market economy. This restructuring is\ndifficult and truly painful, given the conditions of a country\nthat had known no reform or any kind of cooperation. The\neconomic recession the world is experiencing today has a\nconsiderable bearing on the outcome of reform in Albania.\nFurthermore, the strict implementation of United Nations\nsanctions, and the considerable economic losses consequent\nupon it, have influenced the rhythm of Albania\u2019s economic\nrecovery. To be successful, Albanian economic policy also\ncounts on assistance and cooperation through programmes of\nsuch important world economic institutions as the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the\nEuropean Community, and on specific programmes of aid\nand cooperation with member countries of that Community\nand a number of other States. Albania has surpassed the\nstage of emergency aid and is working intensively to carry\nout capital-producing projects, in which an important role is\nalso played by United Nations agencies such as the United\nNations Development Programme and the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund. In spite of the fact that the Government\nhas been in power for only a short time, positive results are\nevident.\nApplication of a strict monetary policy has reduced\ninflation from a monthly rate of 15 per cent in 1992 to 0.9\nper cent in March 1993. Since August of last year, the\nAlbanian currency has shown a fairly fixed exchange rate in\nrelation to hard currencies, and the budgetary deficit has\nbeen reduced significantly. As result of the massive\nprivatization of agricultural land, production has increased by\n25 per cent.\nIt is only natural that at this time Albania has to cope\nnot only with the difficulties of transition and world\neconomic recession, but with those caused by the long war\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina and other complex political\ndevelopments in the region, which negatively affect our\nefforts to restore our ruined economy and hinder the\npromotion of the democratic process not only in Albania but\nin the entire Balkan region. We consider the creation of a\ndemocratic space and a climate of peace, security and\nstability in the former Yugoslavia and all over the Balkans\nto be factors of decisive importance for the future of this\nregion, which has been overburdened with so many conflicts.\nWe are resolved to contribute constructively to the\nestablishment of such a democratic space of peace,\nunderstanding and cooperation among the Balkan countries.\nThe priority of Albanian foreign policy is the creation\nof favourable conditions for the democratic transformation\nand total revival of the country. We see the solution of all\nour problems precisely in the creation of this democratic\nspace in the Balkans and the full incorporation of this region\nin the European process of integration. In this context,\nAlbania\u2019s permanent political goal remains step-by-step and\noverall integration in Europe by encouraging parallel\ncooperation with the European collective economic, political\nand security forums and structures. Reliable guarantees of\naccelerated integration are advanced democratic legislation\nworked out in compliance with European standards and the\ninstitutional restructuring of State administration and local\ngovernment, along with total privatization of the economy\nand the general encouragement of local and foreign private\ninitiative and activity in Albania. Reference should also be\nmade at this point to direct assistance from an important\nforum of European democracy, the Council of Europe.\nAlbania regards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nas an institution of effective vitality, which is indispensable\nto organized concrete inter-State cooperation towards a real\ncollective security system in Europe and the entire\nEuro-Atlantic area. Our relations with this important\npolitical and military organization for security in Europe are\nintended to constantly enhance cooperation towards full\nintegration in its structures. In close cooperation with other\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 45\nEuro-Atlantic institutions, the Conference on Security and\nCo-operation in Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation\nCouncil also have a very important role to play in\nsafeguarding peace, not only through confidence-building\nmeasures and increased understanding among the\nparticipating states, but also in the prevention of conflicts\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes. We are confident\nthat only a common security policy is conducive to a climate\nof mutual confidence, capable of coping with new\nchallenges. Through the position we have expressed at these\nforums, Albania has proved that it consistently abides by this\nassessment.\nThe protection and observance of human rights, one of\nthe fundamental issues of the new world democratic order\ntoday, are closely linked with stable development,\ndemocratic transformation, political stability and international\nsecurity, especially of the underdeveloped and turbulent\nregions of the world. Human rights are indissolubly\ninterwoven with the aspirations of mankind to well-being\nand socio-economic and political progress, freedom and\ndemocracy. It is imperative for all members of the\ninternational community at present to commit themselves,\naccording to their respective domestic conditions, to joint\nefforts to translate these aspirations into reality for the sake\nof a civilized and advanced world. The Albanian people,\nwho will never forget the high price paid during half a\ncentury of brutal dictatorship, attaches a high value to human\nrights and political and civil freedoms. In compliance with\nthis assessment, our Government considers support for\ndemocracy and human rights to be the guide of its political\norientation. It is determined to build a modern State and a\ncivilized society, based on respect for the human rights of all\nstrata of the population without exception or discrimination.\nAlbania has adhered to two basic United Nations pacts on\nhuman rights and is making preparations to adhere to a\nseries of other conventions. Not long ago, for the first time\nin the history of the country, the Albanian Parliament\nendorsed the Constitutional Law on Fundamental Rights and\nFreedoms, thereby testifying to our determination to put\nhuman rights at the forefront of the stable foundations of the\nnew Albanian democratic society we are building.\nWe consider respect for minority rights to be an\nimportant and indivisible aspect of human rights. Albania\u2019s\npolicy in this field rests on the principles of full equality and\nnon-discrimination, the creation of a broad democratic space\nso that persons belonging to national minorities can assert\ntheir own national identity, and the creation of a climate of\nexemplary trust and coexistence. Minorities are an integral\npart of the political, social and economic life of Albania; as\nprotagonists of the democratic development and\ntransformation of the country, they have access to real\nrepresentation in all socio-political structures, at State and\nlocal levels of administration. Their situation in economic\nand social domains will improve hand in hand with that of\nthe rest of the population.\nThe end of the cold war freed mankind from the fear of\nglobal confrontation, even though peace and security are still\nseriously threatened by a number of regional conflicts. In\nsome regions of the world, the actions and practices of some\nStates where totalitarian and ultranationalist regimes are in\npower run counter to the aspirations and endeavours of the\npeace-loving international community. More than 30 armed\nconflicts, accompanied by savage crimes and great suffering\nfor the civilian population, are currently ablaze in various\nregions of the world. These conflicts, which are a flagrant\nviolation of human rights and which are attended by all the\ninevitable consequences, have seriously shocked mankind.\nThe conflict in the former Yugoslavia, especially in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which is the bloodiest and most\ndangerous conflict known in Europe since the Second World\nWar, has not yet found a stable solution. The monstrous\nmassacres carried out against the innocent civilian\npopulation, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" - that barbaric form of\ngenocide - and all the other inhuman acts associated with\nthis conflict have once more testified to the fact that it is\nimpossible to reform totalitarian and ultra-nationalist\nsocieties. This conflict is a challenge to civilized Europe, to\nthe conscience and humanitarian sentiments and passions of\nthe whole of peace-loving mankind. That is why a firm\ncollective answer from mankind is required. We have seen\nthat the imposition of sanctions, despite the effect on the\nSerbian economy, was not the only or the most effective\nmeans to put an end to the war and restore peace. This is\nbecause the practical commitment of some countries did not\nmatch their verbal statements in support of the sanctions.\nThat is why sanctions failed to paralyse and seriously\ndamage the Serbian war machine. Time has proved that the\nsanctions needed to be accompanied by other, simultaneous,\nmeasures of pressure.\nWe think that a convincing example should be set for\neverybody, demonstrating that the reaction and the stand of\nthe United Nations will always be the same in cases of\naggression. It is the Organization\u2019s duty to use all means at\nits disposal to implement the principles of the Charter, to\nmake peace, and to fulfil the hopes of mankind.\nBut we understand that the United Nations sanctions, as\nthe only means based on the world community\u2019s consensus,\nwill continue to be applied, putting the necessary pressure on\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe Belgrade authorities until a final solution of the whole\nYugoslav crisis is found, including an overall improvement\nof the situation in Kosovo.\nThe Yugoslav crisis is multidimensional and\ncomplicated because of many interlacing factors and\ninterests. It is evident that its most tragic and bloodiest\nmanifestation is the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwhich for more than a year has been the centre of the\nattention and the efforts of public opinion and of the\ndiplomacy of the major Powers of the world. I would like\nto stress that my country has condemned the Serbian\naggression, and has hailed and unreservedly supported all the\nendeavours of the international community to establish peace\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Republic of Albania will\nsupport any solution to the Bosnian conflict which is based\non a free and fair agreement. Solutions which legalize\nterritorial annexation and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" at the expense\nof other peoples such as the Muslim population in Bosnia\ncan hardly be heralds of peace.\nMoreover, we would like to remind this important\ninternational forum that the other aspects of the Yugoslav\ncrisis should not be neglected either, for these could have\nconsequences of tragic proportions not only within the\nformer Yugoslavia but also in the Balkans and beyond.\nIn that light, I would like to point out that the Albanian\nfactor in the former Yugoslavia, especially the Kosovo issue,\nis of a crucial importance to finding an equitable and lasting\nsolution to the crisis. Therefore, we insist that this problem\nhas to be properly addressed. If, in assessing this factor,\nthere is insistence on the rigid position that Kosovo is an\nintegral part of Serbia, that it is annexed to Serbia and that\nthe Albanian people in the former Yugoslavia are a minority,\nthen nothing will be achieved, but the idea of creating a\n\\\"Greater Serbia\\\" will be reconfirmed and legalized at the\nexpense of other peoples.\nWe think that the breakup of the former Yugoslavia -\nwhich was also the cause of what is now called the\nYugoslav crisis - puts the issue of succession in the former\nYugoslav federation in an entirely new light: it brings up\nthe question of considering the peoples\u2019 right of\nself-determination, and the expression of their free will as to\ntheir political status. If this means war, as some people\nthink, then it is up to the United Nations and the Security\nCouncil to intervene and guarantee respect for the principles\nof the Charter. We firmly maintain that no forcible change\nof borders or territorial gains through aggression and \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\" will be recognized.\nThe choice is clear: if we want people to believe in the\nnew world order, we must create all the legitimate\ninternational conditions needed to realize and defend their\naspirations, by setting up an entirely new type of system of\nUnited Nations protection for defenceless countries and\npeoples.\nAs to the national question of the Albanians, we see its\nsolution in the creation in the former Yugoslavia and all\nover the Balkans of a broad democratic space that would\nallow freedom of communication and freedom of movement\namong the more than 7 million Albanians who live, in\nterritorial continuity, in that space. We are against territorial\nfragmentation and division, and the hermetic sealing of a\nsingle people within the borders of neighbouring countries.\nI believe that I am also expressing the opinion of many\ncountries represented here when I say that the outbreak of a\nconflict in Kosovo would be the start of a great tragedy.\nAlbania expresses its profound gratitude to the international\ncommunity for all the efforts it has made to prevent a\nspillover of the conflict to Kosovo and to support the denied\nrights of the Albanian people there. I also express my\ngratitude to the United Nations, which has clearly warned\nthat any warlike act by Serbia in Kosovo will pose a threat\nto international peace and security. We highly appreciate\nthis support and call for a serious commitment by the\ninternational community to take all the necessary urgent\nmeasures to prevent the Bosnian tragedy from recurring in\nKosovo.\nAlbania has long made it clear that placing Kosovo\nunder the control and protection of the United Nations is the\nonly guaranteed way of preventing conflict and discouraging\nthe silent \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" that Serbia is practising there.\nIt would also create a favourable climate for dialogue\nbetween the legitimate Albanian representatives of Kosovo\nand the Serbian authorities on the political status of the\nprovince and on any other issue linked with the question of\nsuccession to the former Yugoslavia.\nTherefore, we reiterate our stand that only the United\nNations, and primarily the Security Council, should\nexpeditiously take the necessary measures to prevent conflict\nin that region.\nAt a time when the concept of using peace-keeping\nforces prior to a conflict has been consolidated in theory and\nhas been put into practice, preventive deployment is fully\njustified in the case of Kosovo, because of the threat that the\noutbreak of an intra-Balkan armed conflict would pose to\ninternational peace and security.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 47\nWe are profoundly concerned about the issue of\nKosovo and the grave situation created there since the\nelimination of its autonomy in 1989 and its complete\nannexation and subjection to Serbian military and police\nauthority, and we call for proper attention to the fact that a\npeaceful settlement of the Yugoslav crisis should cover the\nentire space of the former Yugoslavia and all its aspects and\nproblems. Any partial settlement without the necessary\ninternational safeguards would be unstable and would not do\naway with the germs of new conflicts.\nTo sum up, I would like to reiterate that the Republic\nof Albania sees in the United Nations an organization\ncapable of implementing the principles of its Charter and\ncoping with all the challenges that result from the dynamic\ndevelopments of our time, especially serious problems in the\nfields of security, disarmament, sustainable socio-economic\ndevelopment, environment and so on.\nWe see the United Nations also as the primary\ninstitution responsible for the collective safeguarding of\npeace and security in the new era. Albania will render\nunreserved support to all initiatives aimed at enhancing the\nefficiency of this universal Organization."

        "file_text": "I am delighted and honoured to\nhave this opportunity once more to address this distinguished\ngathering.\nI bring with me from the Kingdom of Swaziland the\ngreetings and good wishes of Her Majesty Indlovukazi and\nthe whole Swazi nation to our fellow Members and friends.\nBefore I begin my remarks, I should like, on behalf of\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, to express my deep condolences\nto the people of India, who have suffered so much in the last\n24 hours. Our thoughts and prayers reach out to the families\nand friends of the victims of the tragic earthquake as they\nstruggle to overcome the effects of disaster. May Almighty\nGod protect all in the region from further suffering.\nMr. President, on behalf of the Swaziland delegation,\nlet me offer my sincere congratulations on your election to\nthe presidency of this forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Many issues of vital importance to the world\nwill be discussed during this session, and we are entirely\nconfident in your ability to lead us to a successful conclusion\nin all our deliberations.\nWe should also like to express our deep appreciation to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who guided the\nproceedings of the forty-seventh session to such great effect.\nWe are meeting at a time when our Organization is\nfaced with a number of concerns, whose challenge to our\nresources, and to our unity, is perhaps without parallel in the\n48 years of our existence.\nWe Members are fortunate that our success in meeting\nthese challenges lies to a large extent on the shoulders of our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, whose performance\nover the last two years has fully justified our confidence in\nhim. The Kingdom of Swaziland pays a tribute to his skill,\nvision and leadership, as we face increasing challenges -\ninternal as well as external - to our Organization. We are\nconfident in his ability to act on behalf of us all, as the\nUnited Nations strives to maintain peace and security\nthroughout this troubled world and as we continue to fulfil\nthe hopes and wishes of our peoples, through the promotion\nof social and economic development in all Member States.\nWe offer our Secretary-General the fullest support and\nencouragement in the difficult times ahead.\n\nSwaziland is delighted to extend the hand of friendship\nto our six new Members, including our own African\ncontinent\u2019s newest nation, Eritrea. Earlier this year, we\npraised the United Nations-sponsored elections, which\nallowed Eritrea a peaceful transition to independence, and\nwe welcomed it to the Organization of African Unity family\nof African nations. Now, that welcome is extended to this\nlarger family.\nThe admission of these new countries is further proof\nof the importance we place on embracing all peoples within\nour Organization: the principle of universality - of\nrepresenting all the nations of the world - is one that has\nbeen at the very centre of the United Nation\u2019s existence,\nsince our establishment in 1945.\nAll groups of people, all nations, regardless of size or\nhistory, have a contribution to make towards ensuring a\nsafer, more prosperous world, in which we can live and\nwork in peace and provide the promise of economic and\npolitical security for future generations.\nJust one month ago Swaziland celebrated an event of\ngreat importance in the history of the Kingdom. Twentyfive years ago, on 6 September 1968, we regained our\nindependence and resumed our rightful place in the world\nonce more, as a free, sovereign nation.\nTo mark such an historic occasion, we hosted a large\nnumber of Heads of State and other representatives of\ncountries from every corner of our globe for three days of\ncelebration and rejoicing.\nWhile the event was one of great national jubilation,\nand an opportunity to give thanks to God for the many\nblessings he continues to bestow on us, it was also a chance\nto review the progress of the nation\u2019s development; to\nexamine our successes and failures; and to learn from the\nlessons of our first 25 years as a nation reborn.\nWe were also able to confirm the steps we are taking\nto continue in our quest to bring all Swazis once more under\nthe protection of our leadership. A committee has been\nestablished and negotiations are under way to restore the\nland and the people that have been lost to us over the last\ncentury. We shall be keeping this Organization fully\ninformed of developments.\nMost prominent among Swaziland\u2019s blessings have\nbeen the peace and stability we have continued to enjoy\nthroughout these times of great change and disorder. As a\nnation, we confirmed how important a role our unity plays\nin preserving the conditions for our stability, and\ndemonstrated what we could do to ensure that those\nconditions will be enjoyed by future generations.\nWe acknowledged that two factors have contributed\nmost to our unity: first, the emphasis we have always\nplaced on those aspects of our national character that make\nus unique from others - our traditions, our customs and our\nculture; and, secondly, our policy of always acting in\nconsensus, wherever possible, on issues of national\nimportance.\nThese traditional values which continue to guide and\nlead us today may seem old-fashioned and out of date in\ntoday\u2019s world. But they have served Swaziland well and\nwill continue to bind the Swazi nation together for many\ngenerations to come.\nI do not wish to give the impression that time has stood\nstill for us in our remote corner of the African continent -\nfar from it. Swaziland, too, has felt the winds of change\nwhich have blown throughout the world; and together, as a\nfamily, we have bent to accommodate them, for the good of\nthe nation as a whole.\nOne current example is the process of political reform\non which we are embarked.\nAs I mentioned a few moments ago, Swaziland is\ngoverned by the principle of rule by consensus of the people.\nThrough the ages, our leaders have ruled with the consent of\nthe nation, and this principle continues today. So when the\neffects of global political reform began to be felt in the\nKingdom, all Swazis were given the opportunity to offer\ntheir individual opinions on the need for change.\nThe result was a series of recommendations by the\nmajority of the Kingdom to bring about a number of\ndemocratic reforms, of which the most important concerned\nchanges in our electoral system to allow direct and\naccountable representation in Parliament.\nThe decision by the people to implement the changes\nwas announced last October, and the first stage of elections\nunder the new system was successfully conducted a week\nago. The final stage will take place in 10 days\u2019 time.\nOur new-found political maturity has also resulted in\nthe lifting of certain restrictive measures which, for various\nreasons, had been thought necessary in the past.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 3\nThese moves, and indeed the process throughout, has\nbeen warmly welcomed and supported wholeheartedly by the\ninternational community. More importantly, it has fulfilled\nthe wishes of the vast majority in Swaziland.\nAhead of us lies the implementation of the other\nrecommendations made by the Kingdom. We shall take\nthese steps forward in the way we always conduct business -\nquietly, peacefully and with the consent of all our people.\nI give this outline of recent reforms in Swaziland not\nfrom any need to justify our actions to the outside world, nor\nindeed to gain the approval of the international community.\nNo, I simply offer it as an example of the importance we, as\na nation, place on our unity, and on the principle of meeting\nfresh challenges together, as a family.\nSwaziland\u2019s internal policy is mirrored in our dealings\nwith the outside world. Throughout our history, we have\nconsistently pursued a policy of encouraging the settlement\nof all disputes through peaceful dialogue and negotiation.\nWe are heartened that this principle is shared by the United\nNations in its attempts to maintain global peace and security.\nIt is a distressing fact that the challenges facing the\nUnited Nations in this regard have reached a level perhaps\nwithout equal since its establishment at the end of the last\nglobal conflict.\nThe consequences of the breakup of the former Soviet\nUnion, in particular, have focused world attention on\ncontinental Europe, where the situations in the former\nYugoslavia and Georgia continue to give us all great cause\nfor concern.\nThe horrors of the war in Bosnia reinforce the belief\nthat we need some way of limiting the effects of tension\nbefore they are allowed to expand and explode.\nSwaziland has fully supported the efforts of the United\nNations and the European Community to bring about a\nnegotiated settlement to the conflict; and we recognize the\nwork of those involved in the process towards peace.\nSpecial mention must be made of the contribution of\nthe members of the United Nations Protection Force\n(UNPROFOR) in Bosnia, who risk their lives daily in their\ncourageous attempts to bring relief to the suffering of so\nmany. We urge the leaders of the three sides to find the\nbasis for a peaceful settlement before the start of a winter\nwhich many thousands will otherwise not have a chance of\nsurviving.\nNot far away, in Georgia, we have witnessed with\nconcern the unfolding of another tragedy whose\nconsequences may well be felt for some time to come.\nSwaziland urges those involved, with the support from those\nhaving influence in the area, to learn from the suffering of\nBosnia and to find a peaceful, negotiated settlement to the\ndispute that has ruined the stability of a nation which so\nrecently rejoiced in its new-found independence.\nThe last two weeks have seen the internal political\nstruggle in Russia reach a critical point, constituting a very\nserious threat to the stability of that great country.\nMost countries in the world have learned from bitter\nexperience that there is no easy path to reform, no certain\nblueprint, no overnight success.\nAs a country with enormous strategic and historical\nimportance, Russia has held our attention throughout its\noften painful transition, and our thoughts are with its people\nduring this latest internal crisis. Swaziland joins the rest of\nthe international community in supporting a peaceful\nresolution to the constitutional struggle on whose outcome\nthe peace of the entire region may depend.\nCyprus continues to give cause for concern to my\ndelegation, fully 19 years after the short but destructive\nconflict that brought division to that unhappy island.\nSwaziland shares with Cyprus membership in the British\nCommonwealth of Nations, and we support the untiring\nefforts of our Secretary-General to promote dialogue\nbetween Greeks and Turks so that a lasting settlement,\nacceptable to all, may be found.\nCloser to home, for many of our brotherly African\ncountries conflict and internal strife continue to be the\nmajor obstacles in the way of the development of the\ncontinent as a whole. Of particular distress to us in southern\nAfrica is the appalling disaster which has overtaken our\nbrothers in Angola, where more tragedies occur each day\nthan anywhere else in the world. If any country has suffered\nenough it is surely Angola. No reason can possibly justify\nthe scale of the disaster suffered by so many. We therefore\nsupport the measures taken by the United Nations to bring\nabout an end to the conflict, and we appeal to those\nresponsible for the continuation of the suffering to allow\nsense and reason to prevail. The elections last September\nwere judged free and fair by organizations of which we are\na member and whose views we respect. We appeal to both\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsides to come together in a spirit of understanding and\ncompromise to achieve a lasting peace for the whole\ncountry. The efforts of our United Nations Special Envoy\nin this difficult and dangerous assignment deserve our fullest\nsupport.\nOn the other side of our continent, we continue with\ngrave concern to look on the situation in Somalia, where,\ndespite the efforts of the large United Nations force and a\nlarge measure of success at the start of the operation, a\nformula for lasting peace still cannot be found. Swaziland\ngives due praise to the members of the peace-keeping force\nas they attempt to maintain the conditions in which food and\nmedical relief can reach those most in need. Clearly, the\nsupport of the international community will be necessary for\nthe foreseeable future - despite the enormous drain this will\nmean on our limited resources - as efforts are made to help\nestablish suitable political conditions in the country to\nencourage sustainable development.\nDespite these setbacks to global peace, the last 12\nmonths have seen considerable successes recorded in other\nareas, many of which owe much to the efforts of the United\nNations. In this Hall on Monday, President Clinton spoke\nof the determination of his Administration to continue with\nthe policy of encouraging an end, once and for all, to the\nspread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.\nSwaziland supports any measure to limit the ability of all\ncountries to make political use of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and we call on all the nuclear Powers to give the\ninitiative the support it deserves.\nOf perhaps greatest immediate significance in the area\nof global peace, however, was the recent signing of the\npeace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. Swaziland joins the rest of the world in\nwelcoming with enormous relief this sign of real progress\ntowards peace in the Middle East. We acknowledge those\nwho have contributed to this first, vital step towards a\nsettlement of the crisis which has afflicted the region for so\nlong. In particular, the determination of the two leaders,\nPrime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat, to bring about\nthe conditions for a settlement deserves the praise of us all.\nMeanwhile, along with the rest of the world, we\nrecognize that many challenges lie ahead in the process of\nreconciliation and peaceful resettlement. Above all, there\nmust be a firm commitment to the process from all nations\nin the region. The responsibility for a successful future lies\nas much with the neighbouring countries as it does with\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nSwaziland therefore welcomes the immediate favourable\nresponse to the treaty from many in the region, and we offer\nour wholehearted support to the process begun with that\nhistoric handshake. Our hopes and prayers for lasting peace\nare with the people of the Middle East.\nThe successful conclusion of another long-running\nconflict owes much to the efforts of the United Nations and\nis worth highlighting. The free and fair elections in\nCambodia have, hopefully, brought an end to many years of\nsuffering by the Cambodian people and fully justified the\nsupport we, as Member States, gave to the process.\nChallenges to peace in that country remain, however,\nand, while welcoming the moves to unite the people behind\na newly established monarchy, Swaziland is concerned that\nany remaining differences be resolved through negotiation,\nand not by the means that, in the past, gave rise to such\nhatred and division among the Cambodian people.\nAfrica, too, has experienced encouraging developments\nover the past 12 months. Of particular relevance to\nSwaziland have been the ongoing peace processes in the\nneighbouring countries of Mozambique and South Africa.\nLater this month we shall formally begin the process of\nreturning the tens of thousands of Mozambican refugees to\ntheir homeland. Swaziland has hosted these unfortunate\nvictims of civil war for many years, with the assistance of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We\npraise all those who have contributed to the peace effort.\nAbove all, we recognize the willingness of both sides to\nbring an end to the suffering of so many fellow-countrymen.\nWe therefore acknowledge the commitment to peace of\nPresident Chissano and Mr. Dhlakama, who have given an\nexample to the leaders of other countries experiencing\ninternal struggles. We pray that the peace process will be\nallowed to run its course, with the assistance of the United\nNations force that is stationed in the country. Swaziland\nstands ready to help Mozambique to regain its significance\nin the region.\nThe situation in South Africa - our other neighbour -\ntoo gives some reason for long-term hope of a peaceful\ntransition to majority rule and the birth of a new South\nAfrica. This view has been strengthened by the speeches\nthat President De Klerk and Mr. Mandela made in the\nUnited States last week. The negotiation process has\nproceeded in accordance with a tight timetable, and\nimportant successes have been recorded. I refer, for\nexample, to the recent agreement concerning conditions for\nthe establishment of the Transitional Executive Council.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 5\nThe setting of a date for elections - April 1994 - is of\nparticular importance as it provides a focus for the black\ncommunity, which has been denied the vote for so long.\nHowever, major obstacles remain if next year\u2019s election date\nis to be met. Prominent among these is the distressing\ncontinued violence in many sections of South African\nsociety. This has resulted in widespread loss of confidence\nin the peace process. We appeal to the leaders of all parties\nin South Africa to impose the maximum restraint on those\nwho threaten the real progress that has been made so far.\nWe pray that reason will prevail and that the existing forum\nfor peaceful negotiation will be used for the resolution of\nany differences.\nA matter of equal concern, and with the potential to\ngive rise to greater problems in the long term, is the absence\nfrom the negotiations of representatives of large sections of\nthe country. Empty chairs at the negotiating table will result\nin an incomplete solution to the problem of creating a new\nSouth Africa. All South Africans must be represented at the\ntalks, so that each may feel that he is a part of the solution.\nConditions must be found to give all in South Africa,\nregardless of race or belief, a voice in the transition process.\nIn the meantime, in accordance with the wishes of the\nmajority of South Africans, Swaziland supports the call for\nthe lifting of the remaining economic and trade sanctions\nagainst South Africa, to enable the country to begin the long\nand difficult process of resolving the many development\nchallenges it faces.\nSwaziland looks forward to welcoming a new South\nAfrica as a major force in the development of the region.\nFurther north in our continent, the recent signing of the\npeace accord in Liberia will, we hope, bring to an end a\nlong and painful chapter in the history of that unhappy\ncountry. Swaziland endorses the offer of the United Nations\nearlier this year to assist in the electoral process. We appeal\nto all Liberian leaders to respect the peace process and to\nput their faith in the electoral system, so that the country\nmay begin the task of rebuilding in an atmosphere of\nnational unity and conciliation.\nAs we examine the extent of United Nations\ninvolvement in peace-keeping operations around the world,\nit is clear that we face major questions about our ability to\ncope with future conflict situations. While Swaziland salutes\nthe courage and dedication of the 80,000 men and women of\nthe various United Nations forces on assignment in 17\nseparate operations throughout the world, we support the call\nof other Members for a full examination of the way in which\nour peace-keeping operations are managed, with a view to\nsecuring the maximum benefit from our limited resources.\nWe are approaching our fiftieth anniversary, and this is\na suitable moment to review our past performance in this\narea and to draw on our collective experience so that in\nfuture peace-keeping roles we may make the most efficient\nuse of our resources. Swaziland therefore welcomes the call,\nin the Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", for\ndiscussion of these vital issues during the current session.\nAt the beginning of my address I expressed the Swazi\ndelegation\u2019s welcome for the accession of six new Members\nas an indication of the Organization\u2019s respect for the\nprinciple of universality. We confirmed that it is a basic\nhuman right of all peoples to be represented at the United\nNations so that the widest possible range of opinions and\nexperience may be pooled, and the benefits of the\nOrganization shared by all countries.\nThe President returned to the Chair.\nYet the Kingdom of Swaziland has enjoyed a long and\nhappy relationship with 21 million people who believe that\nthey have had no representation here since 1971: I refer to\nthe people of the Republic of China.\nFor the past 25 years the Republic of China has shown\nitself to be a true friend of Swaziland. We have benefited\nfrom the experience of development which has lifted the\nRepublic of China to a position high on the list of\nindustrialized nations. The rest of the world has been\nexcluded from that experience and from the positive\ncontribution that we feel the Republic of China can make to\nthe international community. It is a contribution that the\nGovernment and the people of that nation have demonstrated\ntheir will and desire to make. And 21 million people feel\nthat they are denied the right of representation here in the\nUnited Nations by men and women of their own choice. In\nthe interest of equity and justice, their collective voice\ndeserves to be heard.\nSwaziland therefore supports the call from other\nMember States for the establishment of an ad hoc committee\nto look into the issue of the Republic of China\u2019s re-entry\ninto the United Nations.\nFollowing from the issue of basic human rights among\nnations, Swaziland attached great importance to our\nattendance at the Conference in Vienna last June. We made\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nclear the priority we attach to the promotion and protection\nof human rights in our own country and the important role\nwe believe that plays in the maintenance of peace and\nstability throughout the world.\nThe principle of equality among nations is one that has\nguided our foreign policy since independence, and we join\nother Member States in welcoming the Conference\u2019s\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. We look forward to\nthe discussion here in the General Assembly of proposals\nagreed at the Conference, and we stand ready to implement\nthem where necessary.\nFor many years after independence the Kingdom of\nSwaziland enjoyed a period of steady growth and reasonable\nprosperity, despite the difficulties experienced by other\ndeveloping nations in our region. The world-wide economic\nrecession and the drought years of 1991 and 1992 meant an\nend to the expansion of our economy, and the Kingdom\nbraced itself for some tough times ahead. As a developing\ncountry we are heavily reliant on the economies of nations\nthat are more industrialized than ours, and the failure of the\nprojected world-wide recovery in 1993 has added to our\ndespair.\nWe have recognized that there are internal measures we\nmust take ourselves, and we are active in attempting to\nstrengthen our industrial and agricultural base; but we\nremain dependent on outside support to finance programmes\nto help achieve our objectives.\nThe Kingdom has begun a programme of action for our\nown economic development, based on the principle of\nnational consensus that was so successful in our political\nreforms. The United Nations continues to support us in the\nplanning and coordination of our efforts, and we will need\nthat support for some time to come if we are to experience\nthe growth we need for the economic security of future\ngenerations.\nOne area in which we have been concentrating much\neffort is the expansion of our export markets and our trade\nrelations with other countries. We have therefore been\nfollowing anxiously the prolonged process of concluding the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks. We\nhave a saying in Africa: \\\"When the elephants fight, the ants\nget squashed.\\\" For our small, developing nation, much\ndepends on the successful outcome of the talks. We are, in\nparticular, looking forward to an international trade package\nwhich will take full account of the needs of the developing\nnations and will make allowances for current trade\nagreements between us and the first world. Another\ndeadline is just two months away. We appeal to the world\u2019s\nmajor economic Powers to consider the long-term fate of our\npeople and not to be seduced by the short-term political\nadvantage to be gained from indecision and delay.\nAlthough we will be heavily reliant on the outcome of\nthe GATT talks, Swaziland and the other countries in the\nSouthern and Eastern African regions have followed the\nexample of other major trading blocs around the world and\nformed our own regional common markets. The Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), of which\nSwaziland is currently Vice-Chairman, and the Preferential\nTrade Area (PTA) for Eastern and Southern African States\nare models of inter-nation cooperation. Our objective is the\nimprovement of all our peoples through closer economic and\ntrade cooperation and development between member States.\nThrough our membership in these trade organizations, we are\ntrying to open up more regional markets to complement\nthose we have established overseas. Our long-term target is\nto achieve a measure of regional self-reliance, and it is one\nthat deserves the support of the developed world. SADC,\nthe PTA and other arrangements like them will succeed as\nlong as we can count on the support and commitment of\norganizations such as the United Nations. I commend them\nto this Assembly.\nSwaziland fully agrees with the United Nations in\nattaching importance to the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment among Member nations, and we welcome your\ncall, Mr. President, for an agenda for development to have\npriority focus in this session. In this regard, we intend to\ntake a full and active part in next year\u2019s conference on\npopulation and development, and the Heads of State summit\non social issues in 1995.\nThe concept of a holistic approach to development -\ntaking into account issues such as the environment, human\nsettlement, population management, productive employment\nand the easing of poverty - is one that forms the basis of our\nown nation\u2019s policies.\nWe are working hard to ensure that our development is\nsustainable for the benefit of future generations of Swazis -\njust as our forefathers made sacrifices to ensure a secure and\nprosperous heritage for us.\nWe therefore welcome any initiative that places\npopulation concerns at the centre of all social, economic,\npolitical and environmental activities and we look forward to\na worthwhile output from Cairo next year and from the\nsocial Summit in 1995.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 7\nIt has been an eventful and exciting year. The first\nsteps have been taken towards the resolution of many\nlong-standing problems, but many challenges remain.\nThe need for internal adjustments in the administration\nof the Organization has been clearly identified and we look\nforward to monitoring more effective operations as a result\nof the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General. Despite\nthese, the United Nations can be proud of its record over the\npast twelve months and the Kingdom of Swaziland salutes\nall those who have contributed to the many substantial\nachievements we have recorded.\nI should like to give my personal assurance that\nSwaziland will demonstrate its confidence in the\nOrganization by paying its dues on time and with great\nwillingness in the firm expectation that they will be put to\nthe best possible use. We urge all other Member States to\ntake the same attitude so that the Organization might have\nthe funds available to undertake the programmes of\nassistance that are so desperately needed throughout the\nworld.\nIn conclusion I should like to take this opportunity, on\nbehalf of Her Majesty, the Indlovukazi, and the whole Swazi\nnation, to express my deep gratitude to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and all its sister agencies,\nfor the many programmes of assistance undertaken in\nSwaziland since its independence.\nWe believe that the United Nations remains the only\ntruly global forum for confronting the challenges facing the\nworld today, and the only body with the resources and the\ncommitment to implement the solutions. The world would\nindeed be a more troubled place without the combined\nefforts of all of us here.\nWe take pride in reaffirming our commitment to the\nprinciples and ideals contained in our founding Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great\npleasure to congratulate Ambassador Insanally on his\nelection to the high office of President of the General\nAssembly.\nI should also like to welcome the new Members of our\nOrganization: Andorra, Eritrea, the Czech Republic,\nMonaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and\nSlovakia.\nThe historic and courageous breakthrough in the Middle\nEast tells us that even the deepest trench can be bridged.\nConflict has tormented that entire region for most of this\ncentury. It has brought super-Powers to the brink of war.\nIt has placed enormous burdens on the United Nations itself.\nIt has deprived families of their dear ones and held people\nunder the ominous spell of fear.\nNow we must seize the moment. Now we are at a\nturning point for the United Nations as well. Now we must\nanswer the clarion call and mobilize our collective political\nand financial resources to help move the peace process\nforward.\nThe time has come to let the divisive, acrimonious\nMiddle East debates and decisions of the past fade into\nhistory. Israeli and Palestinian leaders have made reality of\nthe seemingly impossible. We would fail abysmally in our\nduties should we falter now in our efforts to support the\nprocess of prying peace out of the knot of conflict, a process\nwhich men and women of vision have dared to think, dared\nto do.\nDue to our long-standing relations with the parties, both\nour friendship with Israeli leaders and the mutual trust we\nhave established with the Palestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO), Norway was privileged to contribute to these\ndefining dramatic events.\nIn this spirit, we shall go to Washington on 1 October,\ncommitted to help in building peace. For the peace process\nto succeed, it must be consolidated and stabilized by the\neconomic development the two parties have agreed to\nundertake together.\nThe fruits of peace must become tangible and real for\nthe women, men and children of Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe process of implementation could change the perspectives\nand expectations of the parties, convert interdependence into\na sense of community, and make possible solutions and\nvisions which today seem beyond reach.\nThe economic situation in Gaza and on the West Bank\nis dramatic and calls for immediate and extensive economic\naid. Now we must respond to the just but unfulfilled\naspirations of the Palestinians: for job opportunities and for\nschools, hospitals and universities. Now we must assist in\nbuilding houses, roads and water supplies, and make\nreconciliation pay, so that new generations of Israelis and\nPalestinians may grow up without fear, as good neighbours,\nin a life of dignity.\nA period of healing is needed in which all peace-loving\ncountries, the United Nations itself, the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, other financial institutions and the European\nCommunity join financially - and substantially - in a\ncoordinated, immediate investment-for-peace programme. I\npledge and confirm that Norway\u2019s assistance will be\nsubstantial and that we shall be honoured to play a\ncontinuing political role should the parties so desire.\nA period of renewal and change must also embrace\nSouth Africa and our relations with that country. South\nAfrica is in desperate need of peace and reconciliation.\nFixing a date for democratic elections in April next year is\na beacon of hope that the post-Apartheid system will finally\ngain the democratic legitimacy which the South African\nGovernment cannot claim today.\nUntil the day when black South Africans can enjoy the\nhuman rights of which they have been oppressively deprived,\nuntil the day when violence is ended and joint political\ncontrol has been established over the military and police\nforces, until that day South Africa will remain a country in\nimperative transition.\nThe outside world and the United Nations must, in\ntime, recognize the potential of post-apartheid South Africa -\nat peace with itself and endowed with immensely rich\nnatural and human resources - for the whole region of\nsouthern Africa. Education and training are needed for\ngenerations which are now ready to assume an equal role in\nthe economy of their country. We must now act forcefully,\nencouraging proponents of peace and transition, and\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 21\ndiscourage the shrill voices of hatred and interposition so\nthat one day - soon - the South African man and woman\nmay be free at last.\nWe must never lose hope that peace can be achieved.\nBut our hope has been severely tested by the protracted\natrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There seems to be no\nlimit to the brutality that human beings are capable of\nmobilizing in the service of a nationalistic goal. Such acts\nhave been committed in the name of a doctrine - the\ndoctrine of the ethnic state - and thus prolong the sinister\nexistence of doctrine as a source of war and contention in\nthis century.\nEthnic nationalism is a threat to peace and stability\neverywhere. The ethnic mosaic of Europe does not lend\nitself to such reduction. A doctrine of the ethnic state is a\nprescription for war. Our task is to build communities\nwhich include rather than exclude and to make all\nmulti-ethnic regions safe refuges of enlightened diversity.\nA military victory in which aggression appears to pay\nin Bosnia will be noted in those parts of the world where\ndifferent nationalities are sharing territory and political\norganization. In the former Soviet Union alone, ethnic\ntensions are reaching critical mass or have already erupted,\nas in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.\nThe authority of the United Nations is seriously\nundermined if there is vacillation on where and how to use\nthe \\\"Blue Helmets\\\". We should admit that there have been\nfailures along the way and learn from experience. Our main\nthrust must be to aim for a negotiated solution based on\nknown elements. The alternative to a negotiated settlement\nis continued bloodshed. The alternative to peace is war.\nNorway fully supports the efforts of Thorvald Stoltenberg\nand David Owen. All parties must now cease hostilities and\nallow time for the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina to\nheal so that we can start slowly to build a foundation for\npeace. Let us be inspired by the Israelis and the\nPalestinians, and let us all send a message to the parties in\nBosnia: enough! Peace is possible.\nThe time for a settlement is long overdue. The\nsituation is already disastrous, and another winter of war is\nbound to take a severe toll of lives. Norway is among the\nmajor providers of humanitarian assistance to the area.\nInternational attention is focused on the terrible ordeal of the\nMuslims, but there are Croats and Serbs who suffer greatly\nas well. We should be even-handed in our humanitarian\nassistance, making a clear distinction between, on the one\nhand, warlords and war criminals and, on the other, those on\nall sides who are without a voice and without a choice, those\nwho are victimized and whose only hope is the assistance\nwe can provide from the outside.\nIt is absolutely imperative to improve on the\ncoordination and cooperation between United Nations\npeace-keeping operations, United Nations humanitarian\nagencies and non-governmental humanitarian organizations.\nSomalia is an obvious case in point. For Norway it is a\npriority issue to move such coordination forward. We shall\nconvene a conference before the end of the year with the\naim of improving our capacity to organize real peace\noperations incorporating both humanitarian and military\ntasks.\nWe should all support our Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposals for a necessary strengthening of the Department of\nPeace-keeping Operations. The management organization\nfor United Nations peace-keeping operations here in New\nYork is manifestly inadequate. The result is that troop-\ncontributing nations exercise direct control, which radically\nreduces coherence and effectiveness. The situation is\naggravated by the Security Council\u2019s propensity to make\nambitious decisions but fail to provide the Secretariat with\nthe means to implement them. Failing to provide financial,\nhuman and technological resources undermines both peace\nand the authority of the United Nations.\nWe know what needs to be done. We must focus on\nthe following: There must be realistic mandates for new\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations whose goals and\nmeans must be clearly defined. We must have proper\nstand-by arrangements for troops and equipment from\nMember States, and Norway is prepared to contribute in\nconcrete terms to a collective stand-by effort. We need\nimproved training and analysis of past experience; our\ntraining facilities should be linked in a consortium for United\nNations peace-keeping training. There must be an\nimmediate and substantial increase in the United Nations\nreserve fund for peace-keeping; moreover, a unified peace--\nkeeping budget must be introduced which allows the\nSecretary-General to obligate at least 20 per cent of the\nestimated cost of peace-keeping operations once they have\nbeen approved by the Security Council. We need improved\nfinancing for peace-keeping operations and financial\ndiscipline among Member States.\nIndeed, the whole financial situation of the United\nNations is disgraceful. As the eighth-largest contributor to\nthe United Nations system in absolute terms and by far the\nlargest in per capita terms, we find it exceedingly difficult to\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nunderstand how so many countries fail to honour their\nobligations.\nThe Secretary-General has said that \\\"the Organization\nlives from hand to mouth.\\\" (Statement by the Secretary-\nGeneral to the Fifth Committee, 26 August 1993). The\npermanent members of the Security Council have a special\nresponsibility. But we should also ask ourselves if countries\nshould be eligible at all for the Security Council if they have\nnot paid their contributions.\nThe post-cold-war patterns of risks and uncertainties\nhave brought about a wider recognition and understanding of\nthe need to address the serious economic and social\ninequalities in the world and their implications for global\nsecurity. Core issues such as environment and development\nused to be seen as side issues by the prime movers of\ninternational affairs. There is a new hope that this could be\nchanging.\nThe Secretary-General points out in his report that\nwithout sustainable development peace cannot long be\nmaintained and that political, social, educational and\nenvironmental factors must all be part of development.\nUnsustainable production and consumption patterns still\nprevail and can be counteracted only by changing how and\nin which fields our economies continue to grow. If current\nforms of development were employed, a further fivefold to\ntenfold boost in economic activity would be required over\nthe next 50 years to meet the needs and aspirations of 10\nbillion people.\nCurrently, the vast majority who are poor make only a\nminimal claim to our natural resources, while the more\nvoracious North is consuming in a few decades what it has\ntaken the planet billions of years to accumulate. The\nNorwegian Minister of the Environment raised the issue of\nproduction and consumption patterns in the industrial part of\nthe world at the first session of the Commission on\nSustainable Development. Early next year Norway will host\na meeting on these issues as a contribution to the next\nsession of the Commission.\nThe rapid population growth in many parts of the world\nis a ticking time-bomb. Ninety per cent of this increase is\ntaking place in developing countries, many of which are\nunable to feed their present populations. We may soon be\nfacing new famine of a magnitude dwarfing even Malthus\u2019\ngloomiest predictions. There may be mass migration and the\ndestabilization of countries and regions as people compete\nfor ever-scarcer land and water resources.\nThe International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, to take place in Cairo in September 1994,\nmust address the complex root causes of the population\nexplosion.\nThe agreements reached at the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development in Rio last\nyear, however imperfect, set a sound, ambitious agenda for\naction to ensure sustainable development. Yet, I regret to\nsay, the momentum generated in Rio has been allowed to\nlose some of its force.\nThe world will not forget, and our children will long\nremember, that the industrialized countries committed\nthemselves in Rio to providing new and additional funding\nto combat climate change and safeguard biological diversity.\nSo far, however, contributions have been small-scale.\nThe aid fatigue continues despite enormous needs and\na more fertile ground for development in countries which\nhave made sacrifices and taken the bitter but crucial\nmedicine of structural adjustment, and despite the reduction\nof military budgets to levels where countries again should be\ndeemed creditworthy.\nFar, far more serious, and not only for the developing\nworld, is the gambling with the Uruguay Round holding the\nprospects of global free trade hostage to narrow national\ninterests. For most countries, strongly dependent as they are\non international trade, an agreement, even if each and every\nprovision may not be ideal, is absolutely necessary. I urge\nthe major parties to live up to the expectations created at the\nGroup of 7 meeting in Tokyo that before the end of the year\nthe deal will be closed.\nEnvironment and trade must be the next agenda item.\nWe should be more outspoken about conflicting interests and\nmore receptive to the fact that we do not have the option to\ngo our separate ways.\nWe must develop a sound, scientific basis for managing\nour natural resources in a sustainable way. In a politically,\nculturally and socially diverse world, science and knowledge\ncan be the only basis for sound and lasting cooperation in\nthis field.\nAnd while we reduce our strain on finite natural\nresources, the environmental agenda is constantly widened\nby the unveiling of the ecocide almost committed by the\nformer Communist countries.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 23\nThe nuclear threat is not confined to that inherent in the\nremaining arsenals of nuclear weapons. Increasingly, our\nsecurity is threatened by the enormous deposits of nuclear\nwaste on land and at sea. Large-scale international\ncooperation is required to eliminate this threat.\nNuclear weapons have not disappeared, and the capacity\nto make them is broadly present. Proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction and the means of their delivery\nconstitutes perhaps the greatest threat to international peace\nand stability. It is a matter of utmost priority to broaden and\ndeepen the non-proliferation regime to comprise a broader\npattern of commitments and cooperative behaviour. In this\nconnection, Norway urges the nuclear-weapon States to\nredouble their efforts to conclude a comprehensive test-ban\ntreaty. We expect that they will refrain from any testing\nwhile negotiations proceed. We also urge North Korea to\nsubmit fully to the safeguard regime of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency and to adhere to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\nDevelopment without democracy and respect for human\nrights will never be sustainable. Democracy is indispensable\nfor promoting and upholding respect for human rights, for\nsocial and economic development, for peace and security,\nand for liberating the human creativity which is so vital to\nany social and economic development.\nI urge this Assembly to create the post of high\ncommissioner for human rights and to agree on a quantum\nleap in the allocation of resources for the United Nations\nhuman-rights activities. This is a modest price to pay for\nstrengthening the basis for peace and stability.\nThe lines between foreign and domestic policies have\nlong since vanished. Narrow-minded forms of nationalism\nwill not serve us. We must move towards an inclusive\nenlargement where the powerful are just and the weak\nsecure. Only the United Nations can provide the framework\nof a better-organized world, which today is too fragmented\nand uncoordinated. More and more causes are common, as,\nindeed, is our whole future.\nThe Middle East breakthrough gives us the hope that no\nchallenge is too difficult and the belief that we can make\nthis world a civilized place.\n"

I am delighted to see\nhim directing our work and I am convinced that in the\nchoice it has made, the General Assembly intended to\nhonour his country, which has been devoted to the cause of\npeace and international cooperation.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank his\npredecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the contribution he made\nto the work of the forty-seventh session and for the great\nskill he evinced at that time.\nIt is also a pleasant duty to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the Organization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for\nhis efforts and the determination in implementing the\nobjectives and decisions of the United Nations aimed at\nresolving conflicts throughout the world. His is far from an\neasy task, particularly since those conflicts have multiplied\nand the activity and role of the United Nations today have\nincreased as well.\nI should also like to congratulate the new Member\nStates that have acceded recently to membership of our\nOrganization and to welcome their delegations here present.\nI am quite certain that they will make their own valuable\ncontributions to what is being done by the United Nations to\npromote peace and cooperation between nations.\nAfter the spectacular upheavals that the world has\nundergone, the current session provides us with a propitious\nopportunity to take a close look at the circumstances and the\nprospects offered by these changes and to consider ways and\nmeans of strengthening our Organization and its new fields\nof action, particularly on the basis of preventive diplomacy\nand on building relationships of trust and cooperation\nbetween States.\nStarting from 7 November 1987, Tunisia has been\nengaged in laying the foundations of a modern and advanced\nState capable of adapting to the changes that have taken\nplace and continue to take place in the world. Tunisia hopes\nthat after the era of dogmatism and ideology, the world will\nbe able to evince greater maturity by putting more vigour in\nstriving for cooperation between nations and solidarity\nbetween peoples.\nOne of the signs of such maturity is undoubtedly the\ndynamic peace process in the Middle East. There can be no\ndoubt that the premisses of peace in the Middle East which\nare now attracting the attention of the entire international\ncommunity are an indication that an end to decades of\nconfrontation, destruction and suffering is now in view.\nThe historic mutual recognition between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization and the declaration of\nprinciples relating to the occupied territories are all\nimportant signposts along the road towards recognition of the\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and are a cause\nfor hope that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle\nEast is in the offing.\nTunisia, while welcoming these developments, would\nlike to voice the hope that Israel will show the necessary\ncourage to reach agreement with the Arab parties concerned\nin order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will\nguarantee that all the peoples of the region will live in\nsecurity and stability, and that in the place of strife and\nconflict there will be good-neighbourliness.\nDevoted as it is to the universal values of peace and\njustice, Tunisia will continue to endeavour to give impetus\nto this dynamic peace process in the Middle East with a\nview to undoing the knot of the crises and conflicts that\nbeset the world today.\nIn line with this stance, Tunisia has made a point of\nbeing associated with the efforts of the international\ncommunity and with the work of the United Nations in the\nservice of peace, security and stability.\nIt is in this context that we should view Tunisia\u2019s\nparticipation in the operations involving supervision of the\nelections in Cambodia, despite the enormous difficulties that\nwere encountered.\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 17\nAlso, Tunisia recently responded to the United Nations\nappeal to take part in the Somali operation; unfortunately,\nthe situation seems to indicate that a return of peace in the\nshort term seems rather unlikely.\nTunisia also responded to the United Nations appeal to\nbe associated in United Nations efforts in the Western\nSahara, the purpose of which is to lay the groundwork for\nholding a referendum.\nRegarding the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Tunisia once again appeals to the conscience\nof the world to work determinedly towards seeking a just\nsettlement based on law and international legality rather than\non the basis of fait accompli politics, so that a swift end may\nbe put to this tragedy, particularly as winter is near.\nSince it remains faithful to its Arab and Islamic\nidentity, and since it also belongs to the Maghreb, Tunisia\nwill do everything it can to strengthen the ties of\nbrotherhood and cooperation in order to achieve our\nobjectives so that we may be able to realize the aspirations\nof our peoples of a better future. It is in this spirit that\nTunisia and Algeria have recently concluded an agreement\non the demarcation of the borders between our two fraternal\ncountries. The agreement will be deposited shortly with the\nUnited Nations.\nIn this context, we should like to express our sincere\nhope that all the problems in the Gulf region will be\nproperly and rationally resolved, including the boundary\ndisputes between Iraq and Kuwait and between the United\nArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that this\nwill be achieved by peaceful means in line with existing\nagreements and the norms of international legality, in\nkeeping with the new spirit which now inspires international\nrelations as well as with the aspirations of our world after\npeace and stability in this particularly sensitive region.\nTunisia\u2019s efforts on the Arab Maghreb\u2019s level in its\ncapacity as current president of the Arab Maghreb Union\naim at creating the necessary conditions that would enable\nus to make progress in building the Maghreb and\nstrengthening its role in the international arena. Building the\nedifice of the Maghreb is part and parcel of the current\ndevelopment of international relations, which favours\nregional groupings. We for our part are doing everything we\ncan to ensure that the Arab Maghreb Union keeps pace with\nevents in a way that will make it possible to establish\nfruitful relations in the international context and more\nparticularly with the regional Arab, European and\nMediterranean groups so that, as a group it may serve as an\ninstrument of peace and cooperation and a bastion of\nsecurity and stability.\nThe dispute between Libya, a member of the Arab\nMaghreb Union and three Western countries is a source of\ndeep concern for us. Tunisia has worked hard within the\nMaghreb framework and at the Arab level to find a\nnegotiated and honourable settlement that would safeguard\nthe interests of all parties and spare the region the risk of\nany escalation of tension and instability.\nTunisia has always worked for strengthening peace and\ncooperation in Africa. It is our hope that in future Africa\nwill reap the beneficial side-effects of the profound\ninternational political and economic changes that have taken\nplace, so that it may devote its efforts to development.\nTunisia, which has welcomed the process of change in\nSouth Africa, and looks forward with optimism to seeing the\nApril 1994 elections restore this great African country to a\nplace worthy of its standing within the African family, calls\nupon all political parties to respect the agreement that has\nbeen concluded, and to implement it in good faith so that the\npeoples of Azania can see an end to racism and the advent\nof a new era of democracy.\nThe establishment, at the most recent Summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity, of machinery for the\nmanagement and settlement of conflicts in Africa is also a\nsource of great satisfaction. In our view, this is evidence of\nthe determination of the African Heads of State to turn the\npage once and for all on wars and disputes and to embark\nupon a new era based on dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\nHenceforth, Africa will have to rely essentially on its\nown resources. However, it does need the support of the\ninternational community so that its efforts may succeed in\nachieving the goal of African development and African\nstability.\nAttention should be drawn to the suffering of many\nAfrican States as a result of upheavals and conflicts such as\nthose witnessed by Somalia, Liberia and Angola, which have\nnow become sources of major concern for the entire\ninternational community. The international community must\nnot remain unmoved by such events, which undermine whole\nStates and sap their potential. We believe that the\ninternational community is capable of contributing genuinely\nto national reconciliation in those countries, and that by so\ndoing it will make it possible to eliminate all the other\nsources of tension in the continent.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe profound changes in international relations have\nundoubtedly imparted a global dimension to the problems of\nthe world. International solidarity and cooperation in the\nnew shape they have taken, have become an absolute\nnecessity whether the issue in question has to do with the\nmaintenance of peace, disarmament, the upholding of human\nrights, or with addressing problems relating to the\nenvironment, demography and development.\nOn November 7th, Tunisia charted for itself an\nunswerving course in that area and boldly has taken several\ndecisive steps toward laying the foundations of a State that\nfunctions under the rule of law, through institutions that\nuphold fundamental freedoms. Thus the concepts and\nprinciples of human rights, freedom, pluralism, the rule of\nlaw and State institutions, have become constants on which\nall Tunisians unite around their President Ben Ali, in order\nto devote themselves to laying the foundations of our\nsociety.\nTunisia has spared no effort to ensure the success of the\nInternational Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, to\nfacilitate the successful elaboration of a common approach\nand to identify the appropriate machinery to ensure respect\nfor human rights.\nMy country remains convinced that development,\ncombatting poverty, the settlement of disputes that arise from\nforeign occupation, the elimination of racism and fanaticism,\nare all absolute imperatives in defending human rights of\npeople, ensuring the stability of States and enabling their\npeoples to progress.\nIn this respect, I should like to highlight one particular\nscourge namely the dangerous phenomenon of extremism\nand terrorism, especially that type of extremism which dons\nthe garb and mask of religion while, in spirit and action, it\nconstitutes a total negation of democracy and human rights.\nTunisia, which unmasked in time the doublespeak of\nthat type of extremism, has been able, through an overall\nstrategy of political, economic, cultural and social\nachievement, to contain this phenomenon and thwart its\ndesigns. Consequently, our country now enjoys safety,\nstability and continued progress.\nWe have listened with great attention to President\nWilliam Clinton when he spoke this morning of the risks\nwhich continue to threaten security and stability throughout\nthe world, particularly extremism - racial extremism above\nall - and religious extremism, which breed hatred and\nterrorism. Tunisia continues to appeal to the international\ncommunity to intensify its efforts to contain this\nphenomenon which sows anarchy and chaos in the bosom of\nthe international community and hampers the development\nprocess.\nIt is high time for the international community as a\nwhole to give serious thought to this phenomenon, to define\nits various forms and manifestations and to devise an\ninternational course of action and a legal framework to\ncombat it. We should also look for just foundations that\nwould reinforce the laws of asylum now in force in all\nStates.\nIt is obvious that while the right of asylum acquires a\nhumanitarian character and is essentially a part of State\nsovereignty, the granting of asylum should be in accordance\nwith certain ethical rules and principles which must be\nrespected.\nTunisia believes that the right of asylum is one of those\ncommon human values which must not be used for the\npurposes other than those for which they were created.\nThe persistence of old problems and conflicts which\ndrag on in various parts of the world, delays in development\nwhich plague a considerable segment of mankind highlight\nthe fragility of peace and security. Consequently, it is\nessential to work for genuine disarmament. It was in\nkeeping with this thinking that Tunisia acceded to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the Treaty banning the development of\nbiological weapons and signed, in January 1993, in Paris, the\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their\nDestruction.\nI hardly need to recall that the concept of security\ntranscends the purely military aspects and embraces various\nelements that encompass political stability and economic\nsecurity. This means we have to draw up an agenda for\ndevelopment as a necessary prerequisite for the success of\nAn Agenda for Peace.\nThe right of both present and future generations to live\nin a healthy environment is today at the very centre of the\nconcerns of the international community and is one of the\nmain concerns of my country.\nTo this end, Tunisia adopts a policy that combines\npreventive and remedial environmental programmes. That\npolicy has yielded so far, many tangible results, in areas\nsuch as the conservation and safeguarding of natural\nresources, the protection of fisheries and coastlines, and the\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 19\nimprovement of the quality of life. Ratification of the\ninternational conventions which followed the Earth Summit\nand the creation of a national Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment are all tangible facts which reflect Tunisia\u2019s\ncommitment to the implementation of the decisions of the\nRio de Janeiro Summit.\nIt goes without saying that steps taken at the national\nlevel can only be viable to the extent that the international\ncommunity succeeds in identifying the interrelationships\nbetween the problems of the environment and those of\ndevelopment.\nIn this connection, there is need for a new approach in\naddressing the issues of North-South relations. This means\nmoving towards strengthening of a multilateral economic\nsystem in order effectively to respond to the priorities of the\npoorer countries.\nTunisia has constantly given concrete expression to\ncooperation between the North and the South in its various\naspects because it is convinced of the interdependence of the\ninterests of the two groupings and the link between the\ngrowth and volume of assistance provided by the countries\nof the North. That is why it would be judicious to formulate\na new approach to international cooperation which would\nencompass development assistance, trade, investment and the\ntransfer of technology.\nTo avoid a North-South schism, the developed countries\nmust take account of the economic problems of the countries\nof the South, especially those problems that relate to the\ndevelopment process as well as the problems relating to the\nrestructuring of their economies and to indebtedness.\nWe cannot deal with international trade without taking\nup one vital question, namely the necessity of establishing a\nlink between the transfer of technology to the developing\ncountries and capital flows.\nIn this connection, it must be recalled that indebtedness\nand debt-servicing, in the case of the developing countries,\nin most cases is the main obstacle that impedes further\ndevelopment and hampers full participation in the world\neconomy.\nAlthough Tunisia has always honoured its financial\ncommitments I should like in this connection to reiterate\nsome proposals we made earlier on this subject: in\nparticular regarding the rescheduling of debt by creating a\nspecial fund to finance job-creating development projects.\nThere is no doubt that such projects, in addition to their\ndirect return which would be beneficial to the recipient\ncountries, will have the effect of settling populations in their\noriginal regions and thus contribute to reducing migratory\nflows to wealthier countries.\nIn this very Hall, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\nproposed a contract for peace and development that in our\nestimation, would strengthen the existing capabilities and\nenhance potential in the States of the North and of the South\nalike.\nIn his recent address to the European Parliament at\nStrasbourg in June 1993, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\nfurther proposed organizing a conference on the development\nof the Maghreb States with a view to establishing a new\npolitical, economic, social and cultural partnership between\nthe Maghreb and the European States.\nBefore concluding, I wish to touch on the question of\nthe restructuring of the organs of the United Nations. I want\nagain to welcome the initiatives of Mr. Boutros Boutros-\nGhali to adapt the universal Organization\u2019s structures to the\nongoing changes in international relations, to rationalize the\nactivities of the United Nations system and to reorganize the\nmethods of its functioning. The elements of the proposed\nreform package should be carefully considered and discussed\nby all Member States with a view to making the\nOrganization\u2019s new structure more efficacious.\nThe projected reforms - whether involving enlargement\nof the Security Council, redeployments in the Secretariat or\ncuts in spending - deserve our attention to the extent that\nthey take account of the interests of the developing\ncountries. We think the reforms should emphasize the\nprinciple of equality among Member States and guarantee\ndecision-making balance among the Organization\u2019s various\norgans, and particularly with respect to the Security Council\nand the General Assembly.\nLet me conclude by reiterating my wishes for the\nsuccess of the work of the forty-eighth session; we count on\nit to realize the hopes of the peoples of our world.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour to convey\nto all members of the Assembly the warm greetings and\ngood wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, King\nof Bhutan, for the success of the forty-eighth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\nI begin by congratulating you, Mr. President, on your\nunanimous election. We are confident that with your wide\nknowledge and experience you will provide proper direction\nto our discussions. We would also like to pay a tribute to\nour outgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the exemplary\nmanner in which he led the Assembly at the last session.\nWe extend a warm welcome to the peoples and\nGovernments of Andorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, The\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and the\nRepublic of Slovakia on their joining the family of nations.\nWe are confident that their membership will add to the\nstrength and vitality of the Organization.\nWe would like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dynamic\nleadership. His initiatives have already started to steer the\ncourse of the United Nations into new and bold directions.\nHis report to the Assembly is clear and concise and provides\na good basis for the work of this session.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 19\nThe momentous events taking place around us in this\nnew decade continue to pose challenges and offer\nopportunities of an unprecedented scale. The handshake on\nthe White House lawn between Prime Minister Rabin and\nChairman Arafat opened a window for peace and tolerance\nin the Middle East after a century of hatred and suspicion.\nWhen President Clinton called the agreement the \\\"peace of\nthe brave\\\", he paid just tribute to their courage. Deep-seated\nemotions will continue to blur reason and not all groups will\ntake to the road of healing at the same pace. We join those\ncalling on extremist factions on both sides to desist from the\nuse of force. My delegation hopes that the agreement will\nlead to a comprehensive and durable peace on the basis of\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We appeal to the\ninternational community to give even stronger support to the\nimplementation of the agreement in all its aspects.\nWith regard to the situation in the Persian Gulf, we\nurge all parties to abide by Security Council resolution 833\n(1993). It is our view that for the full recognition of\nKuwait\u2019s sovereignty, the boundary as demarcated by the\nUnited Nations must be internationally respected.\nMy delegation is happy with the progressive\ndismantling of apartheid and the process towards universal\nfranchise in South Africa. We have recently heard in this\nforum Mr. Mandela\u2019s historic call to end all sanctions\nagainst South Africa, a call which must be speedily\nhonoured.\nWe applaud the positive results of United Nations\ninvolvement in Cambodia, El Salvador and Haiti. These\nsuccesses, however, have not yet been replicated in Somalia\nand Bosnia. My delegation strongly condemns violence\nagainst United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian\nworkers. As the need for peace-keeping in other parts of the\nworld grows, it is clear that in future the terms of every\nintervention must be carefully defined.\nMy delegation welcomes the reduction in the\ninternational arsenal of nuclear and other weapons and we\nsupport the continuation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nbeyond 1995.\nWith regard to the nuclear situation on the Korean\npeninsula, we urge the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea to comply fully with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement in order to avoid any\nsuspicion and speculation.\nIn an age focused on reducing the world\u2019s nuclear\narsenal, further testing is unnecessary and inconsistent. We\nurge all nuclear States not to carry out further tests and to\ncontinue negotiations towards a comprehensive test ban.\nWhile the world\u2019s nuclear arms and other weapons of\nmass destruction are being dismantled, we are aware that\nconventional weapons are used in all present-day conflicts.\nNo country which supplies arms can dissociate itself from\nthe moral responsibility for the use of such arms. We fully\nsupport the United Nations Register on Conventional Arms\nand urge the reduction of the international arms trade.\nOver the past two years, considerable emphasis has\nbeen put on streamlining the United Nations Secretariat and\nmaking it more efficient. At the last two sessions the\nGeneral Assembly has directed its attention not only towards\nreforming and revitalizing the United Nations but also\ntowards making the General Assembly a more effective and\nresponsive forum. While some progress has been made, the\ndiscussion on reforming and restructuring the United Nations\ncontinues. We cannot expect the United Nations, formed\nnearly five decades ago with just 50 members, to remain\nunchanged and yet be able to fulfil the hopes and\nexpectations of the current 184 Members in a vastly different\nworld. Clearly, the reforms and revitalization cannot be\nlimited to managerial and organizational changes: the roles\nand responsibilities of all the principal organs of the United\nNations must be taken into account.\nMy delegation believes that during our discussion on\nreforming the United Nations, the time is opportune to\nenlarge the Security Council. The expansion of its\nmembership must be taken up together with the issue of\naccountability. While it is necessary to preserve the Security\nCouncil\u2019s new-found effectiveness, it must always be made\naccountable for its actions to the General Assembly.\nThe need for reform and restructuring seems in recent\nmonths to have been somewhat overshadowed by the\nOrganization\u2019s financial difficulties and questions of\neffective operations and proper accountability. We fully\nagree that it is necessary to minimize waste and streamline\noperations. These issues, however, must be pursued\nindependently of the concerns over the financial health of the\nUnited Nations. We urge all Members to pay their assessed\ncontributions promptly. We are of the view that the current\nlevel of assessment has fully taken into account both the\nfinancial capacity of Member States to contribute and the\nrole they have assumed in the Organization. There is a\nsaying in my country that one must load the pony according\nto its ability to carry the burden. Although the United\nNations has travelled far in the last three years, it is clear\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nnow that we cannot keep overloading it without putting the\nnecessary means and resources at its disposal.\nThe Second World Conference on Human Rights, held\nin Vienna this year, clearly recognized that social progress\nand political stability cannot be ensured without respect for\nhuman rights. The Conference also recognized that human\nrights and social progress can be promoted and preserved\nonly in a healthy economic and natural environment. For\nour part, we are fully committed to advancing the human\nrights of all our people.\nThis year, as agreed to in Agenda 21 of the Earth\nSummit, the Commission on Sustainable Development has\nbeen established. The work of this Commission will provide\na new direction for the preservation of the environment and\ngive added impetus to developmental activities. We\nrecognize that while all development must take place at local\nand national levels, there are clearly regional and\ninternational dimensions for which solutions must be found\nat the global level. Bhutan looks forward to participating in\nthe upcoming global conferences on population and\ndevelopment, the World Summit for Social Development and\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women.\nThe recession that has afflicted much of the world\neconomy in the past year has not shown any signs of\nimprovement. In such conditions, it is hardly surprising that\nthe economic performances of most of the world\u2019s least\ndeveloped countries have continued to be dismal. Per capita\nincome for the one tenth of the world\u2019s population which\nlives in these countries has fallen in the past three years\ndespite the adoption of the United Nations Programme of\nAction in 1990. While the least developed countries have\nbegun to initiate bold and painful structural reforms in their\neconomies, budget constraints on donor nations and\ncompeting claims on aid resources have continued to slow\ndown the flow of official development assistance to the least\ndeveloped countries. While expressing our gratitude to\ndonors who have met and even exceeded official\ndevelopment assistance targets, my delegation would like to\nappeal to the others to follow suit so that the reforms can be\nsustained and promoted.\nThe sluggish international economic climate in the last\ntwo years has been further compounded by a spate of\nunusually harsh natural disasters that have affected many\nparts of the world. We would like to express our heartfelt\nsympathies to all those in the United States of America,\nJapan, Nepal, and India who have suffered heavy loss of life\nand property because of recent natural calamities. The\ncapacity to respond to such disasters should be placed high\non the international agenda. This includes long-term\ninvestment in environmental conservation and other\nmeasures, including early warning facilities, to protect\nagainst natural disasters.\nBhutan continues to make considerable progress in the\nfield of social and economic development. We are currently\nin the process of decentralizing the administration in terms\nof decision-making and implementation of development\nprojects. We are also giving priority to the development of\nhuman resources. In all our nation-building activities, we\nhave sought to protect our rich natural environment and\ndistinctive national identity. In our efforts, we have\ncontinued to receive generous support from India, Japan,\nSwitzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Austria,\nNorway, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia, and\nfrom various specialized agencies and bodies of the United\nNations, particularly the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n(UNICEF), the United Nations Fund for Activites (UNFPA),\nthe United Nations Capital Development Fund, (UNCDF),\nthe International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\nthe World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations\nVolunteers (UNV), the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization\n(WHO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), and the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO). I take this opportunity to express the sincere\ngratitude of the people and Government of Bhutan to our\ndevelopment partners.\nThis is an age of multilateralism, and the United\nNations is the centre around which this new age will\nrevolve. The United Nations is no longer just the\nForty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 21\npreserver of world order but an active promoter of peace and\nhuman advancement. Increasing cooperation among its\nMembers since the end of the cold war has made it possible\nfor the Organization to become more effective in pursuing\nthese objectives. The long-term success of the United\nNations, in our view, will depend on how democratic it\nbecomes in its functioning and to what extent it will involve\nall its Members, large and small, in the decision-making\nprocess. We hope that the United Nations will become the\ncenterpiece of a more just and equitable world order and will\nspeak for the whole of humanity rather than just for a\nprivileged few.\n"

        "file_text": "Before commencing my address, I\nwould like to express, on behalf of my nation and myself,\nmy sincere sympathy with the people of India on this day of\ngreat tragedy.\nLet me convey to you, Mr. President, my\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nYour election is a fitting tribute to your personal and\nprofessional qualities, and also to your country, the Republic\nof Guyana. As an Estonian, I have a special empathy with\nyour homeland: much like Estonia, your\ncountry was liberated from colonial dependence and became\na Member State of the United Nations. Like Estonia, your\ncountry remembers that independence is the decisive factor\nwhich permits small countries to share with great Powers\nequal responsibility for creating a better world, towards\nwhich all of us, seated here in this Hall, are striving.\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\nI express my recognition for his proficiency in chairing the\nforty-seventh session. We also express our deep gratitude to\nMr. Ganev for visiting Estonia and her sister States Latvia\nand Lithuania, and for his efforts to apply the moral\nauthority of the United Nations towards removing the\nremaining vestiges of colonialism from the Baltic States.\nTo our neighbour in the General Assembly, the State of\nEritrea, I express my sincerest welcome and congratulations\non its finally joining the family of nations.\nI would, however, like to take this opportunity to\nextend especially warm thanks to the Secretary-General, His\nExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has given the\nUnited Nations and the whole world new hope through his\nstrong moral conviction that we need not passively wait for\nconflicts to arise, but that conflicts should be prevented from\narising; that the United Nations is, in the first place, an\narchitect, whose building must not be allowed to be engulfed\nin flames; that the Organization is only secondarily a fire-\nfighter who rushes to extinguish fires still burning from the\npast. This is so even and perhaps especially when,\nmetaphorically speaking, it happens that only a poor man\u2019s\ncowshed has caught fire - for after all, that was enough to\nburn down all of Chicago.\nLet me express my appreciation and gratitude for\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u2019s radiant moral sense of\nresponsibility and for the steadfastness with which he has\ndefended the principle of preventive diplomacy. As a small\nState, Estonia well understands and desires to support the\nSecretary-General fully in his defence of the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations and in the implementation\nof preventive diplomacy.\nThree years ago, in 1990, I visited the New York\nmeeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope as a foreign minister whose entry into the conference\nroom was strictly prohibited. I was interviewed by\ntelevision journalists in front of United Nations\nHeadquarters, as chance had it. I stated then that the next\ntime I would be here it would be for the raising of the\nEstonian flag. The journalists did not even attempt to hide\ntheir polite sympathy nor their desire to bring the interview\nquickly to an end. Did they even attempt to present such an\n\\\"unrealistic\\\" interview on their television programme?\nOne year later, in September 1991, I watched the\nraising of the Estonian flag on a United Nations flagpole and\nconcluded that my mission had been completed. Today I am\nhere to tell the Assembly, and perhaps also those\nsympathetic journalists, that my work as the first\ndemocratically elected post-war Estonian President has only\njust begun.\nToday my words are infused with self-confidence and\nhope. Estonia has been and is once again a State; Estonia\nhas re-established its place under the sun. In this sense we\nshare common attributes, experiences and goals with the vast\nmajority of States represented here today. The majority of\nthe States Members of the Assembly are only slightly larger\nor slightly smaller than Estonia, with its 47,000 square\nkilometres and 1.5 million inhabitants living on the shores of\nthe Baltic Sea. Estonia was robbed of its independence and\nforced to be the colonial subject of an imperial Power, as\nwas the case with the majority of the Members here today.\nJust as they did, so have we restored our independence at the\ncost of untold suffering. For Estonia, as for most of the\nMembers here, this work is still incomplete. The United\nNations General Assembly is the best place for uniting our\nforces, so that we can work together.\nThis however requires that the Second World War\nfinally end for Estonia. For the Second World War is still\ncontinuing in Estonia in a rather peculiar way, because the\nforeign armed forces which occupied Estonia in 1940 still\nremain on our territory, regardless of General Assembly\nresolution 47/21. Estonia has for two years patiently\nconducted negotiations on the withdrawal of these forces, but\nwithout positive results. Of course, we were aware that\nbehind this rigid position stood the Soviet nomenklatura and\nthe Russian so-called parliament, which acted on the basis of\nthe Brezhnevite Soviet so-called constitution and whose goal\nwas to restore the Soviet Union in a modernized form.\nPresident Yeltsin was a prisoner of this imperialistically\nminded parliament.\nFor this reason, we consider the present moment\nespecially opportune for President Yeltsin to strengthen the\nworld\u2019s confidence in democracy by withdrawing the\nremaining armed forces from Estonia and Latvia and by\nsigning international agreements to this effect. This would\nguarantee stability and security for the Baltic region, which\nis an inseparable part of Europe\u2019s Nordic region - and that\nregion, in turn, is an inseparable part of Europe.\nIn my correspondence with President Yeltsin I have\nemphasized my readiness to meet him in the nearest future.\nI would be grateful to the General Assembly, to the Security\nCouncil and to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali if,\nwith all their collective moral authority, they would help us\nrapidly to cut this Gordian knot. This is, after all, not only\na problem for Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania: with this effort\nthey would also be supporting the democratization of Russia.\nWith the implementation of preventive diplomacy, they\nwould be removing a potential source of conflict and would\nthereby strengthen the prestige of the United Nations itself.\nAnd last, but not least, by implementing international law\nequally in the interests of great Powers and of small States\nthey would give back to all of us the hope that, even in\nterms of realpolitik, justice is singular and indivisible.\nThe United Nations could mandate such a mission, to\nbe led by an authoritative European politician, one in whom\nboth Russia and the Baltic States could feel equally\nconfident. The time is ripe for action. The rapid preparation\nof an international agreement is in the interests of both sides.\nWhen two years of negotiations conducted between a great\nPower and a small State remain unproductive, it is a sign of\ndanger. Preventive diplomacy consists in the ability to\nrecognize danger signals at an early stage and resolve them\nin a lightning-rod fashion. This is our first problem and our\nprimary task.\nAt different stages, two different arguments were used\nin stalling and detouring the negotiations. First, the Russian\nside claimed it would be unable to find housing for forces\nwithdrawn from the Baltic States. From a legal standpoint,\nthis argument lacks any content whatsoever. The stationing\nof foreign forces on the territory of a sovereign State against\nthe express will of that State and its people is in\ncontradiction with international law and cannot be an item\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 3\nfor negotiation. At the same time, I would like to repeat\nagain that Estonia is ready, together with its Nordic\nneighbours and other partners, and to the extent that its\nresources permit, to assist in the solution of this essentially\nhumanitarian problem. We are grateful to our friends, who\nhave promised housing construction aid in excess of\n$200 million, and we are prepared, with the help of these\npartners, to mobilize our construction industry towards this\nend. We have on several occasions publicly repeated and\nconfirmed this readiness to our Russian partner.\nThe second argument for the maintenance of foreign\narmed forces and their installation on the territory of the\nBaltic States is in a curious way linked to human rights.\nAccording to this line of thinking, which has been\npromulgated primarily in the Western media, the continued\npresence of ex-Soviet armed forces in the Baltic States is\nrequired for the defence of the human rights of the Russians\nresiding there. However, the Russian residents of Estonia\nhave never supported this argument, since they have not\nwished to become pawns in a political game.\nIn this connection, I should like to take the opportunity\nto thank you, Mr. President, and you, Mr. Secretary-\nGeneral, for the assistance of the United Nations. The\nRepublic of Estonia had already enunciated, during the time\nof the League of Nations, and now it does so even more\nclearly, the basic principle that human rights are not the\n\\\"internal affair\\\" of any State. For this reason, on the\nquestion of human rights in Estonia we turned for expert\nopinions and advice not only to the United Nations, but also\nto the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nthe Council of Europe and the Nordic Council. Thus, I can\nconfirm that not one of the 15 missions invited by Estonia\nto inspect the situation firsthand has found human rights\nviolations in Estonia. This has also been emphasized by\nmany speakers during this General Assembly session. It was\nalso, I am happy to note, emphasized by President Clinton\nin our recent meeting.\nI am disappointed that the idea of human rights -\nwhich, for Estonia, is self-evident and sacrosanct, and for the\nlack of which Estonians themselves, during five decades of\nCommunist totalitarianism, had to pay with the loss of their\npride, their freedom and their blood in Soviet and Nazi\nconcentration camps - has been cynically\nexploited. The Republic of Estonia was the first State in the\nworld to guarantee Jews and other minorities, as early as\n1925, the right to cultural autonomy. Estonia will never\nstand idly by while anyone tries to manipulate human rights.\nFor this reason, Estonia supports the creation of the post of\na United Nations high commissioner for human rights and\nthe expansion of the United Nations budget earmarked for\nthe defence of human rights.\nWe wish to work to defend the human rights of all\nindigenous peoples. We defended the rights of some\nSiberian peoples during the decades of Soviet totalitarianism,\nalthough we had to do it alone and quietly. Now we intend\nto join forces and to do it, with the help of the United\nNations, publicly.\nI like to speak of the future in optimistic terms on the\nassumption that we are capable of finding resolutions to our\npessimistic present, or to be more precise, that we are\ncapable of applying these resolutions, since they are already\noutlined in Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u2019s report \\\"An Agenda\nfor Peace\\\" (A/47/277). Allow me, Mr. Secretary- General,\nto thank you wholeheartedly for the clear analysis and sober\nrecommendations on the implementation of such key\nconcepts as preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\npeace-keeping. The tragedy in Yugoslavia has reconfirmed\nthe fact that fire-fighting is much more difficult than\nfire-prevention. This lesson, which is written in the Torah,\nthe Bible and the Koran, is, thanks to the Secretary- General,\nnow slowly penetrating the consciousness of international\norganizations. Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\npeace-keeping can be a real hope for the United Nations on\nthe condition that we learn to recognize danger, where and\nwhen it becomes manifest.\nHowever, in a potential zone of conflict, peace-keeping\nmust be strictly neutral. We must remember the proverb\nthat \\\"You should not let a fox mind the henhouse\\\", that\npeace-keeping in a particular area cannot be turned over to\nthose parties that have an obvious interest in the outcome of\na conflict. Estonia supports the principles of democracy, the\ninviolability of borders and non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other countries, principles enshrined in the United\nNations Charter and in other international agreements.\nConsequently, we were disturbed - as, I am sure, many\nrepresentatives were - by the suggestion of one national\nrepresentative that the troops of one country should be\nallowed to intervene up to the borders of a State that no\nlonger exists. I do not have in mind the former\nAustro-Hungarian Empire.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nEstonia can only support a position whereby the choice\nof peace-keeping forces by the Security Council meets the\napproval of broad international opinion. On this condition,\nEstonia also feels a moral responsibility to participate in\ninternational peace-keeping according to its capabilities, as\nwell as in other related activities.\nThis brings me to the consolidation of democracy and\nthe free market economy in Estonia after 50 years of an\nabsurd colonial command economy. Estonia has already\nbeen successful, but, together with other Members of the\nOrganization, we could be even more successful.\nDemocracy and the free market economy are interconnected,\nbecause they presuppose the right and the responsibility to\nfreely choose. The former Soviet Union spent more money\non repressing free thought than it ever did on the creation of\na nuclear arsenal. The murder of freedom and the birth of\naggression are two sides of the same coin. The first enemy\nof every totalitarian regime is the domestic enemy, and its\nfirst object of attack is free thought. Everyone present\nknows Adam Michnik\u2019s wonderful metaphor about how easy\nit is to make fish soup from an aquarium, but how difficult\nit is to make an aquarium from fish soup.\nThe main resource from which we have drawn the\nenergy for the transformation of Estonia\u2019s economy has been\nthe idealism of the Estonian people. This is a large\nresource, but it is not endless. I want to prevent exhaustion\nfrom setting in, exhaustion which could be followed by\npolitical apathy and thereby by a desire to be free both of\nrights and obligations. The replacement of a command\neconomy by a market economy is a disintegrative process\nboth at the State and individual level as long as the market\nhas not started working. Once the market is working, it\nworks for economic and political integration. Therefore,\nEstonia is more interested in trade, not aid, and therefore we\nwork actively to keep and expand our free trade agreements\nthrough negotiations with Brussels.\nMy aim has been to suggest that the international\ncommunity has gained new members - the countries in\ntransition. Here the question arises whether the United\nNations has realized our special possibilities and our special\nneeds. Estonia does not belong in either the first, second or\nthird world. Do we really need a fourth world, or do we\nneed the ability to react more sensitively to a world which\nis in constant dynamic change?\nI offer as an example an issue that is as unpleasant to\nthe Assembly as it is to me: the division by 15 of the\nfinancial commitments of the former Soviet Union, including\nits United Nations assessment. Estonia has stated repeatedly,\nand I do not hesitate to state here again, that we cannot and\nwe will not accept this, as we were never legally part of the\nSoviet Union. Times have changed; our world community\nmust realize this.\nWe also feel a responsibility to assist others as we have\nbeen assisted during the past few years. While Estonia is\nstill reeling from the disastrous consequences of a 50-year\noccupation, we do have well-educated specialists who could\nbe of service to the United Nations in parts of the world\nwhere their skills would be welcome. And I should like to\noffer the experience we have gained in starting up a country\nand in creating a new, stable currency.\nAllow me to close with some very personal comments.\nThe United Nations is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.\nThe post-war world is approaching its fiftieth anniversary.\nThe United Nations is acting on the basis of an unaltered\nCharter. But, as I mentioned above, the world has been\naltered totally. This ever-increasing contrast is most strongly\nfelt by some of the most sensitive United Nations Members,\nthe majority, the small States. I believe that small States\nhave the obligation to redefine the international order. The\nlarge nations have the larger obligations, the small States the\nlarger possibilities. This is not a contradiction, but a\nbalance. After all, an Inuit kayak can change its course\nimmediately, while a supertanker needs perilously much time\nand space to do so.\nThe best place to redefine the world order is the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I am deeply\ngrateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who,\nsensing this need, has entrusted into our hands his vision of\na stable world, entitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\". As a\nrepresentative of one of Europe\u2019s smallest countries and\noldest nations, I should like to suggest that the prevalent\ntendency of the past century, and especially the past decades,\nhas been an increase in the numbers of small countries and\na reduction in the number of large ones. The issue of\nincreasing the number of permanent members of the Security\nCouncil has been introduced into the agenda, and Estonia\nsupports this as a step towards accepting today\u2019s new\nrealities. Personally, I should like to put to you, members\nof the General Assembly, the following question: should the\nSecurity Council not also include as a member with veto\npower a representative of the world\u2019s majority, the small\nnations?\nI do not have an answer to this question and neither do\nyou. This is not tragic. The opposite would be tragic.\nSeeking for answers is the United Nations future and our\ncommon hope. Today we speak of the fatal differences\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 5\nbetween cultures. Thereby the inevitability of conflicts is\nsuggested.\nConflicts are not fatal only because someone believes\nin Buddha, another in Jehovah, another in Christ or Allah or\nthe shamans of Siberia. Cultures have to be different to\nallow man, with his rights and duties, to look like man, to\nlook like hope. The day before coming here I read a book\nby the famous Finnish philosopher Matti Kuusi on what\nhope means to man. The Mexican says that you cannot fill\nyour stomach with hope, but it will keep the soul in your\nmouth; a Kanuri African will say that hope is the pillar; the\nFilipino says that daring is the fruit of hope and the Maltese\nsays that he who gives up hope dies.\nThis diversity is the unity of mankind. And to make it\neasier for you to keep the unity of man and the world, I will\nadd for salt, pepper and enjoyment a proverb from my\nshores, the shores of the Baltic: do not lose your\nhopelessness. Hopelessness is the inevitable shadow of\nhope, and the ever-persevering United Nations is the\ncollective hope of mankind.\nI thank you for your hopeful patience.\n"

His diplomatic skills\nand wide experience, particularly in the United Nations, will\nbe a valuable asset for the success of this important session\nof the Assembly.\nWe express our appreciation and gratitude also to the\nprevious President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his memorable\ncontribution in guiding the forty-seventh session of the\nAssembly.\nA special tribute is due to the Secretary-General of our\norganization, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his dedication\nand dynamism. We agree with the Secretary-General that\npeace, development and democracy are interlinked and that\n\\\"Cooperative global integration is now an inescapable\nfact and requirement for all the world\u2019s peoples.\\\"\n(A/48/1, para. 13)\nPakistan is happy to welcome the Czech Republic,\nSlovakia, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav Republic of\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 13\nMacedonia, the Principality of Monaco and the Principality\nof Andorra as Members of our Organization. We look\nforward to close cooperation with them in efforts to\naccomplish the aims of the United Nations.\nTo that objective, and to the noble vision of the\nCharter, Pakistan has been committed ever since its\nindependence. We have throughout sought to abide by its\nprinciples, and we reaffirm our faith in their timeless\nvalidity. As in the past, so also in the future Pakistan will\nextend its wholehearted cooperation to all other States in\ncommon efforts aimed at realizing the ideals that inspired\nthe establishment of the United Nations.\nNearly half a century later retrospection evokes mixed\nfeelings. The Organization\u2019s failures and acts of omission\nhaunt and depress; yet Members of the United Nations have\nmuch to celebrate. Some of the achievements during these\ndecades have been monumental.\nOver 130 nations have emerged from the dark era of\ncolonialism and alien domination, each bringing its unique\ngenius to enrich world civilization, and to advance the cause\nof human dignity.\nThe nightmare of a nuclear Armageddon has been\naverted. Weapons of mass destruction are being reduced.\nIdeological rivalry and confrontation have yielded to peace\nand cooperation.\nDemocracy continues to triumph. People in large parts\nof the world have achieved economic and social progress,\nand better standards of living in peace and freedom.\nIn moments of optimism, we even perceive the glimmer\nof a new dawn, of a more equitable and tranquil era, when\npower will have been civilized, when differences and\ndisputes between States will be resolved, not through\naggression or intimidation, but by peaceful means on the\nbasis of law and justice, as they are between individuals.\nThat vision appears tantalizingly close, yet it eludes our\ngrasp. The world community\u2019s progress towards peace and\nprosperity is both slow and meandering. We have witnessed\nmany setbacks and reverses. At such times the vision of\npeace seems to recede to the far horizon.\nRespect for fundamental rights has been severely\nundermined. Some States have exhibited blatant disregard\nand contempt for international norms, allowing and even\nencouraging their forces to perpetrate barbarous acts that\noutrage the conscience of decent people.\nInstead of civility and the practice of tolerance being\npromoted, chauvinism and the evils of bigotry and hatred are\nencouraged in some countries. The consequence has been\npogroms against minorities and destruction and desecration\nof their places of worship.\nThe number of people in the world who have been\nforced to flee their homes as refugees has risen to a record\nlevel, straining the resources available for their relief.\nThe problem of poverty has intensified. A billion\npeople live in penury, without adequate food and shelter.\nFor them, life is short and brutish.\nManifestly, the United Nations has a long road to\ntravel, and many old and new obstacles to overcome, before\nit fulfills the aims and purposes set for it in the Charter. But\neven as we count the multifarious challenges, we can draw\nsome solace from recent successes.\nA remarkable transition has taken place in Cambodia,\na transition in which the United Nations Transitional\nAuthority in Cambodia (UNTAC) played a pivotal role. The\ncommendable contribution of the Secretary General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, and his collaborators,\nis a source of satisfaction for the Organization and its\nmembers. Committed to the promotion of peace and\nstability, Pakistan is happy to have provided 1,500 personnel\nfor UNTAC during the transition.\nThe Declaration of Principles signed by the Palestine\nLiberation Organization and Israel is a positive development.\nImplemented in good faith, it could go down in history as an\nimportant first step towards peace and coexistence in the\nMiddle East. Vital to the realization of that aim will be\nrespect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and\nan equitable settlement of the outstanding issues. The status\nof Al-Quds-el-Sharif remains a crucial issue of interest to us\nin Pakistan and, indeed, to Muslims all over the world.\nWe hope that the Declaration, evolved with the\ncommendable contribution of Norway, and the agenda\nagreed between Jordan and Israel will give a fillip to the\nnegotiations for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\nfor which Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973) provide an agreed and necessary basis.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn Afghanistan the accommodation achieved by the\nmujahidin leaders, and the formation of a coalition\ngovernment, is reason for satisfaction. Consolidation of\npeace will allow the Afghan people to enjoy the fruits of\ntheir epic victory. Meanwhile, a programme for the\nreconstruction of this war-ravaged country needs to be\nlaunched immediately. By providing employment, it will\nreinforce the peace process. Pakistan is prepared to join in\ninternational efforts for the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\nAssistance is needed also for the million and a half Afghan\nrefugees in Pakistan who are still unable to return to their\nhomeland, pending the creation of conducive economic and\npolitical conditions.\nThe political evolution in South Africa holds the\nwelcome promise of peace and freedom for all its people.\nThey and the world at large applaud the valiant freedom\nfighter and statesman, Nelson Mandela, for his sagacious\nleadership. Pakistan will respond positively to his proposals\nto bring South Africa back into the comity of nations. The\nformation of a pluralist, democratic Government is in sight.\nPakistan looks forward to developing close and friendly\nrelations with the new South Africa.\nIn Somalia, too, notable progress has been made\ntowards the restoration of law and order and the\nrehabilitation of its polity, though, regrettably, the process\nhas been slow and painful. We in Pakistan are deeply\ngrieved because our troops have suffered heavy casualties on\naccount of the misguided acts of a Somali faction. Yet\nPakistan will not abandon the United Nations Mission. Our\ncontingent will continue to hold high the United Nations\nflag, assist relief operations and promote the re-establishment\nof peace and harmony in Somalia, for whose people we\ncherish abiding goodwill and fraternal affection.\nWe welcome the progress achieved in Mozambique,\nLiberia and Rwanda, and hope that the relevant agreements\nwill be implemented in letter and in spirit. The unfortunate\ndevelopments in Angola must be reversed. We urge the\nparties concerned to seek dialogue and national\nreconciliation. The international community must assist\nthese countries in restoring peace and normalcy.\nThe optimism generated by the end of the cold war has\nbeen blighted by the colossal tragedy in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. A member of the United Nations has been\ncarved up by the use of force and its people brutalized\nthrough aggression and cold-blooded genocide. Crimes\nagainst humanity have been perpetrated on a scale not seen\nsince the Holocaust. The conscience of mankind has been\noutraged. Yet the community of States failed to act in\ndefence of a small State. It has succeeded, instead, in\ndenying the inherent right of a State to self-defence. Indeed,\nsome of the members of the Security Council even\nobstructed moves to assist the victims of aggression and\nslaughter, knowing full well that the perpetrators of\naggression were being aided and abetted by their ethnic\nneighbours.\nWith their hands tied behind their backs, the Bosnians\nhave been forced to negotiate a so-called agreement. They\nhave been obliged to submit to a diktat in disregard of equity\nand even the resolutions of the Security Council. A plan\nthat would reward aggression and legalize acquisition of\nterritory by force cannot, and should not, win the\napprobation of the world community.\nThe General Assembly can still act, even at this\neleventh hour, to salvage the hope that has been invested by\nthe people of the world in the United Nations. Its voice\nmust rise in defence of law and justice, in order to preserve\nthe sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina; to ensure an\nequitable apportionment of territory among its different\nethnic components; to strengthen the United Nations force so\nthat it can keep and enforce the peace; to protect the safe\nareas to provide relief against hunger and the rigour of the\napproaching winter; and to punish those responsible for the\nbestial crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nAzerbaijan is yet another victim of aggression.\nArmenians have occupied Azeri territory and expelled\nhundreds of thousands of people from their homes. We call\nfor an end to this aggression and for the withdrawal of\nArmenian forces. Also, the Azeri refugees need the\nassistance of the world community for the relief of their\nsuffering.\nThe crisis in Kashmir calls for urgent action by the\nUnited Nations. India has unleashed a brutal reign of terror\nand repression in the occupied State in an unconscionable\nattempt to bludgeon the Kashmiri people into submission and\nto thwart their legitimate struggle for the realization of their\nright to decide their own future. This is, of course, an\ninherent right, but in the case of Kashmir it has been\nspecifically pledged to them by Pakistan, by India and by the\nUnited Nations. It is sanctified in the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council pertaining to Kashmir.\nInternationally respected non-governmental human\nrights organizations have graphically documented the brutal\ncrimes committed by the Indian occupation forces.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 15\nSince 1990 Amnesty International has been reporting on\nthe massive violations of human rights in Kashmir by Indian\nforces, on the practice of arbitrary imprisonment, torture and\nkillings of Kashmiris in custody, and on the perpetration of\nrape as a matter of policy.\n\\\"Rape is not uncommon and there is evidence of its\nemployment as an instrument of terror\\\", says\nP. M. Vandarajan, a University of Oxford lecturer, who\nvisited Kashmir in September 1992. In his report,\npublished by the International Federation of Human\nRights, Paris, the author recalls:\n\\\"The infamous mass rape by the Indian Army at\nKunan Poshpora was reported widely in the press, both\nin India and abroad. It is, to date, the most sickening\nexample by far of the brutal excesses of the Security\nForces against the women of the region\\\".\nIt is the most sickening, but it is by no means a solitary\nincident.\nAlso catalogued in the report are cases of\n\\\"disappearances\\\" of people, and of young men who \\\"are\ntortured in Kashmir every day\\\", and of extra-judicial, or\nillegal, executions, which \\\"are alarmingly frequent\\\".\nThe very titles of the reports issued by international\nhuman rights organizations and by reputable journals depict\nthe grave conditions in Kashmir. Headlines and titles of\nreports issued during 1993 include: \\\"Heaven on Fire\\\", a\nreport by Tim Gopsill on behalf of the British Parliamentary\nGroup; \\\"India\u2019s Shame\\\", a London Sunday newspaper, 17\nJanuary 1993; \\\"The crackdown in Kashmir - Torture of\nDetainees and Assaults on the Medical Community\\\", Asia\nWatch and Physicians for Human Rights; \\\"Extra-Judicial\nExecutions, Rape, Arbitrary Arrests, Disappearances and\nother violations of Basic Human Rights by the Indian\nSecurity Forces in Indian-administered Kashmir\\\", a report by\nthe International Federation of Lawyers for Human Rights;\n\\\"Violations of human rights committed by the Indian\nsecurity forces in Jammu and Kashmir\\\", by the same\nOrganization; \\\"Rape in Kashmir: A Crime of War\\\", by Asia\nWatch and Physicians for Human Rights.\nThe report by Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights\nWatch, New York and Washington, and Physicians for\nHuman Rights, Boston, released in June 1993, concludes:\n\\\"In their efforts to crush the militant separatist\nmovement in Kashmir, Indian government forces have\nsystematically violated international human rights and\nhumanitarian law. Among the worst of these violations\nhave been the summary executions of hundreds of\ndetainees in the custody of the security forces in\nKashmir. Such killings are carried out as a matter of\npolicy ...\n\\\"Methods of torture include severe beatings,\nelectric shock, suspension by the feet or hands,\nstretching the legs apart, burning with heated objects,\nsexual molestation and psychological deprivation and\nhumiliation. One common form of torture involves\ncrushing the leg muscles with a heavy wooden roller ...\nTens of thousands of Kashmiris have been killed by\nIndian forces in the nearly four years since India began the\nbrutal repression in January 1990. Many more have been\nmaimed and incapacitated.\nNo statistics can illustrate the agony of a people or\nportray their anguish and pain. But they do illustrate the\niron resolve of the people to recover their birthright. Now,\nin the fourth year, the Kashmiri struggle continues to gather\ninternal strength. It has been established beyond doubt that\nthe Kashmiri people have not acquiesced and will not\nacquiesce in Indian occupation. They have not accepted and\nwill not accept Indian rule.\nIndia\u2019s position on the Kashmir question, and its policy\nin the occupied territory, constitute a fundamental defiance\nof international law and morality. India claims that Jammu\nand Kashmir is part of India; this claim is legally and\nhistorically baseless. The future of the State remains to be\ndetermined. The resolutions of the Security Council on this\nquestion, providing for a plebiscite to decide the accession\nof the State to India or Pakistan, have yet to be\nimplemented. A member of the United Nations cannot be\nallowed to refuse to implement a resolution of the Security\nCouncil. The resolutions in question were, moreover,\naccepted by Pakistan as well as India. Law does not permit\na party to unilaterally renounce an international agreement.\nThe struggle of the Kashmiri people to recover their\nfreedom of choice is a righteous struggle for a fundamental\nright. It merits the support of all members of the United\nNations. For Pakistan, a party to the dispute, such support\nis a matter of duty as well as right. The Government and\npeople of Pakistan remain steadfast in their adherence to the\nSecurity Council resolutions and in our strong support for\nthe Kashmiri right to self-determination. Pakistan calls upon\nIndia to fulfil its obligations under law. We request all other\nmembers of the United Nations to take appropriate action to\nhalt the Indian violations of human rights in Kashmir and to\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nensure the implementation of the Security Council\nresolutions.\nRecent reports testify to an alarming escalation in\nhuman rights abuses by the Indian forces in Kashmir. In\norder to investigate this human rights emergency, we\naddressed a letter to the President of the Security Council\nlast week and reiterated our suggestion that a fact-finding\nmission be dispatched to Jammu and Kashmir. If India has\nnothing to conceal, it should accept our suggestion.\nAlong with the resolution of conflicts, disarmament\noffers a real option for States, large and small, to enhance\ntheir security and expand the frontiers of regional and global\npeace. The end of the cold war has removed the threat of\nnuclear Armageddon. We welcome the agreements on the\nreduction of strategic arms. Even so, thousands of nuclear\nweapons will remain in the arsenals of the nuclear-weapon\nStates. We hope they will act to further reduce and\neventually eliminate all nuclear weapons. The Geneva\nConference on Disarmament should renew its work on a\nprogramme for nuclear disarmament to be achieved within\na specific time-frame.\nUntil nuclear disarmament is realized, the non-nuclear-\nweapon States have the right to be assured by the nuclear-\nweapon States that there will be no use or threat of the use\nof nuclear weapons. The disappearance of the rival military\nblocs which relied on nuclear deterrence for security against\neach other should make it possible for the nuclear Powers to\nundertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons\nagainst non-nuclear States.\nFor over 20 years Pakistan has advocated the\nconclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We\nare therefore happy that negotiations are to open in Geneva\nfor the conclusion of such a treaty. Pakistan will participate\nactively in this endeavour. We have also consistently\nsupported a global ban on the production of fissile material\nwhich should be realized on a non-discriminatory basis.\nThe regional approach has proved to be an effective\navenue to promote nuclear non-proliferation. The concept of\nnuclear-weapon-free zones is finally being translated into\nreality. The Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone came\ninto force this year. Mutual arrangements for\nnon-proliferation have also been worked out by Brazil and\nArgentina. The dramatic reversal in South Africa\u2019s nuclear\nweapons programme has created the conditions for\nestablishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. In the\nMiddle East, too, the progress towards peace may create\npolitical momentum for non-proliferation.\nUnfortunately, the hopes for non-proliferation in South\nAsia received a serious setback when India exploded a\nnuclear bomb in 1974. Nevertheless, Pakistan has continued\nto advocate efforts to eliminate the danger of proliferation in\nSouth Asia. To that end, we have put forward several\nproposals. These include a South Asia nuclear-weapon-free\nzone; the simultaneous signature of the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by India and\nPakistan; mutual verification by these countries of each\nother\u2019s nuclear facilities; a bilateral nuclear-test-ban treaty;\na conference with the participation of India, Pakistan, the\nUnited States, Russia and China to elaborate\nnon-proliferation and security arrangements in our region.\nRegrettably, these proposals have not yet been accepted.\nConventional disarmament can also be promoted most\neffectively in the regional context. The Geneva Conference\non Disarmament should elaborate principles to promote such\nregional arms control and disarmament in the conventional\nfield. The United Nations arms transfer Register has proved\nto be a successful experiment. Pakistan has provided the\nrequired information on its arms acquisition and sales.\nHowever, this Register may not provide a complete picture\nof the dangers to peace in various regions. It is only when\nboth the transfer and the indigenous production of\narmaments are taken into account that a comprehensive\nevaluation of arms balances or imbalances can be made.\nTo promote peace and prosperity, it is essential to\nfacilitate rather than restrain the application of modern\ntechnology for economic and social development. The\nUnited Nations should consider preparing a comprehensive\nstudy of the impediments placed arbitrarily in the way of the\napplication of advanced technology for the promotion of\neconomic and social development in the developing\ncountries.\nThe global recession of the past few years has brought\nsevere hardship to many of the poorest countries and\nespecially to the poorest within these countries. The\ngrowing number of people living in absolute poverty\nthreatens political stability in many developing countries. A\ncomprehensive programme for development should be\naccorded high priority by the world community.\nThe forces of protectionism must be resisted. The\nUruguay Round must be concluded by the end of 1993.\nAdequate official resources should be channelled to those\ndeveloping countries which are implementing far-reaching\neconomic reform and liberalization measures. The desperate\nneeds of Africa require urgent attention. A new flow of\nofficial assistance should be directed in particular to the\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 17\neradication of poverty, to human and social development\nprogrammes and to sustainable growth in the developing\ncountries.\nThe developing countries need urgently to address the\ninexorable and unsustainable growth in their populations.\nWe greatly appreciate the dedication and efforts of Mr. Nafis\nSadik, the indefatigable head of the United Nations\nPopulation Fund. We hope the forthcoming population\nConference in Cairo will devise a comprehensive long-term\nstrategy to meet the challenge of burgeoning populations. At\nthe same time, the needs of the world\u2019s children must\nassume priority on national and international agendas.\nWith the collapse of the Iron Curtain, there are now no\npolitical or ideological obstacles in the way of creating a\ntruly global economy based on the principles of the market.\nWe hope that regional economic groupings will produce a\nmomentum towards global economic interaction and\nintegration, and not the reverse. Pakistan stands at the\ncrossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and the\nGulf, and can serve as a link for mutually beneficial\neconomic, commercial and industrial cooperation between\nthese adjacent regions.\nThe United Nations is the only forum where the nations\nof the world can concert their policies to construct the new\nstructures for global peace and progress. The Secretary\nGeneral has pointed in the right direction in his report\nentitled \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nIt is essential to strengthen the mechanisms for\ndispute-settlement and the resolution of conflicts provided\nfor in the Charter of the United Nations. At the same time,\nthe Security Council must exhibit a more uniform and\nconsistent resolve to implement its own decisions and\nresolutions. Only thus can the goal of collective security\nbecome a living reality.\nPakistan agrees that an appropriate enlargement of the\nmembership of the Security Council is required to enhance\nits representative character. Its procedures should also be\nmade more transparent. The guiding principles for reform\nmust be democracy and the sovereign equality of Member\nStates. We cannot contemplate according privileged status\nto those countries which have a record of defying the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and refusing to\nimplement the resolutions of the Security Council.\nThe demands made on the United Nations for\npeace-keeping and peacemaking have increased significantly.\nToday there are 80,000 United Nations peace-keepers\nengaged in some 17 operations. Their missions are often\ndifficult and dangerous. Yet the Members of the United\nNations have to accept the risks and assist States and\ncommunities threatened by more powerful neighbours and\nadversaries. Pakistan is among the largest contributors to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, with more than\n6,000 personnel committed to United Nations operations at\npresent.\nIf the United Nations is to discharge its growing\nresponsibilities, it must be assured of stable and adequate\nresources to finance its activities. The cost of alternatives\nwould be immensely higher.\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly\nshould mark a watershed - a transition from the habits of the\ncold war to an endeavour to construct peace and universal\nprosperity in a new multipolar era. To succeed in this\nendeavour, we shall need to arrest the dangerous\nproliferation of national and ethnic conflicts and disputes;\nestablish the supremacy of human rights, democracy and\nfreedom; prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction and move towards nuclear and conventional\ndisarmament, and arrest the forces of trade protectionism and\nmercantilism to foster global and sustainable development.\nThe challenges that the Member States of the United\nNations confront are imposing indeed. Yet, the opportunities\nfor genuine peace and universal prosperity are also most\npromising. With goodwill and cooperation, Member States\ncan make significant progress at this session towards the\nvision of peace, progress and human solidarity envisaged in\nthe Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "At\nthe outset, I should like, on behalf of the Government and\npeople of Mali, to convey to the people of India our\nprofound grief at the heavy loss of life and the massive\nmaterial damage caused by the earthquake that has just\nstruck their country.\nI have pleasure in expressing to Mr. Insanally the\nheartfelt and cordial congratulations of the delegation of\nMali on his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I wish him every\nsuccess and assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest\ncooperation.\nLet me take this opportunity also to express our\nsatisfaction at the exemplary manner in which Mr. Stoyan\nGanev presided over the Assembly\u2019s work at the last session.\nIt is also a pleasure to congratulate the United Nations\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the\nconstant efforts he has made since he became head of the\nOrganization.\nThe United Nations now consists of 184 Member\nStates. This confirms its universality, gives it further\ncredibility and explains the renewed interest in seeing it\nfulfil its promise. Our warmest congratulations go to all the\nnew Members. We assure them of our full readiness to\ncooperate with them.\nThe world is most certainly living through times of\ngreat change. Ever since the events of 26 March 1991, Mali\nhas been resolutely embarked on a process of\ndemocratization. However, this process is unfolding in\nespecially trying circumstances.\nIn strictly national terms, the transition to democracy,\nwhich was achieved through the elections of 1992, though\nessentially a success, is being prolonged by new\n44 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nuncertainties. With regard to social values, one finds a\nserious identity crisis and a lack of orientation among the\nyoung, in the workplace and among the traditional players in\nthe private-sector economy. There is uncertainty also about\nthe way in which the new political institutions operate, as\nthese need to go through a period of apprenticeship in a\ndemocratic context, where impatience and violence coexist\nwith a readiness for dialogue and for solidarity. Uncertainty\nis to be found also with regard to the new mission, size,\noperation and performance of an administration in transition,\nwhich must be more transparent and accessible to people at\nthe grass roots. Uncertainty is to found, finally, in economic\ndevelopment programmes characterized by the urgent need\nfor in-depth structural adjustment and the need to reallocate\npublic resources to satisfy priority necessities: a basic\neducation, public health provision, village water supplies and\nmaintenance of the infrastructure.\nAt the subregional level, which for Mali encompasses\nboth western Africa south of the Sahara and the Arab\nMaghreb, we are dealing with such complex and difficult\nproblems as instability borne of local conflicts, followed by\nhuman tragedy, because the number of refugees in the\nsubregion has risen from approximately 20,000 in 1989 to\nmore than 1.2 million in 1993; the slow pace of economic\nintegration, despite all the very vocal declarations of\ngoodwill, which is restricting growth in the subregion; and\nreligious questions which are daily gaining more ground and\nsubjecting political institutions to new trials that are more\ndelicate, more difficult to define and cope with and more\nterrible.\nThe Government of Mali believes that to cope\neffectively and efficiently with those problems and the many\nchallenges in the process of democratization, we will have\nquickly to restore economic growth and then develop human\nresources, the true way to a successful future, achieve\nmedium-term and long-term stability and thus find the\neconomic key to development. Finally, we shall have to\nguarantee balanced development and comprehensive\nfinancing for development.\nIn all this, our Government does not forget and, indeed,\nit is meeting its international obligations as well.\nBy the same token, we continue to advocate and to\nwork internationally for a world of peace and concord where\nit should be possible to find a solution to all problems by\ndialogue and negotiation.\nThis courageous political evolution should be strongly\nsupported because the adverse impact of a disadvantageous\neconomic situation, along with drastic structural adjustment\nmeasures and problems linked to debt, compounded by\nsocio-political tension, is having an adverse impact on the\nentire democratic process.\nThe international environment in which this session is\nbeing held is marked by many uncertainties linked to the life\nof the Organization and of the international community in\ngeneral. The post-war period saw the emergence of new\ndemocracies and the strengthening of protection for human\nrights the world over.\nOver the past three years the Organization has taken on\na number of commitments. In terms of peace-keeping, the\ndeclaration made on 31 January 1992 at the Summit of the\nHeads of State or Government of the member States of the\nSecurity Council, set milestones to be reached in establishing\na new international order.\nWhile remaining committed to the quest for\ninternational peace and security, we believe that any peacekeeping operation must come within a precise framework\ndefined by the Security Council. Any loss of control may\njeopardize the very credibility of the Organization.\nNotwithstanding the Organization\u2019s efforts in the search\nfor international peace and security, hotbeds of tension, alas,\npersist around the world.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina inter-ethnic confrontation\nand clashes have reached unimaginable proportions. The\ninternational community seems, paradoxically, to be\nwatching passively the breakup of a country upon\nexclusively ethnic and religious grounds. That is setting\nalarming precedents.\nIn Angola, despite the many efforts by the United\nNations, the situation remains alarming. My delegation\nappeals to all the parties to commit themselves more\nintensively to seeking a just and lasting resolution of this\nconflict.\nThe situation prevailing in Somalia is a threat to peace\nand security in that region. The presence of the United\nNations, through the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM II), should in principle hold out the promise of\nbringing peace to the country and a negotiated political\nresolution of the crisis. Humanitarian aid has made it\npossible to avoid irreparable damage being done, but we\nbelieve that UNOSOM II must attempt to silence the guns\nand create a climate favourable to reconciliation among all\nSomalis.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 45\nWhilst areas of serious tension persist, we would do\nwell to welcome the positive turn of events in the settlement\nof other conflicts.\nIn Liberia hope has been rekindled, with the recent\nsigning of the Cotonou Agreement, the entry into force of\nthe cease-fire and the setting up of the high Council of State.\nThe expansion of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) Military Observer\nGroup (ECOMOG) and greater involvement by the United\nNations in implementing the agreement might lead to the\nrebirth of the Liberian State. This is the time and place to\nappeal to the international community immediately to create\nsupport funds and to implement the Cotonou Agreement.\nIn Mozambique the acceptance of a new timetable to\nimplement the Peace Agreements will promote the\nimplementation of the United Nations Operation in\nMozambique (ONUMOZ). We pay tribute to the parties for\nrespecting the cease-fire.\nAs to the conflict in Rwanda, we are reassured by the\nsense of responsibility being displayed by the Government\nand the Rwanda Patriotic Front. The signature in Arusha on\n4 August last of an agreement between the two parties\nproves that a political settlement of a conflict is always\npossible if all sides have the will. We therefore welcome\nthis determination of the parties concerned and encourage\nthem to pursue dialogue and strictly and scrupulously to\nimplement the requirements of the Agreement in observing\nthe cease-fire. The United Nations and the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) should strive, for their part, to\nconsolidate this major achievement.\nIn South Africa the multiracial negotiations will\ncertainly see the advent of a democratic, non-racial and\nunited South Africa. The United Nations must pursue its\ncooperation with the Organization of African Unity to\nsupport the process. However, the Government in place\nmust take forceful measures to put an end to the wave of\nviolence sweeping the country. The insecurity is fertile\nground for anarchy and disorder.\nWe welcome the turn events have taken in the\nreferendum process under way in Western Sahara with the\ncooperation of all parties. The joint efforts of the United\nNations and the Organization of African Unity to bring about\na negotiated settlement can, we are convinced, succeed if the\nparties directly concerned continue their cooperation. It is\ntherefore necessary for their decision-making bodies to work\nclosely with the United Nations Identification Commission\nto resolve the last remaining obstacles linked to criteria for\nidentifying electors and establishing proof of identity. My\ndelegation reaffirms its support for the process.\nMali has been following with keen interest the latest\ndevelopments on the question of Palestine. The mutual\nrecognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\nand the State of Israel, followed by the signing of a\ndeclaration of principles on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza\nand Jericho, mark a major step towards a just and lasting\nsettlement of the question of Palestine and the establishment\nof relations of trust between the peoples of that region.\nMy delegation hails the Israeli-Palestinian\nrapprochement, fruit of the courage and political realism of\nthe leaders of both parties and the praiseworthy efforts\naround the world to make the negotiations a success. We\ninvite all the parties concerned to give tangible expression to\nthis remarkable spirit so as to bring about a definitive peace\nin the Middle East in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions.\nIn Haiti the signing of the Governors Island Agreement\nand the New York Pact should soon make it possible for the\nlegitimate President of that country to return. We hail the\nsteps taken by the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy,\nwhich have made it possible to attain the results achieved so\nfar.\nElsewhere - in Cambodia, Afghanistan and El Salvador\n- we praise the efforts to bring about progressive\nnormalization.\nWith regard to the dispute pitting Libya against certain\nother Member States, the Government of Mali reaffirms its\nsupport for implementation of Security Council resolutions\n731 (1992) and 748 (1992). We condemn terrorism in all its\nforms. In supporting the resolutions adopted in this context\nby the Organization of African Unity, the Arab Maghreb\nUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference,\namong others, the Government of Mali hopes for continued\nnegotiation and action from the Secretary-General. A just\nand equitable resolution of this crisis and a rapid lifting of\nthe embargo would contribute to creating a climate of peace\nand security in the subregion and to removing a major factor\npreventing the economic development of the peoples\nconcerned.\nAs to the Korean peninsula, my delegation encourages\nthe pursuit of the negotiation process set in train and\nstrongly hopes that it will lead to the peaceful reunification\nof the two Koreas.\n46 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nI now revert to development issues of particular\nimportance to the African continent: the situation of the\nleast developed countries; the problems of children and\nwomen and population issues; and environmental problems -\nin particular, desertification.\nThe adoption in Paris in 1990 of a programme of action\nfor the least developed countries rightly gave rise to a great\ndeal of hope. We cannot but note, however, that three years\nafter its adoption, the economic results have not come up to\nexpectations. According to a 1992 report of the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD):\n\\\"For the least developed countries as a whole, per\ncapita income declined in 1990 and again in 1991.\nThere is little hope that 1992 will be better, and the\nprospects for 1993 are scarcely promising.\\\"\nIt is therefore important to abide by the commitments made\nat the Paris Conference aimed at improving the economic\nsituation of the least developed countries.\nBy the same token, so far as the land-locked countries\nare concerned, steps must be taken to follow through on the\nconclusions and recommendations of the Meeting of\nGovernmental Experts from Land-Locked Countries and\nTransit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor\nCountries and Financial and Development Institutions, held\nin New York in May 1993, in implementation of resolution\n46/212.\nThe Declaration and Plan of Action adopted at the\nWorld Summit for Children and the goals spelled out for the\n1990s on that occasion have set new targets for improving\nthe living conditions of children the world over. All\nmembers of the international community are called upon to\ncontribute to the implementation of commitments made at\nthat Summit. In this connection, we must also see to the\nimplementation of the Consensus of Dakar of 1992, which\nemerged from the International Conference on Assistance to\nAfrican Children.\nMy delegation has high hopes of international meetings\nto be held over the next several years on resolving social\nproblems, both at the individual State level and\ninternationally.\nThe World Summit for Social Development, scheduled\nfor 1995 in Copenhagen, will be a key event for our\nOrganization. We expect good results from that Summit and\nhope that it will contribute to narrowing the gap between\nsocial groups within a single entity, North and South.\nThe World Conference on Women, scheduled to be\nheld in 1995 in Beijing, will also afford us an opportunity to\nreview the various programmes and initiate further action\naimed at establishing an effective policy to bring women into\nthe development process.\nAnother important gathering will be the World\nConference on Population and Development, scheduled for\n1994 in Cairo. This Conference will make it possible to\ndefine a new strategy for developing human resources,\nhaving regard to economic and environmental factors.\nEnvironmental problems now occupy an important place\nin national, regional and international development\nprogrammes. The United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in\nJune 1992, laid the groundwork for sound joint management\nof development.\nAgenda 21, the Convention on Climate Change and the\nConvention on Biological Diversity demonstrated the\nreadiness of the signatories of those historic documents to\nmove away from current production and consumption\npatterns. Implementing commitments made in Rio requires\nmobilizing substantial financial resources for developing\ncountries and strengthening their scientific, technical and\ninstitutional capabilities.\nMali welcomes the creation by the Economic and\nSocial Council (ECOSOC) of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, in accordance with resolution\n47/191. At its first session, held in June 1993, the\nCommission dealt with fundamental problems which must be\nsolved if Agenda 21 is to become a reality.\nOne of the chief goals is to mobilize financial\nresources. Restructuring the Global Environment Facility\n(GEF), democratizing its management rules and decisionmaking rules and mobilizing additional resources must\nfacilitate the execution of the various chapters of Agenda 21.\nFighting drought and desertification is one of the main\ngoals that African countries have set for themselves. My\ncountry, two thirds of whose surface is desert, and which has\nsuffered the terrible impact of drought over the last 20 years,\nwelcomes the setting up of the Intergovernmental\nNegotiating Committee for the elaboration of an international\nconvention to combat drought and desertification. At the\ntwo substantive Committee sessions held respectively in\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 47\nNairobi, in June this year, and in Geneva, in September this\nyear, there was an evaluation of the problem of\ndesertification. Information was exchanged and data that can\nbe taken into account in future negotiations were collected.\nMy delegation hopes that the current negotiations on the\nconvention to fight drought and desertification will lead to\na real commitment so that the international conference\nscheduled for Paris will be a real success.\nThe issues I have just raised show that the problems of\nkeeping peace and maintaining international security, as well\nas the problems of economic, social and environmental\ndevelopment, are all major challenges that continue to face\nmankind as it approaches the threshold of the third\nmillennium.\nMy delegation feels that to meet these challenges we\nmust, in view of the fundamental changes since the 1960s,\npromote greater democratization and a fairer division of\ninternational responsibility. Thus developing countries that\nhave won international sovereignty, and that represent nearly\ntwo thirds of the population of our planet, rightly call for\nrepresentation on the Security Council as permanent\nmembers.\nMeeting these challenges also requires close cooperation\nand real solidarity amongst all the players on the world\nstage. This means that it is more than ever necessary to\nreflect deeply on and re-examine, the principles and rules for\ninternational cooperation.\nThe restructuring exercise to revitalize the economic\nand social sectors of the United Nations affords us an\nopportunity to make our Organization more dynamic in\ndevelopment matters and to ensure that it plays a central\nrole, in keeping with the provisions of its Charter and the\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions.\nMy delegation, while welcoming the progress made in\nreforming the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and\ncertain of its subsidiary bodies, believes that our thinking\nmust go beyond strictly institutional terms. In any event, my\ncountry feels that the imperative of restructuring is to\nmaintain and indeed strengthen the United Nations capacity\nfor intervention in development matters.\nIn implementing this policy we must pay particular\nattention to furthering and strengthening South-South\ncooperation through socio-economic programmes based upon\nthe realities within the developing countries. Indeed, the\nrevival of economic and technical cooperation between\ndeveloping countries is an integral part of a strategy aimed\nat restoring growth and development worldwide.\nFinally, my country supports the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to make the administrative machinery of\nthe United Nations more efficient by avoiding duplication\nand minimizing operating costs.\nFor several years now the world has been going\nthrough major changes. If these profound transformations\nare to benefit all mankind, they must be accompanied and\nsupported by concrete action making it possible to guide\nthem in the right direction. While these upheavals have\nbeen managed successfully by some States, their extent has\ntaken others by surprise, and the problems have exceeded\ntheir ability to contain and control them. Lacking the\nmeans, they find aid from the international community\nindispensable. It is at this level that many expect\nintervention from our Organization, and we can indeed help.\nThe people and Government of Mali have made\nimportant, clear choices: first, to consolidate the strong suits\nof a Malian nation that is united, though diverse in its\ncultural and racial composition, as it is carefully and\nirreversibly building a progressive democracy; secondly, to\ncarry out in-depth economic reform in harmony with the\nneeds of worldwide free trade and with the concerns of our\npartners in the international community; thirdly, to\nimplement a bold policy of involving our people in\nmanaging their own affairs and simplifying legislation and\npublic programmes; and fourthly, to pursue long-term\nsustainable development in a framework of institutions for\nsubregional and regional economic integration and in\npartnership with all our friends across Africa. We believe\nthat the United Nations and the international community\nhave everything to gain from supporting our original and\nexciting experiment, the hallmark of a new kind of\ninternational relations, at once nobler and more rewarding.\n"

        "file_text": "I\nshould like first to say, Mr. President, that France is pleased\nto see the General Assembly meeting under your guidance\nthis year. Your election is just testimony to the esteem in\nwhich the international community holds your country. It\nalso affords us the opportunity to welcome the \\\"silent\nrevolution\\\" that has been taking place in Latin America over\nthe past few years, which has put many States back on the\npath of national reconciliation, democracy and economic\ndevelopment.\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe year which is ending will have been as rich in\npromise as it has been fraught with danger. Conflicts once\nthought to be insoluble suddenly seem to be on track\ntowards resolution. On behalf of my country, I should like\nto pay tribute to the men in the Middle East, in South Africa\nand in Cambodia who found the courage to take the path\ntowards reconciliation and peace: Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser\nArafat, F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, His Majesty\nKing Norodom Sihanouk and all those, known and unknown,\nwho accompanied or even preceded them on this courageous\npath.\nThe agreement between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) opens the way to the\nsettlement of a conflict which some had despaired of seeing\nresolved, and makes it possible to conceive of a radically\nnew future for the entire region. This revolution gives us\nnew reason to believe in human will and encourages us\nnever to consider the hope for peace as a chimera. From us,\nit calls for collective effort, including financial effort, in\norder to translate this hope into reality as soon as possible.\nIt also invites us to erase the aftermath of conflicts as\nreflected in past resolutions of this Assembly.\nBut the end of what was for years called the balance of\nterror has also led to new kinds of uncertainty and disorder.\nRussia is going through a political and economic\ntransition that could lead to serious internal difficulties, as\nthe events of the past few days have shown. In that context,\nI should like to reaffirm France\u2019s support for the process of\ndemocratization and reform courageously undertaken by\nPresident Yeltsin.\nIn the former Yugoslavia war has been raging for two\nyears, with its attendant death, suffering and destruction.\nOther regions in Africa, Central Asia, the Balkans and the\nCaucasus are falling or could fall victim to this new type of\nconflict, resulting from the break-up of States and the\nresurgence of nationalist, ethnic or religious passions.\nElsewhere, States put under a sanctions regime by our\nOrganization for failing to comply with the obligations of\ninternational law or with commitments they have made\npersist in refusing to take the measures that would permit\nthem to regain their place in the international community.\nAlmost everywhere, the proliferation of weapons is a\nfearsome factor for instability.\nIn the face of the promises and dangers I have just\noutlined, France bases its foreign policy on a few guiding\nprinciples. Whether they are found reassuring or disturbing,\nI should like to recall them to the Assembly.\nThe first principle is the desire for independence.\nFrance has amply demonstrated that it is ready to act in\nconcert with others where the ends are genuinely collective.\nBut, needless to say, it does so in complete sovereignty.\nExercising freedom of judgement and choice, France refuses\nto follow the orthodoxy of the moment or to succumb to\npressures resulting from relative material strengths.\nThe second principle, shared by many in this Hall, is a\ncommitment to our fundamental interests. Like every other\nState in this Organization, France has its own strategic,\ncommercial and cultural interests which it seeks to preserve.\nWhile we are open to negotiation and to the mutual\nconcessions it implies, we cannot be made to give up\nanything we consider to be an essential element of our\nsecurity, our prosperity or our culture.\nThe third principle is devotion to law and justice.\nBeyond its own interests, France aspires to help ensure that\ncertain fundamental principles first inspired by France,\namong others, triumph throughout the world: the right of\npeoples to self-determination and security, human rights and\nthe right to development.\nFinally, one last aspect of our diplomacy, in the service\nof the others, is France\u2019s perseverance, and at times\nstubbornness. May I recall our resolve - despite obstacles -\nin opening up the path that would eventually lead to the\nrestoration of peace in Cambodia, and our determination to\nsee institutional legality restored in Haiti.\nThese unchanging principles dictate the two main lines\nof the policy which my country hopes to implement on the\ninternational stage.\nOur ambition concerns Europe first of all.\nWhatever the present difficulties, whatever the\nprevailing scepticism, France will not falter in its resolve to\nbuild with its neighbours a strong, prosperous, democratic\nand generous Europe, capable of making its voice heard and\nof contributing to world peace. This is an irrevocable choice\nfor us because the peoples of Europe need a plan that brings\nthem together, and European unity is the only goal that\nmeasures up to the values they share. Moreover, the\nbuilding of a united Europe is the only way to avert the\ndangers threatening our continent at this time: dangers\narising from the resurgence of the most implacable forms of\nnationalism and from the persistence of unacceptable\neconomic disparities. Europe\u2019s success will serve as an\nexample for other regions of the world as did in its day the\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 23\nreconciliation between France and Germany sought by\nGeneral de Gaulle and Chancellor Adenauer.\nI have already spoken of the conflict raging in the\nformer Yugoslavia.\nFrance has spared no effort to put an end to it. As you\nknow, France initiated most of the Security Council\nresolutions designed to discourage or punish aggressors.\nTogether with its partners, France provides an essential part\nof the humanitarian aid sent there. Its soldiers represent the\nlargest of the contingents made available to the United\nNations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), and more than a\ndozen of them have paid for their generous presence there\nwith their lives. It has so far been the only country to send\nreinforcements in accordance with resolution 836 (1993) in\norder to contribute to the security of the protected areas and\nthe Muslim populations there. France was, as well, the first\nnation to deplore the inadequacy of the actions taken by the\ninternational community in regard to the former Yugoslavia.\nThe efforts it has made entitled it to tell those who have\nbeen free with their advice and lessons that they might be\nbetter heard if they were agreeing, when they are able to do\nso, to commit their own troops to the field. Once in contact\nwith the realities of the situation, they would undoubtedly\nbetter appreciate the fact that between negotiated peace and\nchaos there is no middle ground.\nLet us learn the lessons of this painful experience. It\nis essential for us to acquire the means to avoid the\nrepetition of such a conflict, and to ensure, without waiting\nfor future progress in the construction of a united Europe,\nthat preventive diplomacy, military openness and respect for\nthe rule of law prevail wherever latent tensions remain. This\nis the intent of the proposed pact on European stability\nwhich France has submitted to its European partners and to\nwhich it would like to associate Russia, as well as its allies\nacross the Atlantic, Canada and the United States.\nEurope is, of course, far from being the sole horizon of\nFrance\u2019s action. My country has long-standing, close\nrelations with many parts of the world. For the long-term\norganization of the international scene in the aftermath of the\ncold war, France naturally turns to the United Nations.\nBecause it believes in the mission of the United\nNations, France wants a strong and effective Organization.\nThis goal involves, first of all, the reforming of the\nSecurity Council. Its enlargement, which has become\nnecessary today in the light of the world\u2019s evolution, must\nbe envisioned as the way to increase its effectiveness.\nFrance understands and supports the aspirations of some\nof its partners to exercise their international responsibilities\nmore actively, provided that they are ready to commit\nthemselves in the field. However, the expansion of the\nCouncil should not be achieved at the expense of one or\nanother group of States; in particular, it must preserve the\ncapacity of the developing countries to make their voices\nheard. In our view, this is an essential requirement.\nIn their wisdom, those who drafted the Charter\nrecognized that only a group of limited size could take\nprompt measures to restore peace when confronted with an\nurgent crisis. We should therefore take care that the\nprojected enlargement does not lead to a paralysis of the\nCouncil.\nFrance hopes that at its present session the General\nAssembly will decide to open discussions on ways to reform\nthe Security Council. A solution will have to be found that\nreconciles the will to reform with the desire for\neffectiveness. This is why enlargement, in our view, will\nhave to be decided according to a formula combining new\npermanent members and additional non-permanent members.\nThe Secretary-General is a key institution of the United\nNations. France would like him to be given the means to\ncarry through the innovative action he has undertaken.\nAllow me to pay a tribute to the energy, authority and\ncourage with which our Secretary-General is carrying out his\nmissions.\nFrance approves not only of his political initiatives but\nalso of his tireless efforts to rationalize the functioning of\nour Organization. We must combat the proliferation of\ninstitutions, which consumes our resources and threatens the\ncoherence of our efforts. We must improve the coordination\nof activities linked to development and restore to the\nEconomic and Social Council its role as a provider of\nstimulus and organization. We must combat administrative\nwaste wherever it exists, without hesitating to punish any\nabuses that may be uncovered. Lastly, we must have more\nsupervision and greater transparency in peace-keeping\noperations.\nThe Secretary-General still does not have all the means\nto exercise his responsibility to the full. France calls on the\nMember States to provide him with those means without\ndelay. Strengthening the Department of Peace-keeping\nOperations, establishing a mechanism for a true general\ninspection, and setting up a court for budgetary discipline\nare, in our eyes, indispensable measures.\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe third requirement for strengthening the\nOrganization is a clean-up of its finances.\nPerhaps I should have begun with this point.\nAccording to an old French saying, money is \\\"the sinew of\nwar\\\". It is also the sinew of peace. Our projects for this\nOrganization will be no more than empty words unless we\nhave the courage to adopt the new measures that its financial\nbankruptcy requires.\nFirst, Member States which do not pay their\ncontributions within 30 days following the\nSecretary-General\u2019s call for contributions should be\npenalized. France proposes that market-rate interest should\nbe imposed on all late payments. This firm stance seems\nparticularly necessary because the payment of accumulated\narrears alone would suffice to resolve the financial crisis. It\nis also consistent with considerations of fairness and political\nmorality. One cannot simultaneously speak of United\nNations reform, justice and international development and\nexempt oneself from the primary financial obligation\nresulting from adherence to our Charter. It is high time to\nmeasure the generosity of words against the yardstick of\narrears due our Organization.\nThe establishment of a mechanism for a true general\ninspection will, as I have said, make it possible to rationalize\nthe functioning and costs of the United Nations. France will\nsupport all initiatives to supplement the existing procedures\nof internal assessment, which have already shown their\nlimitations despite the judicious reorganization recently\nintroduced by the Secretary-General.\nLastly, we must adopt an exemplary budget for the\n1994-1995 period. We must not hesitate to reduce\nexpenditures for obsolete activities. We will also have to\nprovide sufficient funding for the new mandates entrusted to\nthe Organization. If, from that, it is necessary to consider a\nreasonable increase in the ordinary budget, France, which\nhas never espoused a dogmatic idea of zero growth, will\nreadily accept this.\nThese are concrete measures. They require a collective\neffort on the part of Member States. But France is\nconvinced that we can no longer be satisfied, as in previous\nyears, with marginal adjustments. The very ability of the\nUnited Nations to carry out its mandate is at stake.\nFrance, as you will have realized, is ambitious for the\nUnited Nations. With the support of renovated institutions\nand reorganized financing, the United Nations will be able\nto meet the great responsibilities incumbent on it: to preserve\npeace and collective security, to promote development and\nto address global problems whose international scale\nremoves them from the individual action of States.\nPeace is of course the first of our responsibilities.\nThe present instability in several parts of the world\ncompels the United Nations to intervene more and more\nfrequently in order to check the spread of conflicts and allow\na negotiated solution to be sought. France, for its part, has\nwished to participate fully in this effort and is today in the\nfront rank of States participating in peace-keeping\noperations.\nThis commitment obviously does not confer any\nprivilege on us. But our experience enables us to cast a lucid\neye over the operations in which we have participated and\nencourages us to reaffirm certain principles and to propose\ncertain common-sense measures that might help increase the\nfuture effectiveness of our action.\nFirst, greater political control is needed over operations\nthat have become increasingly complex. Purely military\nconsiderations should never thwart - or even obscure -\npolitical ends. Naturally, regional or defence organizations\nmay make useful contributions in terms of expertise,\npersonnel or mat\u00e9riel. But the use of force presupposes that\nthe guardian of the law - that is, the Security Council -\nexercises its authority in the name of the international\ncommunity. This it cannot relinquish. That is why France\ninsisted that the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative\nto the former Yugoslavia should have authority over all\noperations under international mandate. It is important, it\nseems to me, that we should maintain this requirement at all\ntimes. By the same token, France insists that the political\nends of the operation in Somalia should not be lost sight of.\nNext, we should systematically consider the question of\nthe timetable of operations.\nAs a matter of principle, time-frames should be\nexplicitly assigned to each operation in the actual resolution\nthat institutes it. It is also important to know when to\nterminate operations that go on and on, needlessly dipping\ninto the means of the Organization and its Member States.\nFrance fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts on this\nscore.\nLastly, we must expand the capacity of the\nOrganization to react. The time that elapses between our\ndecision to create a force and the implementation of that\ndecision is far too long. How many weeks did we have to\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 25\nwait before the air power authorized by resolution\n836 (1993) on Bosnia was eventually deployed? And how\nmany weeks for the ground reinforcements that had been\nannounced to reach Sarajevo?\nWe cannot but note that the current procedures do not\nmeet the criteria for rapid reaction and flexible use which\nare called for in this area.\nFrance does not, however, believe that the Organization\nshould have its own force. On the other hand, it has\nparticipated in discussions organized by the\nSecretariat-General on the concept of stand-by units. These\ndiscussions have resulted in original proposals for \\\"tailormade\\\" forces for the United Nations. In this way, the\nOrganization could have at its disposal support, transport and\ncommunications capabilities which it currently lacks for\ncarrying out military actions speedily.\nFrance, which has already offered, in a statement made\nby the President of the French Republic, to make available\nto the Secretary-General a 1,000-strong contingent for peacekeeping operations at 48 hours\u2019 notice, will take part in this\neffort.\nThese measures will have another advantage. They will\nadd an extra degree of effectiveness to preventive diplomacy,\nwhich has to be central to the ambitions we have for the\nOrganization. This policy requires us to develop and put in\nplace mechanisms for crisis alert, evaluation and prevention.\nSeveral ideas were put forward in the \\\"Agenda for\nPeace\\\" - they included use of fact-finding missions and the\neffective deployment of United Nations forces - and have\nalready been applied to certain difficult situations in Africa,\nCentral Asia and the Balkans.\nIn this spirit, the United Kingdom and France are ready\nto submit to the Secretary-General proposals for compiling\na list of prominent individuals who could intervene promptly\nat his request, in liaison with appropriate regional\norganizations, and provide them with equipment -\nspecifically in the communications field - necessary for\ncarrying out their mission completely.\nIt is through concrete initiatives of this sort, which may\nseem modest at first, that preventive diplomacy will\ngradually assume its rightful place in the maintenance of\npeace.\nThe effort made in relation to disarmament in the past\nfew years, finally, should continue.\nConsiderable progress has already been made with the\nreduction of stockpiles from the cold-war era. But a new\npriority is becoming evident: the struggle against the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To attain this\ngoal, we must be extremely vigilant in the threefold domain\nof nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and ballistic\ntechnologies.\nIn this light, France welcomes the signing in Paris by\nnearly 150 States of the Convention banning chemical\nweapons, the first real multilateral disarmament pact of\ngeneral scope, and calls on the States which have not yet\nratified this Convention to do so. It supports the efforts\nbeing made by several groups of countries to institute\nsystems of control of missile technology, nuclear exports and\nthe sale of so-called sensitive products.\nFrance asks, finally, that the non-proliferation regimes\nbe strengthened. It reaffirms in particular its desire to see\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty prolonged indefinitely and\nunconditionally. It continues to believe that it is only the\nSecurity Council that can decide on sanctions against\nirresponsible behaviour. This would be the case if North\nKorea were to fail to respect its commitments to the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency.\nWhat guarantees can be given for collective security\nand peace if nothing is done to try to resolve the economic\nand social disparities that are so often the source of conflict?\nWe know that there can be no lasting peace without lasting\neconomic development. That is why the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\"\nunquestionably requires also an \\\"agenda for development\\\".\nFrance, as is known, has consistently spoken for the\ninterests of the developing countries, particularly the least\ndeveloped, in discussion with its industrialized partners. It\nhas tirelessly pleaded - sometimes as a voice crying in the\nwilderness - for a substantial increase in the level of official\ndevelopment assistance in order to permit these countries to\nenjoy trade advantages without reciprocity, to ease their debt\nburden and stabilize raw-material prices. Our resolve in this\nmatter will not weaken: how can we accept, for example, a\nsituation in which every year the African countries pay the\nWorld Bank more than they receive from it?\nNor can we accept the persistence, and sometimes the\nworsening, of the most glaring situations of distress. France\nhas not forgotten the depth of the crisis in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, with which it has so many ties. It believes it is\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nessential that the basic achievements of cooperation between\nthe European Community and the African, Caribbean and\nPacific countries, should be maintained, especially with\nregard to trade.\nLastly, our third ambition for the United Nations\nconcerns the vast issue of societal questions, linked naturally\nto the requirements of development but distinct from it.\nThe protection of human rights, the preservation of the\nenvironment, aid to refugees, the struggle against full-scale\nepidemics, organized crime and drug trafficking all have a\nworldwide dimension. The Organization must address these\nproblems with the same energy it expends in the search for\npeace and the promotion of development.\nSeveral important dates lie ahead of us. Let us apply\nwithout delay the recommendations unanimously adopted at\nthe Vienna Conference on Human Rights, particularly the\ncreation of a post of high commissioner for human rights.\nLet us prepare for the conferences in Cairo and Beijing and\nthe social development summit in Copenhagen with all the\nnecessary determination, so as to reinforce the cooperation\nrequired in addressing demographic problems, the promotion\nof women\u2019s rights and the demands for social development.\nGreat epidemics have always been a threat to the\nworld\u2019s nations. But the need for full-scale international\nmobilization is becoming particularly acute in the case of\nAIDS in view of the havoc of all kinds caused by the spread\nof this malady. I earnestly hope that, as we approach the\nsecond decade of this struggle, the coherence of United\nNations action, and that of its specialized agencies and of all\nStates and interested organizations, will be equal to this new\nchallenge. In this context, France proposes the convening of\na conference next year to bring together the main contributor\ncountries in the war against this scourge in order to improve\ncoordination of their efforts and give them a new impetus.\nIn most cases, these phenomena are not new. However,\nthe challenge they pose to our societies, in the North and in\nthe South, is of unprecedented seriousness. They affect\nunderdevelopment as much as they do the excesses of the\nconsumer society, and our traditional responses are proving\nto be inadequate or ineffective. We need new ideas in this\narea. The Secretary-General should have broad power to\ntake initiatives and make proposals in this matter. France\ntherefore suggests the formation of a group of prominent\nfigures chosen for their intellectual and scientific abilities\nand moral influence to assist him in this vital task at the end\nof our century.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27\nSetting forth such ambitions for the United Nations\nmight have made the sceptics smile a few years ago. With\nthe end of the cold war the international community has a\nhistoric opportunity: no longer to dismiss problems but\nperhaps to solve them; no longer to limit conflicts but\nperhaps to settle them.\nLet us remain clear-sighted. This period could be\nmerely a brief interlude. If we were to hesitate, would it be\nlong before peoples succumbed to their basest inclinations,\ncast off the rules of international law or put themselves - in\nthe best of cases - under the sole protection of regional,\ncompeting and potentially hostile solidarities?\nWe do not have unlimited time. It is therefore our duty\nto undertake without delay the reforms required to strengthen\nour Organization and to realize its new objectives.\nI should like to assure the Assembly that in the pursuit\nof these twin goals, the United Nations can count on\nFrance\u2019s firm resolve.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like to congratulate\nMr. Insanally on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. While opening our\nsession, he rightly reminded us of the hopes now placed in\nthis universal forum - to which we welcome six new\nMembers - and of the growing need for what he described\nas a collective vision of our future.\nAllow me to convey to the Government and the people\nof India the deepest sympathy of the Irish people for the\nvictims of the earthquake.\nWe meet here at a time of great hope for the peoples of\nthe Middle East. Years of bitter antagonism and conflict\nhave yielded to agreement and, we hope, reconciliation\nbetween the two great historical traditions in an area that has\nseen far too much bloodshed. The signature of the\nagreement in Washington was an act of the highest\nstatesmanship and courage. It deserves a commensurate\nresponse from the other countries of the region and from the\ninternational community.\nI welcome President Clinton\u2019s speedy initiative in\nconvening today a conference on aid to Palestine. We in\nIreland stand ready to play our part, together with our\npartners in the European Community. We will increase\nsubstantially our aid to the West Bank and Gaza, and we\nwill take steps to strengthen and develop our good relations\nwith Israel and with the Palestinian people.\nIt is also a time of great hope for the people of South\nAfrica. When the prisoner of Robben Island, Nelson\nMandela, states, in Afrikaans to an Afrikaner audience, that\nwhat is done, is done, and looks to a shared future for all\nSouth Africans, it sends a powerful message to all of us.\nA new South Africa is in the making. We have waited\nand striven long for this day. I am happy to announce that\nwe in Ireland have decided to establish diplomatic relations\nwith that new South Africa.\nIt is a time of hope, but also of apprehension,\nparticularly for the people of Russia. The course of reform\nis not yet complete. I am confident that the way forward\nidentified by President Yeltsin will continue to be endorsed\nby the people so that Russia may continue on the path to\nstable democracy and sustained economic development.\nThe recent changes in international life have brought\ngreat and lasting benefits to many: to those who endured\nauthoritarian forms of government for decades and have now\ngained the freedom to exercise their basic human and civil\nrights; to peoples released from the super-Power competition\nthat enabled dictatorial and repressive regimes to act with\nimpunity; to the wider international community that no\nlonger lives under the threat of global nuclear conflagration.\nYet the optimism that characterized the early days of the\npost-cold-war period has been tempered by the realization\nthat for every advance in the Middle East or in South Africa,\nthere is an Angola, or a Yugoslavia, a Somalia, a Sudan.\nFor all our progress, thousands continue to die in brutal\nwars, thousands more suffer from gross abuses of human\nrights and millions are denied their basic right to food, water\nand shelter. There is still a great distance to be travelled to\na world of justice, equality and true respect for the\nindividual.\nPeople look here, to the United Nations, to help them\ntravel that distance. Faced with this hope, this expectation -\nthis demand - our Organization today must meet challenges\nof a kind that it has not had to cope with in the past,\nchallenges qualitatively different from the international and\nregional disputes that have traditionally absorbed so much of\nthe United Nations energies.\nWe are coming to understand better the interrelated\nnature of these tasks: the struggle to end war; to advance\ndemocracy; to promote economic development; to protect the\ndignity of the individual; to ensure freedom and the rule of\nlaw; to protect the environment; to deal with the problems\nof population - all are part of the same effort. Success in\none requires progress in others.\nWe are coming to understand too that the activities of\nStates and Governments require the broader cooperative\ncontext of the United Nations. As our problems are\ntransnational, so too must be our response.\nThe fact is that we need a United Nations whose\norganization and decisions truly represent the will of the\ninternational community. We need a United Nations whose\nactivities truly address the great contemporary challenges,\nand we need a United Nations that is not hindered by lack\nof resources in personnel and finance.\nAt no time in its history has the need to re-examine and\nstrengthen the United Nations system been greater or more\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 31\nwidely felt, and these themes of representation, relevance\nand resources are at the heart of the debate about the reform\nof the United Nations.\nAs the body charged with the primary responsibility for\ninternational peace and security, it is imperative that the\nSecurity Council should function well and with authority.\nThe Council\u2019s response to the huge demands that have been\nmade of it in recent years has been impressive. The number\nand scope of its decisions are greater than ever before, and\nthe import of those decisions for States and for peoples\neverywhere is more far-reaching.\nAnd yet, we must ask if the Council truly represents the\nalmost universal membership of the Organization and\nreflects fully the great changes that have taken place in\neconomic and political relations. These are questions of the\ndeepest significance for international cooperation, but I\nbelieve that unless they are addressed now, the political\nauthority of the Security Council and its capacity to act\ndecisively and with confidence will be eroded.\nIreland therefore supports the case for an increase in the\nmembership of the Security Council. I hope that decisions\non this can be taken before the fiftieth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations in two years\u2019 time.\nThere is a need also for greater transparency in Security\nCouncil decision-making. The general membership, though\nit takes no part in the Council\u2019s decisions, is bound by them,\nand we are frequently called on to supply personnel and\nfinance to implement the Council\u2019s expanded and\nincreasingly complex mandates. We must work for a more\ninteractive relationship between the Council and the General\nAssembly, and for more frequent and substantive reporting\nby the Council to the general membership. And we must\nlook for ways to make the Assembly itself more effective.\nIt is ironic that for most of its existence, when the\nUnited Nations was not always deemed to be the appropriate\nforum for the resolution of major disputes, the Organization\nwas for the most part adequately resourced. Yet today,\nwhen the demands for action by the United Nations have\nreached unprecedented levels, when ideological division no\nlonger inhibits an effective United Nations role and when the\napproach to problem-solving at Security Council level is\nessentially cooperative, the Organization finds itself\nburdened with a grave and crippling financial crisis.\nThe Secretary-General has told us that the Organization\nis living from hand to mouth. He warns us that the financial\nsituation could soon prevent the United Nations from\ndischarging its essential responsibilities and undermine its\npolitical will and practical capacity to undertake any new\nactivities. And yet the simple truth is this: for every dollar\nthat the United Nations spends on the instruments of peace,\nthe world spends almost $2,000 on the weapons of war.\nIt is simply not acceptable to call on the United Nations\nto undertake new responsibilities while declining or failing\nto provide the necessary resources. A significant\nimprovement in the Organization\u2019s finances is now an urgent\npriority. I appeal to all Member States in arrears, and\nespecially those on the Security Council, to comply with\ntheir financial obligations under the Charter. This is a moral\nas well as a practical imperative.\nThe impact of change is particularly apparent in the\narea of peace-keeping. In almost every crisis, on every\ncontinent, United Nations forces are deployed on\nincreasingly varied and complex tasks. By the end of this\nyear the numbers in the field may total 100,000. And\nindividual operations are now very large: nearly 20,000\neach in Cambodia and Somalia; almost 25,000 in former\nYugoslavia. Ireland now participates in 10 of the 14 United\nNations peace-keeping operations in the field. A significant\nproportion of our armed forces is at present engaged in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping duties.\nBut, beyond the scale of the operations, the nature of\nthe tasks undertaken by United Nations forces has changed\nalso. The initial decision to intervene militarily in Somalia\nfor humanitarian purposes and the subsequent decision to\nmandate the United Nations Operation in Somalia\n(UNOSOM) to take enforcement action are new departures\nfor the Organization. And they present new challenges for\ntroop-contributing countries. In Ireland\u2019s case we had to\nchange our law to enable our forces to take part in the\nChapter VII operation in Somalia.\nIt is important for all of us - the United Nations, the\ntroop contributors, and those whom we seek to help - to\nreflect carefully on our experiences and draw the lessons\nfrom the new large-scale operations in Cambodia, Somalia\nand Yugoslavia.\nIt is evident that existing structures both at United\nNations Headquarters and in the field have come under very\nconsiderable strain. The mandates of major United Nations\noperations are now multi-faceted. We need mechanisms that\nwill allow such mandates to be carried through in a manner\nthat is effective, transparent and humane. I want to mention\ntwo points in particular here today.\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe first is the imperative need to maintain peace -\nkeeping and peace-enforcement operations within an overall\npolitical framework and to exploit every opportunity for\nreconciliation. Enforcement action, when it is undertaken -\nand I accept that it may be necessary - should be the\nminimum required and it should be carefully directed to\nachieving the political aims of the operation. For this\nreason, I believe that at the time the Security Council takes\na decision to establish an operation, particularly one\ninvolving peace enforcement, it should pay special attention\nto the issues of command and control.\nSecondly, there is a need to improve military planning\nat United Nations Headquarters and to ensure that the best\nmilitary advice and information is available to the\nSecretary-General in his conduct of peace-keeping\noperations. To this end, an effective planning unit is\nrequired. Thought should also be given to whether the\nMilitary Staff Committee, which is provided for in the\nCharter but which has never functioned effectively, could\nhave a contribution to make.\nIn Somalia, the overriding objective of the United\nNations operation must be political reconciliation and\nnational reconstruction.\nThere have been outstanding successes. One year ago,\nseveral hundreds were dying each day from hunger and\nmalnutrition. Today, as a result of the work of the Unified\nTask Force (UNITAF), UNOSOM and the non-governmental\norganizations, people are no longer dying from man-made\nfamine. A year ago violence was widespread. Today almost\nall of Somalia is calm.\nThe exception is south Mogadishu, where the efforts of\nUNOSOM have been continually frustrated and many,\nincluding 60 United Nations peace-keepers, have lost their\nlives. In pursuance of its overall aim of political\nreconciliation, the United Nations must continue its search\nfor a peaceful resolution in Mogadishu, learning from and\nbuilding on its success elsewhere in Somalia.\nMost of the conflicts that this Assembly will address in\nthe coming weeks are marked by massive abuses of human\nrights - summary executions, torture, detention, rape,\nmutilation. And even outside of these open conflicts the\ndignity of the individual is frequently violated by\nauthoritarian and repressive regimes. At Vienna in June, the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights sought to strengthen the\nprotection of human rights worldwide. Most of us who\nattended that meeting came away feeling that progress had\nindeed been made. It is essential that the agreed Programme\nof Action be given the highest priority and acted on by this\nAssembly. A United Nations commissioner for human rights\nshould be appointed. The resources devoted to human rights\nactivities in the United Nations system should be doubled.\nThe United Nations human rights machinery, especially in\nrelation to the protection of women, should be strengthened.\nAnd we must make decisive progress on the establishment\nof an international criminal tribunal to prosecute persons\nresponsible for violations of humanitarian law wherever they\noccur.\nThe abuses of human rights in Yugoslavia have\nprovoked a profound determination in the international\ncommunity that those responsible must be brought to justice.\nThe ad hoc approach, unavoidable in the case of Yugoslavia,\npoints to the need for a permanent international criminal\ntribunal with an established jurisdiction and an identified\nbody of applicable law. The General Assembly at this\nsession should examine the valuable work done on this topic\nby the International Law Commission.\nWe can take advantage of the changed international\nsituation to pursue our work on disarmament and arms\ncontrol. We must intensify our efforts to halt the spread of\nnuclear weapons. I am heartened by the decision of some\nnuclear States to maintain a moratorium on nuclear testing\nand I call on others to do the same. Our objective must be\na comprehensive treaty banning nuclear testing forever.\nIreland has proposed that the United Nations should\nelaborate a code of conduct for conventional arms transfers\nwhich would encourage States to exercise responsibility and\nrestraint in their arms transfers and which would set out\ncommon principles to be observed in this area. We believe\nthat, as the international community moves towards a closer\nunderstanding of its shared responsibility for international\nsecurity in the framework of the United Nations, such a code\nwould represent an important step forward in the area of\narms control.\nLast year Ireland called for an agenda for development\nthat would complement and stand alongside the\nSecretary-General\u2019s \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\". We are pleased\nthat such a report is now in preparation. Our vision of the\nfuture cannot ignore the images of deprivation and need we\nsee every day from all too many parts of the world. The\nreality of this suffering is a test for all of us. The Irish\nGovernment is committed to doubling the percentage of\ngross national product devoted to official development aid in\nthe period 1993 to 1997. Peace and development are not\nseparable.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 33\nWe must recognize what the Secretary-General has\ncalled the humanitarian imperative. The international\ncommunity must be assured that the United Nations and its\ndevelopment agencies will respond quickly to emergencies\nas they occur. The creation within the Secretariat of a new\nDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs has been a useful step\ntowards that end.\nThe international community must look squarely at\ncertain incontrovertible features of our shared existence on\nthis planet: climate change, a possible doubling of the\nworld\u2019s population by the middle of the next century,\npressures imposed by our patterns of production and\nconsumption, great imbalances in the availability of\ntechnology and resources. In many of these areas, the Rio\nConference and its Agenda 21 have identified the way\nahead. I am pleased that the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment and other organs provided for in Rio are off to\na promising start.\nWe must acknowledge that the issues we address under\nthe auspices of this Assembly and those which arise in the\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the\nBretton Woods institutions cannot be separated. In all of\nthese areas, our aim must be a peaceful, integrated\ninternational society in which our sense of the common good\nincreasingly qualifies considerations of national power and\nimmediate expediency.\nAs the dramatic developments in the Israeli-Palestinian\nrelationship and the equally historic changes in South Africa\nhave shown, progress is possible even in the most obdurate\nof conflicts if the protagonists are willing to look towards a\ncommon future.\nNorthern Ireland represents a challenge of similar\ndimensions to the British and Irish Governments and to the\npeoples of both islands. Some would say that the conflict is\nfundamentally incapable of resolution. I do not accept that,\nand I will not accept it. Like the vast majority of my\ncompatriots, I yearn for peace on our island.\nI want to see a comprehensive settlement which will\nenable men, women and children to go about their daily\nlives in peace and without fear. All of us in both islands are\npaying the price of past political failures. We should not ask\nfuture generations to bear the cost of further failure.\nI have no illusions about the complexity of the issues.\nI know that there are no easy or quick solutions - no single\nstep that can remove the necessity for a long and painstaking\njourney. But I believe that, with sufficient good will and\ndetermination, the Irish and British Governments and the\nleaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland can\nlead the people they represent out of the stalemate which\nexists at present towards a peaceful and secure future. As\nI have said elsewhere, the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are all\nto hand if only we can find the right way to fit them\ntogether.\nThe Irish Government is ready to play its full part in\nthis. We will bring to any resumed talks the resources of\ngood will, flexibility and imagination which we believe all\nparticipants must display if a new agreement is to be\nachieved.\nIt is painfully obvious that all traditional approaches\nhave failed and that new thinking is urgently required. For\nour part, we are willing to look afresh at our own traditional\nassumptions and at our relationships with others to see if\nthere are new approaches which can open a way forward.\nWe are ready to accept the need for radical and innovative\ncompromise as part of a new accommodation which will\nbring lasting peace and reconciliation to the island of\nIreland.\nCompromise does not mean asking either of the two\ntraditions in Northern Ireland to modify its fundamental\nbeliefs or, indeed, to suppress its objectives. It does mean\nasking each tradition to recognize that the other deserves\nequal respect and must be accommodated on equal terms.\nIt means accepting that diversity can be enriching rather than\nthreatening and that both traditions in Ireland must find a\nway to share the island on a basis of partnership and trust.\nPeace and stability will not be found in any political\nsystem which is imposed, or which is rejected by a\nsubstantial part of the population who live within it.\nWhat we need in the island of Ireland is a collective\nwill to rise above traditional suspicions and animosities and\na readiness to look beyond areas of disagreement to areas\nwhere we can work together to mutual advantage.\nPeace is now the imperative, and the continuation of\nviolence is the single greatest obstacle to the realization of\nour hopes. An end to violence would open up new\npossibilities and allow all of us to emerge from the shadow\nof a very troubled history.\nIt would, at last, help to clear the way for compromise\nand negotiation, leading to an agreement which would\nachieve a fair and lasting accommodation between\nnationalism and unionism in Ireland. We must lift our sights\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nto the new horizons of possibility which developments in the\nMiddle East and South Africa have opened for us. This is\nthe objective of the Government which I represent. I believe\nwe can have no higher objective.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Niger and its people, I wish to extend my\nwarmest salutations to this distinguished Assembly. It is\ntruly with great pleasure that I am taking part in the general\ndebate of the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nAs the first democratically elected President of the\nNiger, I have come to bring members and all the peoples\nrepresented here a message of esteem and friendship,\ngoodwill and cooperation from the people of the Niger. I\nhave come to express the pride of the people of the Niger in\nbelonging to the great family of the United Nations. I have\ncome to reassert its powerful and sincere faith in the ideals\nand principles expressed in the United Nations Charter. I\nhave come to share its anxieties and concerns with members\nand to state our determination to join with all the members\nof the Assembly in the efforts to build a better world for\npresent and future generations.\nFirst, however, may I join the speakers who have\npreceded me in extending to you, Mr. President, our sincere\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election as President\nof the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session.\nBy unanimously giving you the heavy task of guiding\nits work, the General Assembly pays a well-deserved tribute\nto your skills and to your country, Guyana, for its invaluable\ncontribution to the efforts of the United Nations to achieve\nits noble ideals. Of course, I also congratulate the other\nmembers of the Bureau, who I am certain will spare no\neffort to support you in the successful accomplishment of\nyour difficult functions. I also assure you of the full\ncooperation of the Niger delegation.\nTo your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, I\nexpress the compliments of the Niger delegation for the\ncompetence, efficiency and tact with which he presided over\nthe work of the last session.\nFinally, I pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the fresh dynamic he has\nbrought to the United Nations, with a firm commitment to\ninternational development, peace and security. This work\nsince his election to the head of the world Organization\nclearly reflects our concerns. On behalf of Niger, I warmly\ncongratulate him.\nFrom 29 July to 3 November 1991 the active elements\nof the nation of Niger held a National Supreme Conference,\nwhich was a historic opportunity to consider the results of\nNiger\u2019s 30 years of independence and lay the foundations for\nfurther efforts to strengthen the cohesiveness and unity of\nour people and guarantee them the conditions for sustained\nand harmonious development.\nFollowing that Conference, Niger resolutely set forth on\nthe path of democratization, to build for our people a State\nof law founded on the principles of pluralist democracy and\ncommitted to observing and guaranteeing respect for human\nrights as defined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and in the 1981 African Charter of Human\nand National Rights.\nAs a prelude to the democratization process, the people\nof Niger, by an overwhelming majority, adopted in a\nreferendum on 26 December 1992 the Constitution of the\nThird Republic, which guarantees the human rights set out\nin various international instruments and enshrines the\nseparation of powers between the executive, legislative and\njudiciary branches. Furthermore, the Constitution contains\nmany other innovative elements, such as providing for the\nestablishment of a high council of communication, an\nindependent administrative body to ensure and guarantee the\nfreedom and independence of the communications media and\nfair access for political parties, associations and citizens to\nofficial means of information and communications.\nThe Constitution of 26 December 1992 proclaims\nNiger\u2019s commitment to spare no effort to achieve the ideal\nof African unity, as well as its willingness to cooperate in\nfriendship and equality with all peoples devoted to peace,\njustice and freedom.\nOnce the Constitution was adopted the people of Niger\nwent to the polls on 14 February 1993 to elect the 83\nDeputies of the National Assembly, the legislative body of\nthe Third Republic. This Assembly is in every way\nrepresentative of the ethnic diversity of our people and its\npolitical points of view. Indeed, through the creation of\nspecial districts during the elections, in addition to the\nregular administrative districts, every ethnic group in Niger\nis today represented in the National Assembly. The\ngovernment majority is made up of an alliance of nine\npolitical groups, while the opposition is made up of a\ngrouping of three parties holding 33 of the 83 seats in the\nNational Assembly.\nThe democratization process undertaken by my country\nwas completed by the holding, from 14 to 27 March 1993,\nof two-stage presidential elections, in which eight political\ngroups took part. The result was that the people of Niger\nentrusted me with the onerous task of leading them into the\nfuture. It is important to note that throughout the process\nthe people of Niger demonstrated great maturity and behaved\nin an exemplary manner. Tens of thousands participated,\ntravelling great distances and braving the extreme\ntemperatures that are typical of Saharan Africa. They took\npart in a calm, peaceful and disciplined manner, always\nmaintaining the very powerful feelings of brotherhood and\nof belonging to a single nation that unite them. Such\nconduct, which I am happy to praise once again here, earned\nthe people of Niger the esteem, consideration and respect of\nthe hundreds of international observers from all over the\nworld who monitored the elections and attested to their\nfairness and openness.\nThe people of Niger thus made its choice, deciding that\ndemocracy would be the framework of its future. This\nchoice is, to be sure, in keeping with the changing times, in\nkeeping with the direction of history. But we know that\ndemocratization is a long-term undertaking requiring patience\nand selflessness. The great democratic nations of today\nthemselves travelled a long road before reaching their\ncurrent stage of development.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 7\nYoung nations such as Niger which have firmly chosen\nthis path must overcome many obstacles and difficulties\nresulting from the weakness of their socio-economic\nstructures and the international environment.\nFor my country, one of the most important difficulties\nis the armed rebellion in the north, which poses grave risks\nto its unity. This inherited situation is in large part caused\nby the drought in the Sahel, which is making living\nconditions precarious for its nomadic peoples, who already\nface a most hostile and arid environment. The situation is\na cause of great concern to Niger. Therefore, immediately\nit took office on 23 April 1993 the new Government\nknuckled down to finding ways and means to allow a fair\nand speedy solution to the problem to prevail in peace and\nbrotherly trust.\nThe Government has been helped in this undertaking by\nthe valuable assistance of friendly countries, to which I\nextend our sincere thanks and deep gratitude. Thanks to\nthese efforts, on 11 June 1993 the negotiations resulted in a\nthree-month truce which was scrupulously respected by the\nparties and whose terms were recently renewed. There are\nencouraging signs of a speedy solution to this problem being\nfound, and we intend to devote the needed energy to it.\nFrom this rostrum dedicated to peace I express the hope\nthat all the sons of the Niger nation will work together to\nsurmount their present difficulties and build a fraternal,\ndemocratic and prosperous Niger.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights held at\nVienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 reaffirmed that the right to\ndevelopment is a basic human right. It affirmed that\ndemocracy, development and basic human rights are\ninterdependent, reinforcing each other, and it stressed the\noverriding need to support the process of democratization in\ndeveloping countries if we wish to ensure its success.\nNiger remains convinced that freedom and democracy\nneed water to grow, just as fish need water to swim, and that\nthey need to be buttressed by economic and social progress.\nSimilarly, we are convinced that international peace and\nsecurity cannot prevail in the world unless we take into\naccount the vast mass of mankind\u2019s legitimate yearnings for\neconomic and social progress.\nThus, development is a major challenge for the\nfledgling democracies. They must give an urgent and\ncompelling reply to the question: how can we maintain and\ncultivate our faith? That is the ardent question of millions\nof men and women who went to the ballot box to vote and\nwho, after the euphoria of victory, find themselves\nconfronted with the harsh realities of their lives, the endless\nproblems of survival.\nI know that the Assembly has a broad awareness of the\ncountless difficulties that paralyse our peoples in their daily\nlives and impede their development.\nI know that the Assembly is fully informed about the\nunspeakable hardships our peoples have endured for decades\nand our thoughts about them. Indeed, for year after year and\nsession after session, we have been constantly seized of such\ngreat topics as the deterioration in terms of trade, the\nbuttressing of protectionism, the debt crisis, the continuing\ndeterioration of the environment, the growing shrinkage of\npublic development assistance, population growth, and\nreforms in structural adjustment.\nThe listing of those great topics is but an imperfect\nsummary of the fate and the enormous poverty that is the lot\nof a large portion of mankind.\nThe economic situation of the African continent\nprovides an edifying example of that state of affairs. Africa\nhas been experiencing a widespread economic crisis of\nunprecedented severity, the result of a long period of\neconomic recession. For years now, the continent has\nsuffered from this prolonged recession and from a decline in\nliving standards and a breakdown in the social fabric that is\nso widespread and so deep that many of the benefits gained\nin the early years of independence have now been\nirretrievably lost. Today, real per capita income has sunk\nbelow the 1980 level.\nThe relationship between investment and gross national\nproduct continues to deteriorate. Our economies are marked\nby budgetary and trade imbalances and large import\nreductions, aggravated by the drop in the price of raw\nmaterials.\nAccording to some estimates, the ability of some\ncountries to repay, based on exports, is diminishing. Thus,\nthe debt-export relationship, which stood at 97 per cent in\n1980, fell to 233 per cent in 1985 and stood at\napproximately 333 per cent in 1992.\nIn any event, economic indicators give only an\nincomplete picture of the situation and do not enable us to\nvisualize the consequences of drought, famine and the\ndeterioration of the environment. The slump means that in\nsome regions of Africa the standards of living, which had\nalready been among the world\u2019s harshest, have deteriorated\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\neven further, reaching levels that are unacceptable for a\nmodern civilization.\nYet the Governments of those countries have\nrecognized their own weaknesses and laid out areas of\nresponsibility. They have courageously undertaken harsh\nreforms and adopted painful austerity measures for their\npeople aimed at improving their economic and financial\nenvironment.\nFor a number of reasons, these adjustment policies have\nnot produced the expected results. I should point to two of\nthem.\nFirst, there is the inadequacy of financial and material\nmeans, which has prevented us from achieving results and\nconsolidating our gains.\nSecondly, there is our States\u2019 burden of foreign\nindebtedness, which has reached an intolerable level and\nwhich continues to weigh ever more heavily upon them,\nworsening their economic and social difficulties.\nIn those circumstances, how can we expect the poor\ncountries to develop?\nUnderdevelopment is making daily headway, and the\nlist of countries eligible for the soft conditions of the\nInternational Development Association is growing.\nFor that reason, from this rostrum Niger is calling upon\nthe developed countries to give proof of greater solidarity by\nagreeing to a blanket cancellation of the debt of the least-\ndeveloped countries.\nNiger had hoped to hear of this decision following the\nmeeting of the Group of 7, but, unfortunately, the seven\nmost-industrialized countries did not move to improve the\nrepayment abilities of the debtor countries.\nHence, we must curb this development, which has a\nnegative impact on our countries. We must find ways and\nmeans to reverse present trends. We must act in order to\nrestore hope to Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nNiger earnestly hopes that the first Copenhagen summit\non social development will not be another meeting with no\nfollow-up.\nSimilarly, the international conference on population\nand development planned for 1994 should provide an\nopportunity for rich and poor to join efforts against hunger\nand malnutrition.\nCloser to home, in a few days an international\nconference on African development will be held on the\ninitiative of the Government of Japan. Niger hopes that that\nmeeting will come up with the necessary radical measures to\nsolve the problems of the African continent.\nThe world is now enjoying one of those propitious\nmoments for peace that history occasionally provides us.\nProspects today enable us to hope for a better future.\nThe end of East-West antagonism has given rise to a\npowerful movement towards peace and has simultaneously\nawakened great hopes for sustainable development.\nDisarmament, as set forth in the United Nations\nCharter, must entail a system of collective security designed\nto avoid any excessive stockpiling of weapons. Indeed, it is\nof primary importance to establish confidence between\nneighbouring countries that share a similar destiny owing to\nthe many ties joining their respective populations. It is also\nessential that States without weapons of mass destruction\nhave guarantees that their territories will never serve as\ntesting grounds. We believe it is essential that the resources\nthus freed be devoted to eradicating poverty, which still, at\nthe end of the twentieth century, is creating conditions of\nshocking poverty intolerable to the human conscience.\nAnother ground for hope is the recent United Nations\nConference on Human Rights, which has declared the right\nto development to be a universal and inalienable right, an\nintegral part of fundamental human rights.\nHope was also created by the last Rio summit meeting,\nwhich focussed world attention on the threats to our\nenvironment, highlighted the existing interrelationship of\ndevelopment and the environment and thereby stressed the\noverriding need to ensure its preservation in the interests of\npresent and future generations.\nPledges to finance the programmes of Agenda 21 have\nalready been recorded. Niger hopes that the fine hopes\nawakened in Rio will very soon be translated into concrete\nactions. That is why we welcome the creation of operational\nmachinery such as the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment and the intergovernmental committee to draft\nan international convention on desertification and drought.\nNiger, which has had to deal with the galloping and\nfrightening encroachment of the desert, is following with\nclose interest the work of this committee.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 9\nI have spoken at length about Niger and about our\nconcerns and our hopes. However, I should not like to give\nthe impression that the great problems of the world are\nmatters of indifference to us. Notwithstanding the difficult\ntimes through which we are passing, Niger is attentive to\nwhat is going on in the rest of the world. We are\nencouraged by developments in the situation in South Africa,\nand we were relieved to hear the announcement that the first\nfree, democratic elections there would be held on 27 April\n1994. In this regard, we join in the appeal of our brother\nNelson Mandela that the international sanctions imposed on\nSouth Africa be lifted. We believe that the adoption of such\na measure would help to create in that country the\natmosphere of d\u00e9tente and trust that is necessary if the\nemergence of a multiracial, egalitarian and democratic\nsociety is to be promoted. This would lead to South\nAfrica\u2019s entry into the African arena and its return to the\nconcert of the civilized nations of the world.\nIt was with real relief that we received the results of the\nGeneva negotiations between the various parties to the\nconflict in Liberia, which led to the signing of the Cotonou\nagreements in Benin. This outcome suggests that peace is\nbeginning to return to that country. Niger supports action by\nthe Economic Community of West African States with a\nview to securing respect for these agreements by all the\nparties concerned.\nWe also welcome the talks in El Ayoun on Western\nSahara. These talks open up new prospects for a final\nsettlement of this conflict, which has lasted far too long.\nNow more than ever before, other regions of the\nAfrican continent require our close attention and action.\nThis is true of Angola, Mozambique and Somalia.\nRepresentatives may rest assured that Niger unreservedly\nsupports all Security Council resolutions that promote the\nreturn of peace to this long-suffering country.\nI wish now to praise Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\u2019s\ndynamic work towards elimination of the numerous sources\nof tension and conflict in Africa and in the world at large.\nWe wish to thank him, in particular, for the insights and\nthoughts contained in the report entitled \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\". We have familiarized ourselves with the many wise\nproposals that the Secretary-General has put forward in that\ndocument. In particular, we share his views regarding\npreventive diplomacy. It was in this spirit that the\nOrganization of African Unity, at its 29th summit meeting in\nCairo, equipped itself with machinery for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts in Africa.\nAway from the African continent, we welcome the\nsigning by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel,\non 13 September 1993 in Washington, of the agreements on\nmutual recognition and on autonomy for the Gaza Strip and\nJericho.\nWe hope that the momentum for peace that is\nbeginning in certain parts of the world will move to Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, which has suffered far too long.\nIt is on this hopeful note that I shall conclude my\nstatement. But first I should like, on behalf of Niger, to\nwelcome the arrival in the great family of nations of Eritrea,\nthe Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, the\nCzech Republic, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and the Slovak Republic. Their presence among\nus strengthens the universality of the United Nations and\ntestifies to the value of the Organization\u2019s action in support\nof the widespread progress of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nMauritius delegation, it is my pleasure and privilege to\nextend to Mr. Insanally our heartiest congratulations on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session. We wish to assure him and members of his\nBureau of our full cooperation and support in the tasks that\nlie ahead of them. The election of a representative of\nGuyana to the presidency of this Assembly is gratifying in\nmore ways than one and underlines the fact that even the\nsmallest of States belonging to this Organization has a role\nto play on the international scene and will not shy away\nfrom any responsibility that may be entrusted to it, however\nbig the challenge.\nWe should also like to place on record our appreciation\nof his predecessor for the commendable manner in which he\nconducted the deliberations of the forty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly.\nMauritius is pleased to welcome into the family of the\nUnited Nations its new Members: Andorra, the Czech\nRepublic, Eritrea, Monaco, the Slovak Republic and The\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We are hopeful\nthat these new Members will uphold and strengthen the\nideals enshrined in the Charter of this Organization and we\nlook forward to their active participation in our deliberations.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 29\nIt is important, in my delegation\u2019s view, that I address\nin the first instance an issue of prime concern to the\nfunctioning of our Organization. There is at present much\ndebate and ambivalence about the future role and\norientations of the United Nations. While it is generally\naccepted that the United Nations as a multilateral\norganization should adapt to and reflect the profound\nchanges that have taken place since its founding,\nconsiderable doubt exists on what proposals and practical\nmeasures should be adopted to make the United Nations\nsystem more effective and forge it into a relevant instrument\nof global governance. Is the United Nations able to respond\nto the new demands, opportunities and challenges that have\nemerged especially since the end of the cold war and still\nremain true to its Charter? That the United Nations in\nrecent years has already been able to play a more central\nrole in world affairs and assume greater responsibilities in\nthe wide range of social and political problems is an\nindication that it has earned the growing acceptance of the\nworld community as a legitimate vehicle for addressing\nsignificant global issues.\nHowever, beneath the prestige of regained moral stature\nand recognition that its ideals and message are still valid is\nthe reality that the United Nations administrative structures\nand institutions are in dire need of reform. The United\nNations system remains ill-equipped for the scope of its\ncurrent operations and activities. The evolving nature of the\nUnited Nations will therefore have a crucial impact on the\nfuture shape and management of the post-cold-war\ninternational economic and political environment.\nThe current debate on revitalization and restructuring\nhinges on whether the United Nations should become more\nfocused or more encompassing. Despite clear\npronouncements for change at the level of the Assembly, the\nSecurity Council, social and economic organs and peace-\nkeeping operations, it is evident that many Member States\nare neither expecting the process to result in any sweeping\nstructural reforms nor contemplating a revision of the\nCharter.\nProgress will therefore need to come from within, the\nresult of a balancing act between divergent interests and\npolitical considerations. It would be unfortunate, however,\nif such an agreement were merely a reflection of a lowest\ncommon denominator rather than the product of genuine\ncooperation.\nI concede that the reform of such an Organization is no\neasy task and requires the assistance of one and all. Last\nyear the Mauritius delegation to the General Assembly\ncommended the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts at reforming our\nOrganization. I should like to reiterate our appreciation for\nwhat has been achieved so far and our support for the work\ncurrently being undertaken by the Secretary-General to\nrevitalize the United Nations.\nI remain convinced that the emerging global situation\nhas brought the objective of restructuring the United Nations\nsystem within reach. Such reform should, in the end, cater\nfor the aspirations of the peoples of this world and enable\nthe Organization to respond favourably to the emerging new\nexpectations.\nThe General Assembly, we believe, ought to be\nencouraged, by its increased membership and a general trend\ntowards democratization, to assume a more preponderant\nplace in the affairs of the Organization. It should strengthen\nits policy-making role, especially in the social and economic\nfields, so as to exercise greater balance with the Security\nCouncil, whose mandate is now expanding beyond the\ntraditional delineation of threats to peace and security into\nsuch areas as human-rights violations and humanitarian\nassistance, through preventive diplomacy and innovative\npeace-keeping operations. Thus, while remaining the crucial\nforum for discussion, the General Assembly would increase\nits capacity to respond to major problems and take\ninitiatives.\nOn the other hand, greater consensus among its\nmembers has enabled the Security Council to assert its\nauthority and break new ground in authorizing the use of\nforce under Chapter VII of the Charter - for example, in\nSomalia, where domestic jurisdiction would normally apply,\nor Yugoslavia, through preventive action. The Council has\nalso had more frequent recourse to sanctions, using them on\nfive occasions since 1990. The intensification of the United\nNations presence has undeniably enhanced the reputation of\nthe Organization. But it has also raised questions about the\nCouncil\u2019s composition and apprehension over its decision-\nmaking process.\nThe new responsibilities and importance assumed by\nthe Council would justify, in our view, some form of\nenlargement to reflect the new level of membership of the\nUnited Nations. A more representative Council would earn\nrecognition and legitimate acceptance and be able to take\naction quickly and effectively with the imprimatur of\nfairness.\nThe Council could, we believe, withstand changes and\nstill retain its main executive function, while improving at\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe same time its coordination with other United Nations\nbodies, such as the General Assembly.\nPeace-keeping has become one of the major\nresponsibilities of the Council. The rapid expansion of\npeace-keeping operations and the huge involvement of\nUnited Nations personnel in this area have boosted\nconfidence in the Organization and given it a higher\ninternational profile. Unfortunately, peace-keeping is also\nbecoming a heavy burden in terms of financial and human\nresources, which threatens to curtail the Organization\u2019s\ninvolvement in other priority areas. Peace-keeping should\nnot be confined merely to narrow security objectives,\nexcluding broader considerations of non-military threats to\nsecurity.\nThe Security Council has, in fact, special responsibility\nin shaping the future of peace-keeping as an effective\nsafeguard in areas of conflict, or potential conflict, in\nvolatile domestic or regional situations where major threats\nto international peace reside today.\nHowever, as the Secretary-General notes in his report\non the implementation of the recommendations of his\n\\\"Agenda for Peace\\\",\n\\\"Peace-keeping is in a state of rapid evolution as the\nUnited Nations is asked to undertake increasingly\ncomplex and dangerous tasks.\\\" (A/47/965, para. 26)\nAs the mandate of peace-keeping operations extends beyond\ntheir traditional domain into such areas as electoral\nassistance, humanitarian relief activities, human-rights\nmonitoring, assistance for nation-building, border-monitoring\nand sanctions enforcement, clearer peace-keeping guidelines\nand standards, based on properly defined mandates and\nadequate financial support, become essential. Within the\nparameters of fundamental principles and their interpretation,\npeace-keeping operations should be designed to work. The\nUnited Nations has made good use of the lessons of concrete\nand painful experience.\nMauritius, for its part, would like to suggest that when\ncarrying out the reform exercise we should not only address\nthe issues of financial resources or expansion of the\nmembership of the Security Council, but also look at matters\nof concern raised in other forums and their attendant\nconsequences for this Organization. We should, hence, not\nfail to give due attention to the principles contained in the\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation, adopted\nat the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly,\nespecially with respect to the rejuvenation of equitable\neconomic growth and development. We must bear clearly\nin mind other new and globally agreed programmes, such as\nthe New Agenda for the Development of Africa, Agenda\n21, which came out of the Rio Conference, and the\nrecommendations of the second World Conference on\nHuman Rights.\nAny changes in the structure of the United Nations\nshould be the product of as large a consensus as possible, in\norder to preserve the credibility of our Organization, and in\nthis task we must be guided inexorably by the spirit of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nHowever, while we uphold this spirit, it is our opinion\nthat serious consideration should be given to a review of the\nprovisions of the Charter. A rereading of the Charter would\nenable us to look anew at its contents and allow us to\npropose amendments in the light of new world realities. I\nalso urge that the Assembly insist on greater clarity in its\nresolutions. This will certainly facilitate action and prevent\ntime lost discussing varying interpretations of resolutions.\nNo doubt, one of the most striking events since the last\nsession of the General Assembly has been the second World\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June of this\nyear. The Conference was an opportunity to review the\nevolution of the attitudes of the peoples of the world towards\nthe upholding of the rights and dignity of man since the first\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, which was held in\nTehran in 1968. The quarter of a century that separates the\nholding of these two Conferences has witnessed a lot of\nchanges, notably the assertion of those States which emerged\nfrom the demise of colonization.\nIn Vienna, both the old and the new players in the\nworld\u2019s human rights forums were able to put forward their\nconcerns and aspirations. The discussions, though not\nalways easy, had the advantage of being frank. We in\nMauritius firmly believe that the end result of the\nConference will be beneficial to the protection of the rights\nof the individual. We must see to it, however, that the\nprovisions of the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action are\nimplemented and do not become mere additional documents\nin the international archives. In this context, I wish yet\nagain to make a special appeal to this Assembly for a\nsubstantial increase in the resources of the Centre for Human\nRights to enable it to attend to its responsibilities with\nconsistency and efficiency and thus contribute more\neffectively to the universal upholding of human rights.\nMauritius wishes to reiterate, in the most forceful\nmanner possible, its support for the recommendation of the\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 31\nsecond World Conference on Human Rights that this\nAssembly address urgently the need to establish a post of\nUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. It is\nour sincere hope that a favourable decision will be reached\nto reflect the wishes of the peoples of the world. Such an\noffice would play the necessary role of coordinating United\nNations work on human rights and would be the focal point\nfor upholding human rights norms.\nIn keeping with its stand on human rights issues,\nMauritius would also like to state its support for the\nresponsibilities assigned to the International Tribunal for the\nprosecution of those responsible for the serious crimes\ncommitted against humanity in the territory of the former\nYugoslavia since 1 January 1991. We would like to\ncongratulate all those eminent persons who have been\nelected to sit on this Tribunal and wish them well in their\ndifficult task.\nIndeed, we view with great concern and sadness the\natrocities and untold sufferings endured by the peoples of the\nformer Republic of Yugoslavia, particularly the children.\nLet the impartial conclusions of the Tribunal serve as a\nlesson to those who believe they can get away with such\ndegrading actions, such disrespect for human life. The\nseriousness and steadfastness with which the Tribunal carries\nout its duty will bear witness to the fact that the world\ncommunity does not remain insensitive and will not be\ncomplacent in the face of such despicable and reprehensible\nacts wherever and whenever they occur. Yet as this century\nof our so-called civilized world fades away, the history of\nBosnia and Herzegovina will be written with the blood of\nthousands of innocent men, women and children.\nEarlier this year the world exulted at the news that\nFrance, the United States of America and the Russian\nFederation had voluntarily extended their moratoriums on\nnuclear testing. It is heartening to observe that 1993 may\nyet be the year when the world will have enjoyed the longest\nrespite from nuclear testing and its attendant consequences,\ndespite the recent disturbing reports pointing to the\npossibility of a resumption of nuclear testing by certain\ncountries. No one doubts the nuclear strength of the\ncountries which have made the moratorium a policy and it\nis to their credit that they have so far not been tempted to\nshow their might by resuming nuclear testing.\nIt is our sincere wish that members of the nuclear club\nadhere to their declared moratoriums, for the resumption of\nnuclear testing by any of those States would jeopardize the\n1995 conference for the review and extension of the\nnon-proliferation Treaty, and would, to our mind, inevitably\nundermine the current efforts aimed at global disarmament.\nIt would be unrealistic on our part not to recognize that,\ndespite uncertainties and ongoing foyers of tension, the\nworld political climate has improved considerably. As cold\nwar rivalry faded, significant bilateral progress was made\nwith the conclusion of the START Treaties and the\nsubsequent agreements for reduction in the respective\nnuclear arsenals of the erstwhile super-Powers. These\npositive efforts were reinforced internationally by the\ndecision of a number of States, including France, China and\nSouth Africa, to adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty at a\ncrucial phase in its review process.\nSuch encouraging developments bode well for all small\nnations like ours whose safety rests upon the foundations of\na reliable collective security system. The recent historic\nagreement between the PLO and Israel and the imminent\nconstitution of a democratic non-racial South Africa should\npave the way for rapid progress towards the denuclearization\nof Africa. Likewise, we note with great satisfaction the\nconsensus emerging in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc\nCommittee on the Indian Ocean to adopt new approaches in\nresponse to the changing international situation and give\nfresh impetus to the process of strengthening cooperation,\npeace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region. The\nincreased participation in this year\u2019s session suggests that the\nGeneral Assembly could accordingly consider broadening the\nCommittee\u2019s mandate.\nSuccess at the regional level depends largely on a\nglobal atmosphere that is conducive to disarmament. We\nwish therefore to reiterate, in this perspective, the importance\nof the current negotiations for the review of the NPT and the\nconclusion of a test ban which should provide non-nuclear\nStates with firm security assurances and address the various\nissues of nuclear proliferation. The threat of the spreading\nof smaller nuclear weapons is compounded by the\navailability of weapons-grade nuclear material produced\nfrom plutonium and highly enriched uranium and the relative\nlack of proper commercial safeguards. To these dangers\nmust be added the potential hazard of nuclear pollution and\nthe dumping of toxic wastes.\nCasting a glance at the world in general, we have\nreason to hope for the advent of peace in the various hitherto\nviolence-ridden regions of our planet in a not-too-distant\nfuture. On the African continent, we note a trend towards\nsolutions to difficult situations. In Mozambique, we salute\nthe signing of the General Peace Agreement for\nMozambique between the Government of Mozambique and\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nRENAMO, the Mozambique national resistance movement.\nWe commend the positive contribution of the United Nations\noperations in Mozambique. We urge the leaders concerned\nto show sufficient flexibility in the current negotiations\naimed at elaborating appropriate electoral laws for the\ncountry.\nSouth Africa is another source of hope. We in\nMauritius have been following very closely the evolution of\ndiscussions in the multiparty negotiating forum and are\nparticularly appreciative of the resolution adopted\nunanimously by the Technical Negotiating Council on\n16 August 1993, which endorses the return of Walvis Bay\nand the offshore islands to Namibia. We have had the\nopportunity to congratulate those responsible for this very\npositive step, which we also applaud as a confidence-\nbuilding measure in that region.\nWe welcome the installation of the Transitional\nExecutive Council and wish to pledge our readiness - as a\ncountry which has made, in its own modest way, its share of\ncontributions to the democratization process across the\nworld - to help in the preparations leading to the elections of\n27 April 1994.\nThe capacity to dismantle apartheid, establish the basis\nof a new constitution by consensus, and agree on an\nelection date within a few years is no mean achievement.\nHowever, whilst many rapid and positive changes are taking\nplace, South Africa continues to be plagued by ceaseless\nviolence. Time and again we have deplored the upsurge of\nviolence which has cost the lives of several of Africa\u2019s most\nillustrious sons, among them the sorely missed Chris Hani.\nWe therefore welcome wholeheartedly the proposal to\nestablish a national peace force in South Africa, made up of\nrepresentatives of all parties, which would be entrusted with\nthe task of preventing violence in particularly volatile areas.\nThe creation of this mechanism shows the determination and\nardent desire of all in South Africa to resolve outstanding\nissues and to proceed as planned for violence-free elections\nin April of next year.\n\nIn Somalia, we have been distressed by the senseless\nkilling of members of the United Nations Forces as well as\nSomali civilians. The skirmishes being witnessed in Somalia\nhave regrettably shifted world attention away from the\nstarving millions to manhunts. Women and children dying\ndaily for want of food have been relegated insignificantly to\nthe backstage. Mauritius would like to call on the leaders of\nthe various Somali factions to revert to the agreement\nreached in Addis Ababa and submit themselves to the peace-\nkeeping process within the context of the recently established\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for the\nPrevention, Management and Resolution of Conflicts. Our\nfervent appeal to all those bent on perpetuating the blood\nbath in Somalia is to heed the concerns of the international\ncommunity and indeed act in the interests of the Somali\npeople rather than in their own selfish interests.\nIn our Indian Ocean region, on an issue of direct\nconcern to us, I am happy to say that meaningful dialogue\non the Chagos Archipelago is taking place with the United\nKingdom authorities.\nWhile we hail the success of the United Nations in\nCambodia, we cannot but decry the atrocious situation in\nAngola, where thousands of lives are done away with daily.\nThe question that must be asked is this: to what end will a\ncountry depleted of its human resources serve those who, in\ntheir desperation to be at the helm of affairs, are ready to\nsacrifice countless lives and lay waste that very country?\nWe exhort Mr. Savimbi and his UNITA to come to terms\nwith reality and accept the will of the Angolan people as\nexpressed through the ballot box.\nOutside the African continent, the Middle East, which\nhas witnessed one of the most bitter conflicts of the century,\nheralds a new era. There is cause for satisfaction in the\nknowledge that the peace process which began at the Madrid\nConference in October 1991 has taken a decisive turn with\nIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\nextending mutual and official recognition to each other. Let\nus hope that the plan for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and\nJericho is but a prelude to Israel\u2019s complete withdrawal from\nthe occupied territories, a sine qua non for a just and durable\npeace in the Middle East.\nAs I said earlier, we have reason to rejoice at the\nthought of more peaceful days in various areas of the world.\nHowever, this prospect is marred by other concerns. In Fiji\nthe long-awaited review of the Constitution has not yet taken\nplace, with the unfortunate result that the electoral system is\nin stagnation. We feel that meaningful changes in the\nConstitution, as promised by the Fijian authorities, will\nrestore confidence in the Fijian community and will bring\nabout smoother relations in the country for the benefit of all.\nMauritius, as a multi-cultural, multi-religious and\nmulti-ethnic society, is willing, in all humility, to share with\nFijian authorities the benefits of its own experience of\nharmonious living and to assist, should it be so wished, in\nthe review of the Constitution.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 33\nWhile there are promising developments in the world,\nthe global economy continues to evoke distress. The long-\nawaited economic recovery in developed countries continues\nto be inconsistent and uneven; global economic stability\nremains more elusive than ever. Economic growth and\ndevelopment proper are the only durable, effective and\nequitable solution to instability and to a host of other\nassociated problems facing the world. We believe, therefore,\nthat it is the concern of the entire world to ponder seriously\na new form of multilateralism which would ensure\nsystematic coordination of policies involving all groups of\ncountries.\nWe believe that the rapid internationalization of the\nworld economy points to the urgency to resume North-\nSouth dialogue constructively and in a spirit of cooperation\nand understanding. This dialogue should become an\ninstrument for the promotion of economic growth in\ndeveloping countries and should address world economic\nproblems practically, instead of remaining a mere slogan\ninterspersed now and again by half-measures aimed more at\nplacating genuine concerns of the South than at evolving a\nworkable long-term policy to bridge the ever-widening gap\nbetween the North and the South with immediate,\nmedium-term and long-term solutions to the exasperating\nproblems that plague most developing countries.\nThe efforts of most developing economies are\ncompromised by the consequences of unbridled\nprotectionism, deteriorating commodity prices, acute debt\nproblems, declining financial flows, poverty and\nunfavourable terms for the transfer of technology. However,\nin the face of the unfair competition that continues to hold\nsway on the international trade scene, we should ensure, for\nexample, that the provisions of the Lom\u00e9 Convention that\nbinds the European Economic Community with the Asian,\nCaribbean and Pacific group of countries are upheld in any\nmultilateral trade negotiations.\nWe in Mauritius are eager for a balanced outcome of\nthe Uruguay Round and have therefore been extremely\ndisappointed at the scant attention paid to the interests of the\ndeveloping countries which are vulnerable to shifts in the\nworld economic order. The ongoing negotiations have\nturned out to be primarily a battle of wits and nerves among\nthe developed countries. We have studied the latest\nproposals from Geneva with attention, and our frank reaction\nis one of consternation and dismay.\nWhat is proposed is a cataclysmic operation which calls\nfor the system to be completely refounded, the structures that\nexist to be razed, and the groupings within which we\nconduct our foreign trade to be dismantled. What is\nsuggested by the major negotiators is a change so convulsive\nthat only the most resilient economies will emerge\nunscathed.\nMauritius considers this situation to be most unfair,\nunjust and, above all, counter-productive, in the long run.\nMauritius, which has an open economy banking on export-\nled growth, is in favour of free trade and liberalization of\nexchanges with due regard for the acquired rights of various\ngroups of developing countries. We believe, however, that\nsuch change must come about through an orderly,\nevolutionary process that will give ample time for\nadaptation, rather than through external imposition which has\nlittle consideration for factors other than economic. We\ntherefore appeal to all contracting parties to strive earnestly\nfor a conclusion of the Uruguay Round that will take into\naccount the difficulties of the developing countries and the\nparticular situation of small island States.\nBoth the United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development and the General Assembly have recognized\nthe specificities of small island States and the attention that\nshould be given to them in view of the special case they\nconstitute in the interrelation of environment and\ndevelopment. These States are characterized by their limited\nsize in relation to the length of their coastline, limited\nnatural resources, relative geographical isolation, extremely\nfragile and vulnerable ecosystem and a vast expanse of seas\nforming part of their territorial limits. For small island\nnations the ocean and the coastal environment are hence of\nprimary importance and constitute a basic development\nresource.\nThe record of the United Nations in the social and\neconomic fields is a mixed one. Its contribution to global\nawareness and respect for human rights and democratic\nvalues is undisputed. The Rio and Vienna Conferences were\nlandmarks of global cooperation, despite divergent\nperceptions on the strengthening of relevant institutions and\nadoption of concrete measures.\nSuch cooperation could in our view be developed by\nmaintaining a strong role for the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment and by choosing a feasible and incremental\napproach to implementing the commitments made by\nGovernments under Agenda 21. In this regard, we look\nforward to the fruitful preparations for the Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States and its successful outcome in Barbados\nnext year, as the first test case in the ongoing Rio process.\nWe also feel that the General Assembly should seriously\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nconsider establishing an intersessional mechanism to\ncomplete the work of the Preparatory Committee for the\nConference.\nWe, for our part, are as committed as any of those who\nhave made the protection of the global environment their\nleitmotif. We have ratified the Climate Change Convention,\nthe Biodiversity Convention, the Montreal Protocol and the\nBasel and the Bamako Conventions, among other\ninstruments. Our concern is to safeguard the world and\nensure the well-being of those who live in it.\n(spoke in French)\nLet me pursue my thoughts on participation by small\nStates in international life by calling attention to the fact that\nin a few weeks Mauritius will have the honour to host the\nfifth Summit of French-speaking Countries and by saying a\nfew words about the two principal themes that will be\naddressed by Heads of State or Government of countries that\nshare the use of the French language: human rights and\ndevelopment; and unity in diversity.\nThose timely questions illustrate our concerns at a time\nwhen the world is undergoing profound change and when\nmost of our countries continue to face challenges of\ndevelopment. My country wants to make its own\ncontribution, however modest, to the thought of the French-\nspeaking world and the rest of the international community\nso that mankind may see - based on the example of\nMauritius - that peaceful coexistence in a multi-cultural,\nmulti-ethnic, multi-linguistic culture is no mere Utopian idea.\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General, a great friend of\nthe French-speaking world, for having agreed, despite his\nweighty responsibilities, to honour us with his presence at a\nSummit that will bring together, at the highest level,\ndelegations from 47 countries and from all continents.\n(spoke in English)\nAs members will appreciate, we small States are\nnevertheless doing our best to make our share of\ncontributions in order to bequeath to future generations an\nenvironmentally clean world, a world free of want, a world\nfree of war, a world where peace and harmony will prevail.\nCan we expect the same from those with mightier resources?\n"

We\nare convinced that your wisdom and your political and\ndiplomatic experience will enable you to guide the work of\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly in a\nmasterly, successful way.\nWe also congratulate the other members of the Bureau\nof the General Assembly.\nWe wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the skill\nand vision with which he guided the work of the Assembly\nat its forty-seventh session.\nFurther, we express our gratitude to the\nSecretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the vision with which he has\nguided the Organization and for his tireless efforts to ensure\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe Republic of Burundi warmly welcomes the\ncountries that have recently joined the United Nations\nfamily; we welcome the representatives of the Czech\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Eritrea, the Principality of Monaco\nand the Principality of Andorra.\nThe people and the Government of Burundi join the\nrest of the international community in conveying sincere\ncondolences to the Government and the people of India on\nthe earthquake that has struck their country and that has\ncaused the death of some 20,000 people. We assure the\npeople and the Government of India of my country\u2019s\nsympathy and moral support in this harsh ordeal inflicted by\nNature.\nThe people of Burundi, through me, is honoured and\npleased to send a message to the international community\nrepresented here in the General Assembly. That message,\nwhich is being delivered on the morrow of the victory of\ndemocracy in our land, is one of peace, friendship, fraternity\nand solidarity.\nThe beginning of this century was marked by\ndevastating wars that led to the crystallization and\nbipolarization of international relations. The ensuing cold\nwar, with the two major ideological and military blocs in\nconfrontation, was reflected in many countries by the\nestablishment of totalitarian power. Africa, which was at the\nsame time emerging from the long night of colonialism,\nfound itself unwillingly involved in the dynamics of that\nrationale. Peoples who had theoretically been freed from the\ncolonial yoke nevertheless found themselves, to their great\nconsternation, confronted with authorities that had been\nimposed upon them or established by force, and that were\ndevoid of any legitimacy, just like the colonial order that had\ntheoretically been brought to an end.\nIn that context the rights and freedoms of the human\nperson were openly flouted. The State based on law became\na mirage, the right to life and the growth of the human spirit\na utopian ideal. In their concern to consolidate their power,\nwhich lacked any popular base, some leaders inflamed and\nexploited inherent differences based on ethnicity and\nregionalism, which they imbued with political significance.\nOur country did not escape that state of affairs. The\npast 30 years have been marked by ethnic upheavals that\nhave traumatized our people. In truth, the history of the\npeople of Burundi is replete with tragedies. Political forces\nhave exploited ethnic differences with impunity and have\nfought to control the State for their own interests.\nOutright crimes against humanity have been committed\nby individuals and by organized groups, some of which have\nenjoyed the protection and blessing of the State, which lent\nitself to the perpetration of such base actions. That sowed\nmistrust and suspicion among the ethnic groups in our\ncountry, thus traumatizing the people and creating unease\nabout the future. So violent did the tragedy become that\nthere were those who wondered how Burundi would ever\nmanage to emerge from the toils of the violence in which it\nhad become enmeshed.\nBurundi\u2019s recent political development demonstrates its\npeople\u2019s ability to shake off those toils and to rid themselves\nfrom their fears.\nThe ideology of human rights and its corollary,\ndemocracy in the management of public affairs, have taken\nthe place of violent, repressive and exclusionary measures to\nsuch a degree that the people of Burundi have gradually\ncome to realize that in order to solve their problems they\nmust turn to a democracy that transcends differences,\ndivisions and hatreds.\nWe made a choice. Today, we are more than ever\nconvinced that that choice was a good one. The people of\nBurundi embarked upon this process, at first hesitant but\nconfident, with of course the inevitable ups and downs, and\nthey succeeded in holding free, just and open elections.\nToday, the people of Burundi are proud, proud of\nhaving managed to overcome the many difficulties and\nobstacles strewn on their path towards democracy and proud\ntoo of being able to take full control over their history in an\nopen, just and equitable way.\nThe date of 1 June 1993 will remain a memorable one\nin our country\u2019s history. On that day, for the first time in\nBurundi\u2019s history, free, pluralist and open elections were\nheld, designed to give the country truly democratic\ninstitutions. The positive manner in which the various\nprotagonists have accepted the people\u2019s verdict demonstrates\nthat the people of Burundi are henceforth convinced that the\npath of democracy - and especially in its electoral aspect, in\nwhich the people\u2019s will is expressed and legitimacy\nconferred - is the only proper way to resolve the problems\nentailed in the access to and exercise of power.\nFurther, the legislative elections of 29 June 1993 were\nto confirm the will of a people desirous of living henceforth\nin peace.\nWe should like to take this opportunity to extend\nheartfelt thanks to all who, from near or far, supported our\ncountry in its march towards democracy. We have greatly\nappreciated the material, technological and financial support\nprovided by friendly countries and international and\nintergovernmental organizations that have enabled us to\norganize in a suitable manner Burundi\u2019s first free, pluralist\nelections.\nThe democratic administration of a society we are now\nin the process of undertaking cannot be viewed as an end in\nitself. Rather, it is a means to consolidate peace, to\nstrengthen confidence among the various components of our\nnation and to accelerate the economic, social and cultural\ndevelopment to which all men aspire.\nToday, therefore, the Government of Burundi is\nbending every effort to achieve the gradual elimination of all\nthe obstacles that have paralysed or retarded the Burundi\npeople\u2019s drive towards growth and overall development. We\nare working towards this end, and we are convinced that\nwith the support of the international community we can meet\nthe challenge.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 3\nIt is at present our most heartfelt hope that the people\nof Burundi will henceforth be safe from ethnic\nconfrontations. We want no more blood shed in ethnic\nconfrontations anywhere in the land, in the homes, in the\nhills, in towns and provinces, in schools and barracks.\nNever again! That is the watchword of the whole of the\npeople of Burundi.\nWe also want the people of Burundi to accept their\nhistory as it is. Mistakes have naturally been made, and\nthere are other serious problems that continue to weigh on\nour democratic process. Nevertheless, they must not\nobstruct or paralyse us. Setbacks and problems exist to be\novercome. Mistakes must be recognized as such and\ncorrected. That is one of the basic tenets for a new Burundi.\nYes, we must accept our history the better to face the\nfuture. We want that future to be a safer and securer one\nfor all. Thus, the Government we formed following the\nelections last June is an open Government. In it, we have\nbrought together people from every ethnic group, from every\nregion of the country and of different political persuasions.\nAll those people from every social background and\ndiffering political persuasions are working together with\nmight and main to ensure that the process of democratization\nin Burundi will be irreversible. We consider that to be the\nbest way to reach our goal, namely, to reconcile the people\nof Burundi with themselves and with their State the better to\ncommit themselves to the battle for their economic, social\nand cultural development.\nGuided by that will, the Government has just proposed,\nand the National Assembly has ratified, an amnesty law\nunder which more than 5,000 of our compatriots - 70 per\ncent of our country\u2019s prison population - are to regain their\nfreedom and thereby take part in building a democratic\nBurundi, confident and more integral.\nWe wish to tell the world that through that amnesty law\nthe people of Burundi mean to make a new start towards a\nbetter development of their destiny and the installation of\npeace in the subregion.\nWhile granting amnesty to those who, at home or\nabroad, have derogated from the fundamental rights of the\npeople of Burundi as a whole and of individual members of\nthat people in particular, we want to accept our history\nwithout thereby becoming its prisoners. Through a national\npardon, we want to establish a context of security for all\nthose in Burundi who, in their hearts or in the eyes of the\nnation, are responsible for acts committed in the course of\npast tragedies. Indeed, given the tragic acts our people have\nknown, sometimes the result of shared responsibilities but\noften arising out of imprecise causes, we must wipe the slate\nclean. We must view the future with greater clarity,\nconfidence and serenity. That is a solid basis for domestic\npeace, but it can also contribute to the restoration and\noptimum consolidation of security and peace in our\nsubregion.\nThe happy outcome of democracy in our country has\nthus become an unprecedentedly powerful catalyst in the\nsettlement of another thorny problem affecting our\nsubregion. I refer to the question of refugees, of whom\nthere are some 200,000. These compatriots who are victims\nof tragedies of the past three decades and who have been\nforced to stay in exile, seeking refuge in neighbouring\ncountries here and there throughout the world, have had their\nhopes rekindled. For them - and they are perfectly right -\nthe triumph of democracy has removed the essential reason\nfor their leaving their country. Today they have chosen to\nreturn to their homeland, which welcomes them with open\narms.\nBefore talking about the conditions that will have to be\nmet before these compatriots can be assured of a safe return,\nI should like first to discharge the duty of thanking all\ncountries, particularly our neighbours Tanzania, Rwanda\nand Zaire, and all the international organizations, especially\nthose in the United Nations system, and in particular the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\nthat for some 20 years have enabled them to continue to feel\nlike human beings.\nThe Government of Burundi must now continue this\nprocess by ensuring the happy return and the effective and\ndignified reintegration of these citizens into the country\u2019s\neconomic, social and cultural life. To succeed, we shall\nhave to mobilize many material and financial resources to\nmeet emergency needs and satisfy long-term requirements.\nWe make an earnest appeal to the international community\nto provide such support as we engage in this highly\nhumanitarian process.\nWe are faced with a massive and spontaneous return of\nBurundi refugees from neighbouring and distant countries.\nWe are honoured and filled with joy at the confidence and\nspontaneity of our compatriots. At the same time, lack of\nthe means and the infrastructure that we need to cater for\nthem causes us deep concern. We are now identifying in\ndetail all the steps that will have to be taken if we are to\norganize, before next December, a conference to inform\nsponsors to help finance this large-scale operation.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn the meantime, we are using the modest means at our\ndisposal, while relying on national solidarity and, especially,\non the laudable intervention of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, to whom we again express our\ndeep gratitude. Pending the establishment, in the receiving\nareas, of a medium-term plan for the gradual repatriation and\nreabsorption of these returnees into a global, integrated\ndevelopment programme, we have just published an\nemergency plan to deal with the arrival of 50,000 people\nbetween now and February 1994. The latter, because of the\nprecariousness of their conditions, are returning right away.\nThis will enable us, having secured the necessary means, to\nalleviate their suffering and to accord them the dignity to\nwhich they are entitled.\nIn the economic field, our major concern is to ensure\na just and appropriate link between human, natural and\nfinancial resources so that we may provide the goods and\nservices to satisfy the constantly increasing needs of our\npopulation. Development of the rural sector will require\nspecial attention from the public authorities, given the fact\nthat more than 90 per cent of our population live in the\ncountryside. We want to modernize the rural economy, and\nthe spirit of enterprise, self-improvement, research and\ncreativity will play a very important part in the economic\napproach of the new era.\nA conference of donors to help finance Burundi\u2019s sixth\nfive-year economic and social development plan will be\norganized in the near future. We believe that the\ninternational community will give us its usual support and\nthat the resources necessary for implementation of the plan\nwill be forthcoming.\nMoreover, the Government of Burundi will pursue the\nstructural adjustment programme, with the support of the\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nDevelopment of the private sector will be encouraged, and\nnon-strategic public enterprises will be progressively\nprivatized, either in terms of property or in terms of\nmanagement.\nWithin the framework of liberalization of the Burundi\neconomy, the Government will reinforce the free-trade zone\nfor the purpose of diversifying exports. We invite investors\nwho are so inclined to come and operate in Burundi, where\nthe current political and social environment, the free-trade\nzone and the investment code are very favourable to\nbusiness.\nIn the social and cultural field, we shall promote the\nwork ethic and ingenuity and, thereby, commit ourselves to\npositive values, in keeping with our traditions and culture.\nAs we have already pointed out, democracy in Burundi\nis a living reality that has to be consolidated. This new\npolitical situation will change relations between Burundi and\nits foreign partners. That is why, henceforth, my country\u2019s\nforeign policy will be based on the following guiding\nprinciples: good-neighbourliness and effective cooperation;\nnon-interference in the affairs of other States; the\nconsolidation of peace through respect for and the promotion\nof the rights and freedoms of the human person; mutually\nadvantageous international cooperation based on\ninterdependence and solidarity between peoples and nations;\nregional integration against the background of the emergence\nof free-trade zones in which there is no place for selfish\nnational purposes; and, finally, integration of the Burundi\neconomy into the world economy.\nWe believe that respect for these principles will not\nonly strengthen the determination of the Government of our\ncountry to implement a foreign policy in keeping with the\ndemands of its domestic policy but also foster harmonious\nrelations with our foreign partners.\nWe realize that, without development, there can be no\nhealthy democracy. Democratization is therefore a\ncontinuing process, a process that never ends - to the extent\nthat it is not enough to create or reform political institutions;\nthat it is especially necessary to resolve substantial problems,\nparticularly those related to health, nutrition, education,\nhousing and people\u2019s general well-being.\nSolutions must be found for these problems, but at the\nsame time we must confront challenges linked to them - for\nexample, population growth, the steady drop in the prices of\nraw materials, the poor performance of our economies, the\nweight of external debt, natural disasters and endemic\ndisease, especially malaria and AIDS, which have become a\nreal scourge, principally in Africa.\nThe survival of democracy on our continent will depend\non our achieving a just balance in international economic\nrelations. The security and stability that are indispensable if\nsound democracy is to be guaranteed will remain under\nthreat so long as the problems of debt and hunger - in a\nword: development - are not attacked head on.\nThe international community would therefore be failing\nin its duty were it to permit the gap between the prosperous\ncountries of the North and the poor countries of the South to\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 5\nremain indefinitely. Thus, we appreciate the various\ninitiatives to reduce the burden of foreign debt on the\ndeveloping countries. We believe that economic recovery in\nAfrica will be achieved, in particular, when external debt is\nsubstantially cancelled and additional financial resources\nprovided. Is it right that financial flows from the South to\nthe North should be greater than those from the North to the\nSouth, as is the case today? This is a bitter reality, which\nrequires of us profound changes. Thus, the United Nations\nmust do all in its power to rethink cooperation machinery,\nwith a view to coming up with a solution that will reverse\nthe tendency towards the impoverishment of Africa in\nparticular.\nDespite the problems we have just mentioned, we must\nnot allow ourselves to be discouraged. Our efforts at\ndemocracy and development go hand in hand with a sincere\nsearch for regional solidarity, in the first place, and then for\ninternational solidarity. We know full well that, while\nimposed choices are intolerable, it would be an aberration if\nwe were to fail to act together. It is by combining and\nharmonizing their forces that States can make the best of\ntheir advantages. Burundi must not stand aside from this\nmovement towards solidarity. In our subregion, Burundi\nwill commit itself to the promotion of various types of\ncooperation with its neighbours.\nWe intend to strengthen existing instruments in the\ncontext of that cooperation, such as the Economic\nCommunity of the Great Lakes Countries, the Kagera River\nBasin Organization and the Preferential Trade Area, with a\nview to the gradual establishment of a free-trade zone. The\nGovernment of Burundi will spare no effort to spark\nsubregional cooperation aimed at increased well-being for\nour peoples.\nIt is high time that we in the third world engaged in\nsome self-examination. It is high time that we grew out of\nlooking only outwards. We must explore our own capacity\nfor self-development: development directed at ourselves and\nmaintained by ourselves. We must learn to plan and manage\nbetter. Above all, we must learn to work better, to work\nprofitably: all of us, from the humblest peasant to the\nloftiest dignitary. Africa is overflowing with wasted or\nunexploited potential. We must contemplate a development\nfor ourselves, a development adapted to our needs and\nmaking use of our assets. International solidarity can be\neffective only in the radically new context where we take\nresponsibility for ourselves and where exchanges are\nmutually advantageous.\nThe world is radically changing. Peoples aspire to\ngreater freedom and dignity. Mankind needs to make\nenormous efforts to overcome the obstacles on its path:\npoverty, war, famine, sickness, the destruction of the\nenvironment, overpopulation. These are all challenges\nfacing our planet.\nThe detente and the will for peace that characterize\nrelations between the major Powers following the cold war\ncan make it possible to achieve global security,\nunderstanding and cooperation; they affect the need for\npolitical settlements of the conflicts that have broken out in\nmany parts of the world. Burundi advocates dialogue and\njoint efforts to end disputes, and we can only welcome these\npositive developments in international relations.\nBut internationally speaking we are at the turning point\nbetween two eras. The era of the cold war and a bipolar\nworld has ended. But today the world is newly assailed, and\nthe inevitable seismic shock waves are shaking the global\nvillage. Peoples and nations everywhere are seeking new\nguidelines for building the new world order that has been so\nlate in coming.\nAncient rivalries we thought had been overcome are\nagain rising to the surface and are disturbing balances\nachieved at great cost. On the threshold of the twenty-first\ncentury, Europe has been jolted by separatist nationalism.\nThe plan to build a communal supranational political entity\nis not exempt from the harsh test posed by the eruptions\ntaking place in the multinational States of the long-standing\ndemocracies. The situation in the former Yugoslavia speaks\nunfortunate volumes in this regard.\nAfrica is being undermined by areas of disturbing\ndestruction. It has been all the more marginalized since the\nend of the division of the world into two blocs because it is\nno longer a bargaining chip. Where else in the world are\nthere so many countries without State authority, without\nsocial organization? Where else are there so many\nfratricidal wars with no solution in view? Somalia, Liberia,\nAngola, Mozambique and Rwanda are all loci of tension\nwhere instability threatens Africa as a whole, as well as\nworld peace.\nBurundi firmly supports the resolution of conflicts in\nthe framework of regional and subregional organizations.\nHence, we praise the efforts of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) and subregional organizations in Africa to\narbitrate conflicts and help the parties to find negotiated\nsolutions to their disputes.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn connection with the prevention of conflicts and with\nconfidence- and security-building among the States of our\nsubregion, we have established a permanent consultative\ncommittee on security questions in Central Africa, with the\ncooperation of the United Nations. In the committee\nmeetings already held, a common determination has emerged\nto establish a confidence-building machinery, and to limit\nweapons in order to benefit the development and well-being\nof the peoples of the subregion.\nMoreover, Burundi welcomes United Nations action,\nwhich despite many difficulties continues to play a role and\nto achieve success. A recent example is that of Cambodia,\nwhere a Government of National Unity has just been formed\nafter a long process carried out under United Nations\nsupervision. The United Nations is doing all it can to\nrestore order in Angola, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.\nWe urge the United Nations to proceed on this path.\nWe hail the historic agreement recently signed at\nWashington between the State of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization. This development is an important\nmilestone in the settlement of the Palestinian problem.\nBurundi attaches great significance to this event, which\nwithout question will set its stamp on the end of the century.\nCloser to home, in Rwanda, Burundi hails and supports\naction taken by the United Nations in cooperation with the\nOrganization of African Unity to guarantee our Rwandese\nbrethren a climate favouring genuine national reconciliation.\nThe deployment of a neutral international force, as requested\nby the two parties, should be arranged as quickly as\npossible. Such a force is among the prerequisites for the\nconsolidation of peace in Rwanda, and hence throughout the\nsubregion - especially in Burundi, where similarities in\nethnic, linguistic and cultural matters place us in a delicate\nposition with respect to the Rwandese political conflict.\nBurundi also welcomes the positive developments in the\nsituation in southern Africa. Negotiations under way among\nthe various political players in South Africa have already\nproduced encouraging results that are strengthening mutual\ntrust. The Government of Burundi was pleased by the\ndecision of the Conference for a Democratic South Africa\n(CODESA) recognizing that Walvis Bay and the surrounding\narea belong to Namibia. That decision marks the total\nindependence of Namibia and is in keeping with the\nconsolidation of peace in the region.\nThat is true also of the decision in South Africa to set\nup a Transitional Executive Council open to all political\ngroups; this will lead to elections next year.\nBurundi enthusiastically welcomes the recent events in\nSouth Africa that enabled the historic leader of the African\nNational Congress of South Africa (ANC), Mr. Nelson\nMandela, to call for the lifting of economic sanctions against\nhis country. Burundi considers that those events are the\nculmination of the first phase of a process that will lead to\nthe emergence in South Africa of a democratic regime free\nof racial discrimination.\nBurundi hopes that the Transitional Executive Council\nwill be able to complete negotiations on the transition to\ndemocracy. That would open new prospects not only for\nsouthern Africa but also for the entire continent, which in\nrecent years has followed with special attention the obstacles\npreventing all the daughters and sons of Africa from\nenjoying their national rights, thus compromising the entire\nnetwork of mutually advantageous relations that could be\ndeveloped between South Africa and the rest of the\ncontinent.\nConcerning the difficulties facing our Organization, it\nis an open secret that we are facing financial adjustment\nproblems. The number of peace-keeping operations, the\nfrequency of special missions, the diversity and the\ncomplexity of prevailing situations all call for greater\nresponsibility in the payment of assessments due the\nOrganization.\nBurundi also encourages the current restructuring of the\nUnited Nations system, which will allow it to measure up to\nthe numerous new tasks awaiting it and enable it to have an\nimage which is a true mirror of the present world.\nOur country praises the exceptional courage and selfdenial demonstrated by the staff of the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. It goes without\nsaying that refugees and displaced persons endure the most\npainful sufferings because of conflicts. The United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees constantly gives them hope\nby providing them with the basic necessities.\nBurundi, as a country that has been sheltering refugees\nbut that also has citizens of its own living in exile, can\ntestify today to its convictions and achievements on the\nquestion of refugees. We are convinced that only the\nrepatriation and reinstallation of refugees and displaced\npersons can remedy the problem, which has become\nworldwide in scope and difficult to overcome.\nWe would be remiss not to congratulate the\nnon-governmental organizations of the world, which, through\nForty-eighth session - 4 October 1993 7\ntheir actions, have lessened the suffering of millions of men,\nwomen and children in distress.\nIn order to be lasting and irreversible, the democratic\nreforms chosen by our populations must have international\nsupport, because, indeed, democracy against a backdrop of\nsocial unrest, unemployment and poverty runs the risk of\nbeing just a caricature.\nFrom this rostrum, in the same way that we called on\nthe international community to witness our democratic\ninstitutions, we would like to ask it to support our efforts\nthrough international cooperation based on interdependence\nand solidarity among peoples and nations.\nThe economic situation in the world today constitutes\nfor us a subject of deep concern. The developed countries\nhave been hit by a recession, and it is not easy to overcome\nit. After years of more or less favourable economic\nconditions, growth in their economies is now slowing down.\nShort-term projections are not very encouraging either.\nUnemployment has reached disturbing proportions, thereby\ncausing a resurgence here and there of xenophobia and\nmicronationalism, victims of which are for the most part\nforeigners who have become true scapegoats for the ills that\nare distressing the societies in the developed countries.\nThe developing world is the most severely affected in\nterms of the well-being of its population. While South-East\nAsia and Latin America have positive economic indicators,\nwe must note that Africa is going through a difficult period\nand that the stakes are high. The drop in export earnings,\nlinked to the undervaluing of raw materials, weighs heavily\nupon the external debt that today so hinders the freedom of\naction of most African countries. The outlook for recovery\nand growth in the short term will likely remain bleak for the\nAfrican continent.\nWe would like to recall, however, that there have been\ndelays in the implementation of the New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, adopted by the General\nAssembly two years ago. Similarly, progress achieved in\nimplementing the New Agenda for the 1990s in favour of\nthe least-developed countries is still not up to the\nexpectations of our populations.\nThe International Conference on African Development\nis currently being held in Tokyo. We sincerely thank the\norganizers of that meeting, especially the Government of\nJapan. We wish that Conference success, and we also hope\nthat it will lead to concrete commitments on the part of the\ndonors to help us recover and to develop on the basis of our\nown needs and priorities. Burundi is represented in Tokyo\nat a high level, and it will make its contribution to achieving\nthe goals of that Conference.\nObstacles to healthy international economic cooperation\nare still numerous and of many kinds. The external debt\ncrisis remains a major hindrance to the recovery of our\neconomies. The main creditors must make greater efforts to\nease the weight of this debt, the servicing of which is a\nheavy burden on the meagre export earnings of our\ndeveloping countries. At this time, we would like to express\nour deep gratitude to friendly countries which have already\nundertaken measures - or are in the process of so doing - to\nreduce or cancel the debt which we owe them. We ask them\nto take relevant measures to give a strong boost to\ndevelopment financing, the drying up of which concerns us.\nIn this regard, Burundi places great hope in traditional\nsources of financing, the funds for which have been\nincreased. But we also place great hopes in the Global\nEnvironment Facility. Our delegation would like from this\nrostrum to repeat the need for rapid conclusion to the\nnegotiations on the restructuring of that fund so that it may\nreflect its true world calling with regard to its composition\nand to transparent management and democratic management\nin its functioning. Similarly, it is also important for the\nCommission on Sustainable Development to move from\nrhetoric to an operational phase.\nThe series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT) negotiations ought to have been concluded in 1991,\nbut they continue to run up against a number of\ndisagreements which are causing major concern in the world\neconomy, in particular with respect to the future of the\nmultilateral trading system. We urgently appeal to the\nprincipal protagonists to show political will sufficient to\nbring about a favourable ending to the Uruguay Round. The\ninternational community would in no way benefit from a\ntrade war. There would be no winner and no loser in that\nwar.\nEach year the United Nations enjoys greater\nparticipation at the level of Heads of State and Government.\nThis is due to the fact that they firmly believe in the\nirreplaceable role of this Organization in respect of the\nbalance and functioning of the world. We firmly believe in\nthis Organization, and therefore we permit ourselves the\nliberty of hoping for the promotion of international\ncooperation which takes account of the diversity of each\ncountry and which is committed to complementary actions\nwith shared and fully assumed responsibility.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe United Nations indeed is an Organization of\npowerful countries and weaker countries. Here, therefore,\nwe find the principles of justice, transparency and solidarity\nin international affairs as something which must be\nrespected, so that no State need feel excluded or bullied\nbecause of its size. Rather, each State should feel protected\nagainst insecurity and arbitrariness, against hunger, against\npoverty, against epidemics of all kinds.\nIt is true, and we strongly emphasize this, that the\nweaker countries must not always put forward their\nweakness as a pretext to demand or to call for protection or\nassistance from the international community. They too must\ntake charge of their own destinies. They must organize\nthemselves in such a way that the United Nations or other\norganizations would intervene only to give them support for\na self-centred and self-supported development programme.\nIt is our deepest wish that this world Organization that\nwe share would continue to pursue its ideals and to achieve\nits goals. We would wish that international solidarity might\nbe a genuine reality and that the relations among States\nmight henceforth be based on a more just and more\nequitable economic and political order.\nIt is our hope to see our Organization help the poorest\npopulations on our planet avoid hunger, poverty and wars.\nLong live the United Nations!\nLong live international solidarity!\n"

In April of this year it was with warmth and high\nesteem, and moved by a desire to enhance Viet Nam\u2019s\ncooperation with the United Nations, that our Government\nand people welcomed the Secretary-General in our country.\nWe wish to congratulate the new Members of our\nUnited Nations family.\nIn the year since the previous session of our General\nAssembly, the world has offered us a chiaroscuro picture of\nopportunities intermingled with challenges, of hopes mixed\nwith anxieties. The threat of a global war of annihilation\ncontinues to recede, and we are witnessing an increasing\ntrend towards dialogue and cooperation, in new forms and\nthrough new mechanisms, in different regions and on a\nworld-wide scale. The progress towards restoration of peace\nin a number of places, especially in Cambodia and the\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMiddle East, brings glad tidings to the whole world and\ndemonstrates that in our day and age it is still possible,\nthrough peaceful negotiations, to settle conflicts that were\nonce fierce and protracted.\nHowever, humanity\u2019s conscience and reason remain\nprofoundly disturbed by the bloody conflicts which are\ninflicting death and pain on peoples and provoking regional\nand international instability, by potentially explosive\ntendencies to increase armaments in certain parts of the\nworld, by the widening gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping world and by other important and pressing\nproblems of a global nature, such as demographic explosion,\nenvironmental degradation, dangerous diseases, transnational\ncrime, and so on.\nIn an unstable world whose evolution is fraught with\ncomplexities, the United Nations, while taking account of the\ndirect responsibility of nations concerned, is facing major\nchallenges in the discharge of its primary responsibility,\nnamely the restoration and preservation of peace and\nstability. Never before has the United Nations been present\nand active in so many hot spots across the continents as it is\ntoday. In this regard the Secretary-General has given us a\ncomprehensive approach to the problem in his report \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\". (A/47/277)\nIt is the earnest desire of the people of Viet Nam that\npeace, closely linked with national independence and\nsovereignty, be primary components of the new world order.\nWe endorse the view expressed in the report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/48/1)\nthat\n\\\"States and their sovereignty are increasingly\nrecognized as indispensable building-blocks of\ninternational order and problem-solving\\\". (A/48/1,\npara. 13)\nRespect for the national independence, sovereignty and\nidentity of each country, the strengthening of international\ncooperation, and the settlement of disputes through peaceful\nnegotiations and mutual accommodation, considering peace,\nstability and cooperation to be the fundamental, long-term\ninterest of each State and of the international community:\nall these are guiding principles in inter-State relations,\nprinciples that the United Nations and its Member States\nmust respect. The Security Council is vested with the\nprimary responsibility for the activities of the United Nations\nin respect of the restoration and safeguarding of peace. This\nmission, however, devolves not solely on the Security\nCouncil but on all nations. Member States should therefore\nhave a say in determining the objectives and guiding\nprinciples for decisions and actions undertaken by the\nSecurity Council with regard to international peace and\nsecurity. Only by so doing can the United Nations truly be\na universal Organization and a common instrument for the\ncommunity of nation-States. The principles of respect for\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, of\nnon-coercion and non-interference in the internal affairs of\nStates, of attainment of the consent of the parties concerned,\nand perseverance in the settlement of disputes through\npeaceful negotiations: such are the principles that should\ngovern the Security Council\u2019s decisions.\nToday the world is witnessing miraculous advances in\nscience and technology. In that world, however, some\nhundred countries and with them billions of human beings\nare in danger of falling behind in the general advancement\nof mankind, while the wealth and property of the world are\nconcentrated in the hands of a few developed countries. The\ngap in development levels is steadily widening. This,\ntogether with the accumulated external debt burden, has put\ndeveloping countries at a constant disadvantage in\nNorth-South economic and trade relations. This reality\ncarries potential challenges to security and stability, both\nregional and international. We should therefore fully\ncomprehend, now more than ever, the interrelation between\npeace, security and development.\nWe support the proposal for the United Nations to work\nout a comprehensive and effective \\\"agenda for\ndevelopment\\\", considering the implementation of such an\nagenda through enhanced resources as a fundamental factor\nfor the establishment of a new, sound and equitable world\norder. Development programmes of the United Nations and\nassistance from highly developed countries to developing\ncountries, especially poor countries, are undertakings which\ndo not benefit one side only; rather, they are necessary for\nthe overall stability and development of the world and the\nvarious regions as well as of each State. We are of the view\nthat attaching political conditions to development assistance\nand cooperation runs counter to the principle of equality and\nmutual benefit of wholesome international relations.\nOn the other hand, poor countries hope that the rapidly\nincreasing cost of peace-keeping operations will not affect\nthe ability of the United Nations in the field of development\ncooperation, and they wish to see balanced attention on the\npart of the United Nations to both the Agenda for Peace and\nthat for development.\nOne important direction of the United Nations activities\nthat reflect the broadening attention given in this regard by\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 13\nthe international community is the promotion of democracy\nand human rights. The World Conference on Human Rights\nheld in Vienna last June clearly pointed out the close\nrelationship between democracy and human rights. In our\nview, one should accord equal importance to, and promote\nconcurrently, democracy within each country and democracy\nin inter-State relations. Respect for human rights must go\ntogether with respect for equality among States as well as\nbetween the United Nations and Member States. The United\nNations itself needs to reform its organization and mode of\noperation so as to ensure democracy, justice and equality for\nall Member States.\nAn enlargement in the membership of the Security\nCouncil to enhance its representativeness, the promotion of\ngreater transparency in the work of this body of authority\nwithin the United Nations system, the strengthening of the\neffectiveness of the General Assembly, the improvement of\nthe relationship among the United Nations organs, together\nwith perfecting the mechanisms and streamlining the\nmachinery to ensure better efficiency and effectiveness of\nthe United Nations activities - all these are urgent demands\nfacing us as we are approaching the fiftieth anniversary of\nthis Organization. Together with many other countries -\nmember States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries,\nin particular - Viet Nam considers human rights to be\nprimarily the concern and interest of each country, the\npursuit of democracy and human rights in one country to be,\nfirst and essentially, the responsibility of that country and\nnation. At the same time, States may cooperate with one\nanother in the promotion of democracy and human rights on\nthe basis of respect for national independence and\nsovereignty, the right to self-determination, the right of a\nnation to choose its own path of development, in accordance\nwith the purposes and principles set forth in the United\nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand the two basic International Covenants on Human Rights.\nWe consider using imposed standards of human rights and\ndemocracy as preconditions for inter-State cooperation to be\na manifestation of inequality and lack of democracy in\ninternational relations.\nThe Vienna Conference identified areas of agreement\nand at the same time revealed outstanding differences of\nviews on human rights. We hope that, proceeding from the\ncommitment to the common cause of human rights\nprotection and promotion, from the recognition of both the\nuniversality and the specificity of human rights, countries\nwill engage in a dialogue in a spirit of mutual respect with\na view to achieving a unity of purpose in a diversity of ways\nand means of implementation in the field of human rights.\nThe Vienna Conference also put forth recommendations\naimed at consolidating and strengthening the role and\neffectiveness of the United Nations in regard to human\nrights. To achieve this end, it is our view that we should\nmake full use of the relevant existing machinery and\nmechanisms of the United Nations and enhance their\nefficiency and effectiveness. Taking account of the need to\nstreamline its machinery, the Organization must carefully\nscrutinize and weigh any initiative for the establishment of\nnew mechanisms.\nViet Nam is a country that has lived through protracted,\ndevastating wars in which the use of millions of tons of\nbombs, ammunition and toxic chemicals has caused\ndestruction of the environment, misery, loss of life and\nserious consequences for several generations now. It has\nbeen undertaking a process of renewal, overcoming many\ndifficulties and challenges to achieve stability, development\nand integration into the international community.\nLocated in the most dynamic region for development in\nthe world, Viet Nam has both assets and difficulties,\nopportunities and challenges stemming from its specific\nhistorical circumstances, natural conditions and its\ngeopolitical and geoeconomic position. We are now facing\nthe acute challenge of how to overcome, soon, our state of\npoverty and underdevelopment, and join the mainstream of\nprogress in the region. The only way is to tap all domestic\nresources, which, first and foremost, means bringing into full\nplay the dynamism and creativity of every Vietnamese, and\nat the same time expanding international cooperation in\nfriendship with all countries based on the principle of mutual\nrespect for national independence and sovereignty, and on\nequality and mutual benefit.\nThis imperative need impels us to initiate and step up\nefforts towards renewal in every sphere of social life; at its\ncore, this is focused on a market economy and on perfecting\nthe rule of law in a State that is truly of the people, by the\npeople and for the people.\nThe process of renewal focuses on the economic field\nwith a view to developing a multisectoral economy operating\nunder the market mechanism, to establishing an economic\nsystem that is open both domestically and externally, and to\nimproving the functions and management patterns of the\nState. Under embargo conditions, and at a point where\nsources of major assistance from the countries of the Council\nfor Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) are no longer\navailable, the renewal process has helped Viet Nam\u2019s\neconomy overcome the most difficult hurdle and end the\nrecession, reduce and maintain control over inflation, achieve\naverage growth in gross domestic product of 7.2 per cent\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nduring the past three years, 1991 to 1993, accumulate\ninitially modest levels of domestic savings, and gradually\nimprove the life of the people.\nViet Nam has been attracting increasing foreign direct\ninvestment and development assistance. On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Viet Nam, I should like to\nexpress our sincere thanks to various agencies of the United\nNations system, such as the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United\nNations Population Fund, the World Food Programme, the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,\nthe World Health Organization, the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization, the Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific and others, as well as\nmany Governments and non-governmental organizations in\nthe world, for maintaining, resuming and increasing\ndevelopment and humanitarian assistance to Viet Nam.\nWe highly appreciate the timely support extended by\nthe Governments of France, Japan, Sweden and other\ncountries, together with the international financial\ninstitutions, for helping Viet Nam settle arrears with the\nInternational Monetary Fund, thereby creating a\nbreakthrough initiation of credit assistance from international\nmonetary and financial institutions; such assistance is\nabsolutely essential for building up socio-economic\ninfrastructures in Viet Nam.\nOur appreciation goes also to the many companies,\nfrom nearly 50 countries, that have come to Viet Nam for\ninvestment and business cooperation at this initial stage of\nour development.\nIn our journey towards a dynamic and sound market\neconomy that is well-managed at the macroeconomic level,\nand achieving healthy, rapid and sustainable growth aimed\nat achieving the objectives of a prosperous nation, a strong\ncountry and a civilized and equitable society, we still face\nnumerous difficulties, weaknesses and challenges. At this\njuncture, increased assistance from the United Nations,\ninternational financial institutions and non-governmental\norganizations, as well as cooperation and support from\nvarious countries, is extremely valuable and meaningful.\nOn the basis of the fundamental approach of having a\nsocio-economic development strategy up to the year 2000 in\nwhich the human person constitutes both the end and the\ndriving force, Viet Nam is simultaneously carrying out\neconomic reforms and a step-by-step renovation of the\npolitical system in order to promote the rights of people and\ncitizens\u2019 rights, both economic and political, cultural and\nsocial. Strenuous efforts have been made to establish the\nState\u2019s rule of law through the promulgation of the amended\nConstitution of 1992, the election of the new National\nAssembly Legislature, an enhancement of the power and\nresponsibilities of the elected organs and a stepping up of\nthe law-making process.\nIn accordance with our nation\u2019s tradition of\nhumaneness, we stand for abolishing prejudice and\nvengeance, and for looking towards the future. Those\npreviously in the ranks of our adversaries have all been freed\nand given full citizens\u2019 rights. All Vietnamese who wish for\na prosperous and strong Viet Nam, and who respect the\nlaws, will find a place in the great unity of the nation, even\nif they are of different political opinions.\nThe process of renovation and the policy of universal\nnational unity constitute the prime mover for development in\nthe country and at the same time bring into full play the\npotential of Vietnamese overseas to contribute to the\nconstruction of their former homeland.\nViet Nam has concurrently deployed a foreign policy of\nopenness, diversifying and multilateralizing its relations of\nfriendly cooperation with all other countries, thus creating a\nfavourable international environment for our country\u2019s\nrenovation and development.\nIn that spirit, Viet Nam has actively contributed to the\npeaceful solution of the Cambodian question and has\nimplemented the Paris Agreements and cooperated with the\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. We\nhave established relations of good-neighbourliness with\nCambodia in the hope that Cambodia will become a country\nof peace, independence, neutrality and non-alignment that\nentertains friendly relations with other countries.\nWe wish to congratulate the new Government in\nCambodia, and stand ready, together with that Government,\nto settle, jointly, any questions of mutual concern. We\nexpress the wish that the Cambodian Government and the\nUnited Nations will take effective measures to protect\nVietnamese residents living peacefully in Cambodia, and to\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 15\nensure their safety and the same rights and benefits as are\nenjoyed by people from other countries who are resident in\nCambodia.\nViet Nam is sparing no effort in building up friendship\nand cooperation with neighbouring countries and is\npersevering in its policy of peaceful negotiations to find\nsatisfactory solutions to border and territorial disputes at sea\nas well as on land. While working for solutions, all\nconcerned parties should refrain from doing anything that\nfurther complicates the situation and from the use or threat\nof use of force to settle disputes.\nThe fact that relations between the United States and\nViet Nam have not yet been normalized 20 years after the\nend of the war is not normal nor is it in consonance with the\ntrend of our time. With the desire to close the book on the\npast and to look to the future, Viet Nam wishes and stands\nready to normalize relations with the United States on the\nbasis of equality and mutual respect and without\npreconditions. This would meet the aspirations and interests\nof the peoples of the two countries, and would serve peace,\nstability, cooperation and development in the region and\nthroughout the world.\nViet Nam still has tens of thousands of people missing\nsince the war, and their remains have yet to be found; and\nmillions of war victims need help. We are deeply\nsympathetic towards the sentiments of American families\nwhose loved ones went missing in the Viet Nam war, and\nhave cooperated, are cooperating and will continue to\ncooperate actively with the American Government and\npeople on the missing-in-action question. We consider this\na purely humanitarian issue.\nI am confident that the goodwill and conscience of the\nAmerican and Vietnamese peoples, together with the\nimmediate and long-term interests of the two countries, will\nsoon prevail over the existing obstacles so that relations\nbetween the two countries can be normalized.\nAllow me to conclude my statement with the hope that\nthe United Nations will rise to the challenge of seizing the\nopportunities and surmounting the challenges so that it truly\nbecomes an institution to which all Member States entrust\ntheir aspirations and in which their views are heard and their\nactions coordinated. For its part, Viet Nam, in its efforts\ntowards renewal, development and integration with the\ninternational community, will always be a positive factor for\npeace, national independence and social progress, and a\nsincere and reliable cooperation partner in the region as well\nas in the world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset,\npermit me to offer to you, Sir, my delegation\u2019s sincere\ncongratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Your\nprofessional experience as your country\u2019s Permanent\nRepresentative to the United Nations will undoubtedly be an\nasset in our important deliberations.\nWe pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\nfor his dedicated service. We applaud the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his bold and tireless efforts\nto strengthen the world Organization. We warmly welcome\nthe new Members and wish them well.\nA retrospective look at developments since the end of\nthe cold war reveals the complexity of advancing towards a\nnew fabric of international relations. On the one hand, the\nspirit of cooperation and interaction is becoming prevalent.\nThe new democracies are making headway in the face of the\nformidable difficulties of transition. Recent events in Russia\nare ample evidence of this. We are confident that the\ndemocratic forces, led by President Yeltsin, will overcome\nthe present ordeal and succeed in their endeavours. The\nsignificance for the region and the entire world of the\nsuccess of Russia\u2019s reforms can hardly be overemphasized.\n\nFurthermore, solutions are being found even to the most\nprotracted regional conflicts. The recent historic act of\nmutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the interim peace\nagreement are a case in point. We hope that this will lead\nto a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict.\nAn important breakthrough towards democracy and a\nmultiracial society in South Africa has been made. Peace\nand the national reconciliation that had eluded Cambodia for\nso long has been restored to this land of ancient civilization.\nLandmark agreements on the prohibition of chemical\nweapons and on the reduction of nuclear armaments have\nbeen concluded.\nIn the meantime, it is clear that old, deep-seated\nproblems still await solutions and new ones, once held in\ncheck by the circumstances of the time, are emerging.\nIndeed, no tangible progress has been registered in\naddressing the issues of poverty, external debt, drugs,\norganized crime, the widening gap between the affluent and\nthe poor, and environmental crises. Though the cold war is\nover, the \\\"hot wars\\\" have multiplied. Suffice it to mention\nthe continuing tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nSomalia, Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia.\nIt is widely recognized today that the concept of\ndevelopment has acquired a multidimensional character\nencompassing not only economic growth, but also political,\nsocial and environmental aspects. Moreover, greater\nemphasis is being placed on the human dimension of\ndevelopment, as in the final analysis the well-being of\npeople stands as a true measurement of development. We\nbelieve that the United Nations is the only, and irreplaceable,\nmechanism to translate this concept into reality.\nIn this respect, the United Nations-sponsored world\nconferences on population and on women and the World\nSummit for Social Development are called upon to open up\nbetter prospects to that end. No lasting solution to today\u2019s\nvarious problems can be sought unless the developmental\nchallenges are adequately addressed. The concept of\ndevelopment and its practical aspects will certainly be\nenriched by the Secretary-General\u2019s interim report on an\nagenda for development and its upcoming discussion during\nthis session.\nNow is the time resolutely to address the long-standing\nagenda relating to economic disparities between the North\nand the South, including eradication of poverty, debt relief,\nelimination of trade protectionism and an early and\nsuccessful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. In this regard,\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 11\nMongolia welcomes the meeting of the Chairman of the\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of Seven last July in\nTokyo, which represents a first step towards re-launching the\nNorth-South dialogue. My delegation believes it important\nthat following serious consideration by the Assembly, at this\nsession, of the Non-Aligned Movement initiative on the\nreactivation of the North-South dialogue to strengthen\ninternational cooperation for development a positive decision\nbe taken in this regard.\nIt is of signal importance that we maintain the\nmomentum gained at the Rio Conference on Environment\nand Development through effective follow-up, at both the\ninternational and the national level. We commend the\ndynamic role of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment as a central political forum for the monitoring\nand review of the implementation of Agenda 21. Mongolia\nrecently ratified the Convention on Climate Change and the\nConvention on Biodiversity; our national plan of action to\nimplement Agenda 21 is being formulated.\nAs a country where desertification is a major challenge,\nMongolia deems it necessary that a convention on that\nsubject be concluded by 1995.\nMongolia believes that the observance of human rights\nin accordance with universally accepted norms is essential in\npromoting equitable cooperation among States. Respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms can in no way be\nreconciled with biased criteria which divide countries into\nbig and small, developed and underdeveloped, majority and\nminority groups, or along ethnic, racial and religious lines.\nFurthermore, Mongolia proceeds from the premise that\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, as universal values,\ndo not recognize borders.\nIt is of the utmost importance that the Vienna\nConference on Human Rights, held last June, was able to\nreach an agreement on the indivisibility of economic, social,\ncultural, political and civil rights, and on the need to respect\nand implement them on an equal footing.\nIt is gratifying to note that with the demise of the cold\nwar, propaganda on disarmament issues has faded away and\na businesslike atmosphere of cooperation has taken shape.\nEarlier this year the Treaty on substantive reductions of\nstrategic offensive armaments was concluded between the\nRussian Federation and the United States. Also, a\ncommendable initiative with respect to a moratorium on\nnuclear testing took shape. The Geneva Conference on\nDisarmament has decided to commence negotiations on a\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty.\nAs a country uniquely positioned between the two\nnuclear-weapon Powers, Mongolia attaches exceptional\nimportance to this issue. That is precisely why my country\nlast year declared its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\nIn this context Mongolia welcomes the idea of turning\nCentral Asia into such a zone.\nThe issue of the timely and full implementation of\nagreements on the reduction of nuclear weapons and the\ncomplete prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons\nshould not escape the priority attention of the world\ncommunity. The cessation of nuclear-weapon tests and the\nstrict observance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) is acquiring special importance.\nWe support the indefinite extension of the NPT at the review\nConference in 1995. It is of great importance that the\nparties to the Treaty, especially the nuclear-weapon States,\nhonour their commitments and refrain from any action that\nmight undermine it.\nMongolia is entering its fourth year of democratic\nreforms. We, like many others in our position, are facing\nformidable challenges. As an underdeveloped, land-locked\ncountry inadequately integrated into the world transportation\nnetwork, with a high vulnerability to natural calamities,\nMongolia is experiencing added difficulties in its transition.\nIn addition to the political and economic reforms there\nis the onerous task of dealing with spiritual renewal. During\nthe years of the socialist experiment, we Mongols were\nforced to abandon our centuries-old traditions and cultural\nheritage. Suffice it to say that virtually all the houses of\nworship - sanctuaries of spiritual life - over 700 in all, were\ndestroyed, and the traditional script of the Mongols, an\nimportant cultural heritage of mankind, was buried in\noblivion. The task is now to rectify this wrong. This is a\nnation-wide task requiring enormous efforts and resources;\nwe cannot leave it to take care of itself.\nFor all the problems, Mongolia\u2019s democratic reforms\nare steadily gaining ground. The new democratic system of\ngovernance proclaimed in the 1992 democratic Constitution\nis being consolidated. The first-ever direct presidential\nelections, held last June, culminated in the choice of a\nPresident put forward by the new political parties. The legal\nfoundation of the ongoing reforms is being strengthened. It\nhas come to embrace all the key aspects of societal life.\nThe present Government has set itself the task of\nchecking the economic decline within a two-year period.\nAnd the target seems to be within the realm of the possible.\nWe associate these gains primarily with the understanding\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nand support of the international community. In recent years\na donor community in support of Mongolia has emerged. A\ndonor meeting sponsored recently by the World Bank held\nits third round in Tokyo, in which 23 countries and 6\ninternational organizations took part. Grants and soft loans\nby donor Governments significantly help in alleviating the\npresent difficulties, and lay a new basis for future\ndevelopment. In addition, we are keenly interested in\nattracting private-sector investment in Mongolia. This would\nnot only contribute to economic recovery but would also\nhelp make future cooperation with our partners mutually\nadvantageous. The revised Foreign Investment Law creates\nfavourable conditions for such investment opportunities.\nFurthermore, we consider that active involvement in\nregional economic cooperation is an essential factor in\nfulfilling the tasks of transition. With this in mind, we are\ninterested, for instance, in becoming a member of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC). We hope\nthat the States members of that organization will find it\npossible to understand and support our position.\nThe United Nations has emerged as an important focal\npoint of international efforts and has assumed greatly\nincreased responsibilities in the areas of peacemaking,\npeace-keeping and peace-building. The detailed report of the\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization is a lucid\nillustration of that point.\nMongolia fully supports the efforts designed to reform\nthe United Nations, especially to restructure and revitalize\nthe activities of the General Assembly and to ensure that the\ncomposition of the Security Council reflects the changing\nrealities of the day and the dramatically increased\nmembership of the world Organization.\nToday, the United Nations is wrestling with many\nproblems and trying hard to ensure that it is able to meet the\nmany challenges of a rapidly changing world. It goes\nwithout saying that the success of this undertaking will\ndepend on painstaking efforts and, above all, on the political\nwill and greater realism of Member States.\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman, allow\nme at the outset to convey to your Excellency our sincere\ncongratulations and to express our pleasure on your election\nas President of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. I am confident that thanks to your well-known\ncompetence and diplomatic skills, our deliberations will\nreach a successful and meaningful conclusion.\nPermit me also to take this opportunity to extend\nprofound gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr.\nStoyan Ganev, for the exemplary manner in which he steered\nthe work of the forty-seventh session.\nAt this point, I feel it is important to refer to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s comprehensive report (A/48/1) issued in\nSeptember 1993, which dealt with the activities of the\nUnited Nations and the issues and concerns on its agenda.\nIn particular, I wish to refer to paragraphs 353 to 366\nregarding the situation between Iraq and Kuwait.\nWe highly commend the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his great efforts, and we\nshall be looking forward to contributing, with all Member\nStates, in achieving a unified stand that will ultimately lead\nto an integrated approach of coordination, understanding and\ncooperation towards the advancement of our goals of\ndevelopment, peace and stability.\nThis session is convened at a time when the hopes and\nexpectations of all peoples are geared towards a new phase\nof constructive international cooperation between the\nMembers of the United Nations, whose number has been\nincreasing annually. In this context, our country welcomes\nthe admission of Eritrea to the membership of the United\nNations after its accession to independence through its\npeople\u2019s decades-long struggle. Eritrea is a country with\nwhich we have cultural and historical ties and with which we\nshare aspirations after stability and peace. My country also\nwelcomes the admission of the Czech Republic and the\nSlovak Republic as Members of the international\norganization and commends them for having settled their\npolitical problems peacefully and avoided conflicts,\nbloodshed and suffering. We also welcome the admission of\nthe Republic of Macedonia, Andorra and Monaco to our\nOrganization. We are confident that the enlargement of our\ninternational family will give us more strength and\nconfidence in undertaking further innovative international\ncooperation.\nThese countries joined the United Nations after they\nhad gained their independence through the long and painful\nstruggle of their peoples during the cold war and the period\nthat was overshadowed by conflict between the great\nPowers. Today, in the post-cold-war world, we see positive\npolitical developments taking place. In addition to the\nemergence of several sovereign nations, we have seen great\npolitical developments which give us renewed hope that a\nnew world will be established on the basis of brotherhood\nand cooperation instead of conflict and bloodshed, a world\nin which wounds are healed.\nOur presence here underscores our conviction that the\nGeneral Assembly is the unique international forum for\ndiscussing and exchanging views among all Member States,\nregardless of their size or strength. As Members of the\nUnited Nations, we must engage in positive talks and\nnegotiations with the purpose of settling international\nproblems.\nThis forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\nheld under circumstances that should encourage us to\nestablish a set of advanced rules that would govern\ninternational relations. This we should do by taking\nadvantage of the newly acquired capability of the United\nNations to enforce the rule of the law in peacemaking and\npeace-keeping the world over. We are confident that our\nOrganization, which shoulders a heavy burden of serious\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 5\nresponsibility will be able to rise to the challenges that face\nit, so long as the international community continues to be\ncommitted to and redoubles its efforts in supporting the\nUnited Nations and the principles it stands for.\nThere is no doubt that, the success of the United\nNations depends on the coordinated efforts of Member States\nin addressing the outstanding issues and crises which must\nbe solved collectively in the cause of building our new world\norder. There is an urgent need for the organs of the United\nNations to provide positive conditions and effective\nmechanisms before the United Nations is required to deal\nwith any regional or international crisis. We are convinced\nthat no matter how far apart the positions of the parties to\nany conflict are, they will not reject intervention by the\nUnited Nations if the intervention is timely and appropriate.\nIn any case, the tasks of the United Nations should be\nexclusively in the areas of achieving peace and providing\nhumanitarian assistance.\nThe march towards peace between the two peoples of\nPalestine and Israel has just begun. The first important step\nhas been taken towards the comprehensive solution for\nwhich we have long waited. The United Nations which,\ntogether with all its organs, played a prominent role in the\nArab-Israeli conflict should feel a sense of satisfaction at\nwhat has been achieved. However, much work lies ahead\nfor the United Nations and its organs in pursuing and\npreserving this historic agreement that will benefit not only\nthe people of the Middle East, but the entire world as well.\nIt is high time the Palestinian people put behind them their\nlong-drawn-out suffering and looked forward to economic\nand social development under the new world order.\nThe Palestinian-Israeli agreement has paved the way\ntowards other agreements between the Arabs and Israel.\nHowever, we should not be over-optimistic. The residues of\nbitter conflict are there, and unless the peoples and States of\nthe Middle East are fully taken care of, those residues will\nconstitute real obstacles which will make difficult the\nachievement of the goal we all aspire after.\nThe leaders of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples have\nshouldered their responsibilities and have done what was\nexpected of them. Now it is the responsibility of all States\nof the world to maintain and preserve this achievement. It\nis not enough to extend congratulations to those leaders or\nto give them our moral support. The United Nations must\ntake positive complementary steps towards sponsoring\nprojects from which they could benefit economically and\nsocially.\nMy country has voiced its support for this agreement\nbetween Israel and Palestine. We are very pleased to\nwelcome this accord and look forward to a comprehensive\npeace agreement that would guarantee the mutual interests,\nrights and benefits of all parties on the basis of the\nimplementation of United Nations Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) and the\nprinciple of land for peace.\nThus, we call upon all States Members of the United\nNations to support this process. We look forward to any\npositive contribution to any role played by the United\nNations in making the peace we hope for.\nRegional cooperation in the area of economic and social\ndevelopment will always be an indispensable prerequisite of\nany new order in the Middle-East region. In order for the\nnew dawn of peace which has just emerged with the\nsignature of the historic agreement between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel to continue,\ndevelop and become a reality, the international community\nhas assisted in rehabilitating the countries that suffered from\nthe war situation which, until recently, prevailed in the\nregion. In this context, while we pay special attention to\nsupporting the Palestinian people\u2019s progress to\nself-determination, we must also bear in mind the urgent\nneed of the Lebanese people for assistance and help them\nrebuild their economic and social infrastructures. Whatever\nassistance the international community can offer by way of\neconomic and administrative support will provide the\nfoundation for hope in a future of peace.\nThe Middle-East region is not the only part of the\nworld where optimism is diluted by fear. In many other\nparts of the world, the United Nations is deploying efforts\nthat aim at tipping the scales in favour of optimism against\nanxiety and fear.\nIn this context, while we value the United Nations\nefforts in Somalia, we believe that such efforts should be\nbased on concordance between the United Nations and the\ndifferent Somali factions. The success of the United Nations\noperations in Somalia depends on the cooperation that can\nbe achieved between the United Nations and the Somali\nfactions. The restoration of peace and stability cannot be\nachieved unless all Somali factions commit themselves to\ncooperate effectively with the United Nations in addressing\nthe problems and difficulties that face the Somali people.\nOn the European continent, the international community\ncontinues to witness another serious and highly sensitive\nproblem, namely the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. There is no doubt that it is the European\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncountries that bear the responsibility of addressing the\nhumanitarian, political, security and economic aspects of this\nproblem.\nThe principles of human rights, justice and equality\nhave always been the lofty ideals that civilized Europe\npreached and called upon the world to adhere to.\nParadoxically, the world has yet to see those lofty principles\nbeing put into practice and translated into measures that\nwould rescue the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina from\ntheir agony and from injustice and persecution. Although\nEurope is making efforts to steer the warring factions\ntowards reconciliation, the fact that Europe has failed to take\na decisive stand on the basis of justice and equality has\nmade the continuing tragedy of the people of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina doubly dangerous as its persistence may very\nwell encourage the forces of evil and oppression in other\nparts of the world to take heart and follow in the footsteps\nof the aggressors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a matter\nof fact, we are beginning to witness examples of such\nbehaviour, in the strife between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in\nthe continuing plight of Georgia, in the explosive situation\nin Tajikistan, and in the continuing civil war in Angola and\nin many other war-stricken areas, hotbeds of tension which\nmay explode at any moment and threaten world peace and\nsecurity.\nSome of those problems, as well as many others, are\nleft-overs from the cold war conflicts. They persist in\nvarious forms and put a heavy burden on the United Nations\nand its organs. As I said earlier, this international\nOrganization, with its present capabilities, cannot shoulder its\nresponsibilities as vigorously as it should if it is to achieve\nfull success in restoring stability whenever one of those\nproblems explodes. Therefore, we believe that the United\nNations should concentrate on issues of a humanitarian\nnature which attract a measure of regional and international\nconsensus that would support United Nations action. It must\nbe realized that if the United Nations goes on taking it upon\nitself to address the world\u2019s problems all in one go, it will\nsquander its capabilities and will risk failure. It is therefore\nmost important to establish a mechanism that would\ncoordinate the efforts of the United Nations and the regional\norganizations in addressing such problems and crises.\nWe, as members of this international Organization, are\nenthusiastic and eager to develop the current mechanisms of\nthe United Nations so that the Organization may be able to\ncontinue to play an essential and dynamic role in the world\nof tomorrow that should be built on the principles of\ndialogue and cooperation between countries and regional\neconomic groups. Economic development and scientific\nprogress will be principal features of that future world.\nHence the pressing need for re-examining the economic\nstructures of the various regimes that existed during the cold\nwar era. Such re-examination should be guided primarily by\nthe principles of free-market mechanisms and oriented\ntowards freeing the potential of third-world countries to\nacquire advanced technology in order for those countries to\nbe able to develop their resources and market their products\nwithout any economic barriers or restrictions. This, in our\nview, will help consolidate the world economic order and\ncontribute to the world economic recovery from the\nrecession that is currently wreaking havoc on the economies\nof the developed countries.\nCognizant of the growing interdependence and\nglobalization of the world economy, the Sultanate of Oman\ncontributes vigorously in this direction. For instance, in\ncooperation with large international institutions, the Sultanate\nof Oman has been involved in petrol resources development\nprojects in Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation with the\naim, inter alia, of assisting in the development and\nimprovement of the economies of these countries which we\nbelieve could ultimately lead to greater general security and\nstability.\nThe Sultanate of Oman believes that the increasingly\ninterdependent nature of the world economy is a major\ndevelopment in the post cold war era. We shall, therefore,\nwork with our neighbours and partners to promote mutual\neconomic prosperity. Our initiative towards building a\nstrategic pipeline to transfer natural gas to the peninsula of\nthe Indian subcontinent aims at fostering the economic\ngrowth of fraternal countries in that region. We call upon\nthe world to take collective action towards alleviating\npoverty and hunger, which are the two main sources of\nregional tensions and political upheavals.\nAllow me to take this opportunity to convey, on behalf\nof my Government, my sincere appreciation to the members\nof the Asian Group for their support and endorsement of the\ncandidature of the Sultanate of Oman for membership in the\nSecurity Council during the period of 1994-1995. By the\nsame token, my heartfelt gratitude goes to those countries\nand other groups which supported the candidature of my\ncountry. I should like to assure our supporters and all\nMember States that from the very beginning of its\nmembership, the Sultanate of Oman will do its utmost to\ncontribute to the achievement of the objectives of the United\nNations, particularly in the area of establishing and\nmaintaining peace.\nWith the desire for membership in the Security Council\ncomes a strong awareness of the special responsibilities\nentrusted to the members of the Council. We commit\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 7\nourselves to work collectively to achieve the effectiveness\nrequired for the implementation of the Security Council\u2019s\nresolutions and the success of the Secretary-General\u2019s\nefforts.\nThe Sultanate of Oman feels special responsibility\ntowards its youth and their future, as they are the future\ngeneration that will work to maintain the new world order.\nFor this reason, my country, based on its demographic\nprofile, has given priority to the promotion of youth\nprograms in its developmental, social and economic plans.\nWe look forward to cooperating with other States through\nthe United Nations in pursuing activities particularly aimed\nat the welfare of the youth of our communities.\nIn this context, I am delighted to highlight the\nSeptember 1993 report of the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund (UNICEF) which describes the achievements of\ncountries in the spheres of health and welfare of children.\nThe report states that the Sultanate of Oman ranked first\namong Middle Eastern and North African countries and\nsecond world wide in the reduction of the child mortality\nrate for under fives. Moreover, the Sultanate of Oman\noccupied the first place among Middle Eastern and North\nAfrican countries in the provision of vaccinations against\nmeasles. In the field of education, 91 per cent of our five-\nyear-old children are attending elementary school, a statistic\nwhich exceeds regional and international averages.\nWe shall continue to improve on these achievements\nthrough the fruitful cooperation between the Sultanate of\nOman and the organs of the United Nations, especially\nUNICEF, in the field of health programmes that would\nensure children\u2019s welfare and development to our\nsatisfaction. We view such efforts as good examples of how\ninternational cooperation can be seen to bring positive and\nbeneficial results to our communities. We shall endeavour\nto achieve even better results in this area.\nWhile we continue to focus on our youth, we also work\nsimultaneously and enthusiastically to conserve the\nenvironment in order to ensure a healthy and better place for\nthe next generation. In this regard, I should like to inform\nthe General Assembly that my country has recently become\npart of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the\nOzone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that\nDeplete the Ozone Layer. This is in line with our conviction\nthat the international agreements on the environment and our\ncommitment to such agreements are the right way to protect\nthis planet and its resources.\nThe environment, on which survival on this planet\ndepends, is still beset by pollution and the exhaustion of\nessential resources. Such a situation undermines the\nprosperity of the inhabitants of the planet. Without\noperational and effective economic plans for the\nimplementation of, and the relevant special procedures for,\nthe environment conservation programme, the prospects of\nsuccess for our efforts will be meagre indeed.\nAs in other areas, the differing levels of economic\ndevelopment from one country to the other lie behind\nenvironmental problems. We believe that the prevailing\nchronic recession in the world has not made it feasible to re-\nexamine and redefine our economic priorities. However,\nthere is a pressing and urgent need for such re-examination\nto be carried out against the backdrop of the environmental\nand economic challenges now facing us.\nThe recession that now plagues the industrialized\ncountries has resulted from the deterioration of growth rates\nin the Third World countries. We hope that the developed\ncountries will realize the importance of allowing the\ndeveloping countries to revitalize their economies so that the\neconomic order may regain the balance between the supply\nside upon which the economies of the industrialized\ncountries depend and the demand side which constitutes the\nbasis of the economic growth of the Third World countries.\nWe are concerned that if the developed countries are\nnot fully responsive to and supportive of the essential\nrequirements of economic recovery in the Third World\ncountries, the present world economic situation will\nultimately lead to a cancerous recession that will affect the\nwhole world and lead to disastrously negative consequences.\nFinally, it must be said that despite all this, we should\ntip the scales in favour of optimism regarding the prospects\nof building a new world of peace, brotherhood and\nprosperity. Regardless of the many hotbeds of regional and\nethnic conflicts, we are confident that our constructive\ndiscussions at this session and at all levels will ensure the\nemergence of a better world in the coming century that will\nbe free of all the tragic negative residues of the past. Our\nbest guarantee that it will be so is that our common future\nwill depend on positive cooperation between all countries in\nthe interests of international stability and prosperity under\nthe rule of law and in consonance with the behests of justice\nand sagacity.\n"

        "file_text": "The delegation of the\nDominican Republic takes great pleasure in extending its\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. Samuel Insanally on his\nwell-merited election to preside over the General Assembly\nat this forty-eighth session. A man from our America - and,\nmore specifically, from the Caribbean region, where both of\nour countries are located - he has the required abilities and\nexperience successfully to guide our work at this session,\nwhich must confront and deal with the major challenges\nfacing the international community, namely, the achievement\nof peace and the economic and social development of our\nnations.\nWe also wish to express our appreciation to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for the wisdom with\nwhich he led our deliberations at the previous session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to extend our\nthanks to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his commitment and for his\nefforts to carry out the principles and purposes of the\nOrganization\u2019s Charter.\nToday, in our America, we are witnessing the\nbeginnings of a negotiated solution to conflict, and we are\npleased that in Central America, and particularly in El\nSalvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, the disputes that have\ndisturbed the peace and hindered the development of our\npeoples are now being resolved at the negotiating table. In\nour Island of Hispaniola, imperial and colonial rivalry\ndivided the population into two peoples who, over the course\nof time, established two independent States - the Dominican\nRepublic, which we represent here, and the Republic of\nHaiti. The efforts being made by the Haitian people and\ntheir leaders, with international assistance in the form of\nnegotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and the\nOrganization of American States, are now beginning to bear\nfruit and will, we trust, restore normalcy to that fraternal\ncountry with the re-establishment of constitutional order.\nIn that connection our delegation reiterates its appeal to\nthe international community to lend real assistance to\nstabilize the democratic regime and to ensure the economic\nreconstruction of Haiti - assistance and cooperation adequate\nto meet the needs of peace and employment. The\nDominican Republic, in so far as it is able, remains ready to\ncontinue to cooperate with this fraternal people to lighten the\nheavy burden of its current problems.\nIn this respect, we are pleased to report that the Prime\nMinister of the Haitian Government, Mr. Robert Malval,\nrecently made an official visit to the Dominican Republic,\nwith a view to fully normalizing relations between the\nDominican and Haitian peoples and establishing the full\nspectrum of relations between the two countries, in their\nmutual interest. I am happy to say that the Haitian Prime\nMinister was given a very warm welcome by the President\nof the Dominican Republic, Mr. Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, who has\nalways been interested in finding a solution to our brother\ncountry\u2019s political conflict and especially in alleviating the\nserious economic situation there. As a result of the meeting,\nthe two statesmen reached an agreement, subsequently\nformalized, that will ensure the speedy and constructive\nnormalization of relations, with real reciprocal cooperation,\nbetween our two States.\nThere is no more appropriate forum than this for me,\non behalf of my country and Government, to appeal again\nfor massive aid from the most developed nations of the\nEarth to that afflicted and impoverished neighbouring brother\ncountry.\nSince the conquest and colonization of America, the\nDominican Republic has defended human rights. It was in\nour island, Hispaniola, that a loud voice was first raised on\nbehalf of the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of our\nAmerican lands - the voice of Brother Ant\u00f3n de Montesinos,\nin his famous Advent sermon. Faithful to that first call for\nthe redemption of our continent, our Government honours\nthis historical tradition, which is fully valid today in our\ncountry\u2019s official and private practice. It has been working\non instruments - which might eventually become\ninternational in nature - that will contribute to giving\njuridical force to that tradition.\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nOur country has advocated the universality of human\nrights. We believe that neither geographical, economic,\nsocial, religious nor cultural differences can ever be used as\na pretext for showing contempt for human rights.\nThe Dominican delegation believes that, because of the\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations - currently\nat 184 countries - there should be a more equitable\nrepresentation in the Security Council, while at the same\ntime we continue to abide by the provisions of paragraph 1\nof Article 23 of the United Nations Charter. Now that the\nbipolarity of the past has disappeared and the use and abuse\nof the veto are fading, the Council should become more\nrepresentative of the new international reality. This should\nbe done in broad consultations, after due reflection and with\naccount taken of the need for equity, so that the Council can\nbecome more representative without its effectiveness being\nin any way mitigated or weakened. Rather, its authority and\nresponsibility will be enhanced so that it can respond\neffectively to any crisis with which the international\ncommunity might be confronted, as the Council has done\nrecently. In this regard, we consider that it would be\npractical and feasible to give the Council greater flexibility\nin meeting the just aspirations of nations, such as the\nRepublic of China, that wish to become Members of the\nUnited Nations and cooperate in carrying out its principles.\nI would now like to express our views on developments\nin the international situation, particularly on conflicts that, in\none way or another, have been affecting international peace.\nI shall refer first to the Central American crisis, which,\nhappily, today is on the road to a definitive solution because\nof the positive evolution, under the auspices of the United\nNations, of the El Salvador peace agreements, and the recent\nreturn to democracy in Guatemala, which augurs well for the\ninstitutionalization of peace and prosperity in that region.\nNext, we would like to refer to one of the most\ncomplex and difficult conflicts facing the international\ncommunity today - that is, the existence of extreme\nnationalism, which in some cases has led to fratricidal wars\nand the annihilation of large groups of people because of\nracial and cultural hatred. This has happened in the former\nYugoslavia, where even now, despite the efforts of the\nUnited Nations and intensive diplomatic activity, blood is\nstill being shed between brother peoples that until recently\nlived together under one flag. Our Government wishes to\nsee a swift solution to the situation in the former Yugoslavia\nand reiterates its support for measures taken by the Security\nCouncil, in particular the establishment of an international\nwar tribunal to pass judgement on crimes against humanity\ncommitted in some areas of the conflict.\nWe would especially like to point to one positive\ndevelopment that represents perhaps our best hope for peace\ntoday: the transitional agreement between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of the\nState of Israel. The long-standing conflict in the Middle\nEast engendered dangerous tension that has kept the entire\nworld in suspense and has been regarded as the potential\nsource of a future conflagration of incalculable\ndestructiveness.\nIn connection with the development to which I have\njust referred - the agreement between the Palestinians and\nthe State of Israel - it might be time to defer consideration\nof or remove the items on that conflict that have long\nappeared on the General Assembly\u2019s agenda. With this\nreciprocal exchange of olive branches of peace, we can see\nthe promise of harmony between peoples that have been\nliving in such uneasy proximity.\nWe must recognize how the persistent diplomacy of the\nUnited States contributed to securing the results that have\nbeen achieved. The United States considered the situation\nwith a view to deciding what was possible in relations\nbetween the Arab and Jewish peoples. The agreement\nculminated in the signing at the White House in Washington.\nIn our opinion, that demonstrated unequivocally and very\nclearly to international public opinion the sincerity of the\nparties, who were fully aware of the extreme importance of\nthe commitments into which they were entering.\nWe must constantly stress the importance of the\nenvironment. After economic crisis and the imbalance\nbetween North and South, the major challenge facing\nmankind is the environmental crisis. The gradual destruction\nof ecosystems and the deteriorating quality of life of human\nbeings are unavoidable aspects of everyday existence for the\npeoples of the world. Thus, it is essential that the course of\nevents be changed. The political will of Governments and\nof all those who participate in organized civilian society will\nbe necessary to our taking up this great challenge, which\nwill involve commitment on the part of everyone - a\ncommitment from all mankind.\nIn that connection, the Dominican Republic supports the\ngeneral outline of the Plan of Action that was adopted at the\nsummit Conference on Environment and Development in Rio\nde Janeiro in 1992. Here we have a valuable instrument for\npolitical programming and regional cooperation to protect the\nenvironment in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe latter part of the twentieth century has witnessed\nmajor changes in world political affairs, ranging from the\nend of the cold war to democratization in the countries of\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 19\nEastern Europe.Despite this ideological thaw, however, we\nstill have arms trafficking and nuclear arsenals and,\ntherefore, a serious threat to peace.\nLet me refer once again to the situation in the Korean\npeninsula and mention specifically North Korea, which is\ncontinuing its nuclear research and investing enormous\nresources in this undertaking. Let us invite the Government\nof North Korea to become a party to the universal\nagreements on the control of nuclear weapons. Let us invite\nit to cooperate transparently and effectively with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in that body\u2019s\nimportant task of inspecting and monitoring nuclear\nfacilities. Willingness to do so would constitute evidence of\nthat Government\u2019s respect for its own nation and of its\nconcern for the future of its people and of all mankind.\nWe support United Nations measures to put an end to\narms trafficking. We support efforts to ensure transparency\nin military expenditures so that military activity may be\nmade more predictable, and peace and international security,\nat the regional and world levels, strengthened.\nLet me now turn to two important issues that are still\non the agenda of this Assembly.\nMay I, first, draw the attention of the international\ncommunity, as represented here, to the positive\ndevelopments in the area of drug trafficking, which are due\nto the success of many measures aimed at combating and\neradicating what has for too long been one of the most\nominous scourges of mankind. None the less, we must\nredouble our efforts to ensure that measures are implemented\nboth internally and internationally and result from\ncoordinated policies of all the nations represented here today.\nThe Dominican Republic has just become a party to the\n1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and the 1972\nProtocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic\nDrugs of 1961, bringing itself up to date on international\nlegislation in order the better to play its role in collaborating\nwith other States and agencies.\nThe other issue to which I wish to refer is the economic\ncrisis affecting most countries of the world. Today, the\nphenomenon of globalization of the economy and integration\nof regional blocs is typical of the international situation,\nwhich is evolving so rapidly that countries such as mine can\nno longer put off negotiations to determine their participation\nin multilateral free-trade agreements, customs unions or\nregional markets.\nIn this connection, the international activities of the\nDominican Republic focus on the economic programmes of\ncountries in our region and regional organizations that can\nhelp in our development and in our enjoyment of technical\nand financial cooperation.\nThe implementation of appropriate domestic policies by\nour Government will ensure that trade and investment will\nbecome the ideal means to strengthen bilateral relations,\nunderpinned, of course, by the unilateral granting of trade\nbenefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and by the\nopening up of our market under the Americas Initiative.\nIn the new international order, another of the major\nchallenges that the Dominican Republic must face is the\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its\npossible implications; we understand that NAFTA, as a\ntheoretical possible outcome, would imply an effort towards\nthe complete liberalization of trade throughout the\nhemisphere.\nI should like to emphasize the Dominican Republic\u2019s\nstrong support for holding a World Summit for Social\nDevelopment to take up matters relating to the social\nsituation in the world, particularly that of women, young\npeople, the elderly, the handicapped and families. The\nSummit will have to deliver a clear undertaking for common\npolicies to defend and protect these important segments of\nthe world\u2019s population collectively, and we hope that many\nof our countries will take measures to extend coverage and\nprotection for these social sectors, especially for children and\nthe elderly.\nWe should like to draw to members\u2019 attention a subject\nof serious concern to my Government and country, and that\nhas complex and serious ramifications that will be brought\nbefore the appropriate forums during the forty-eighth\nGeneral Assembly session. This is the Secretary-General\u2019s\nproposal to merge the International Research and Training\nInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) with\nthe United Nations Development Fund for Women\n(UNIFEM). Theoretically, the General Assembly will study\nthis proposal in November.\nMy Government attaches the greatest importance to this\ndecision, and requests this world forum to give it its closest\nattention in order to avoid committing a grave injustice by\ntaking hasty action or the like.\nINSTRAW was conceived at the First World\nConference on Women, held in Mexico City in 1975, and\nwas established as the result of a series of resolutions,\nincluding, we should like to recall, Economic and Social\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nCouncil resolution 1979/11 of 9 May 1979. This resolution\nspecified clearly that the permanent headquarters of the\nInstitute was to be my country, the Dominican Republic, a\ndeveloping country.\nMoreover, my Government gave the United Nations the\nbuilding that is being used as the Institute\u2019s headquarters.\nNot only that, it had to make significant investments in\nterms of money and other resources in order to overhaul the\nbuilding to bring it up to the specifications required by the\nOrganization.\nWe request the Secretary-General to postpone any\naction leading to merger between INSTRAW and UNIFEM\nuntil such time as the General Assembly considers his\nproposal and comes to its own conclusions on the matter.\nAlso, it would seem that there is an attempt being made\nto ignore, unilaterally, the Agreement between the United\nNations and the host Government that is the legal framework\nwithin which INSTRAW operates. My Government regards\nthis as a serious - an extremely serious - impropriety, and\nreserves the right to use all relevant legal means to assert its\nlegitimate rights.\nFinally, the delegation I lead calls upon the consciences\nof all nations and on all those leaders who bear upon their\nshoulders responsibility for the destiny of their countries and\nthe world, for peace, common sense and mutual respect to\nprevail over violence and for there to be cooperation and\nsolidarity between peoples; for these are the supreme\npurposes of this Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure to\ncongratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his election\nto the high office of the presidency of the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nI am also delighted to welcome the new Members of\nthe Organization. In this regard allow me to welcome\nespecially the State of Eritrea as a Member of the United\nNations. At the end of a cruel war the people of Eritrea\nexercised their right to self-determination and opted for\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 33\nsovereign statehood in a referendum which won praise from\nthe United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and\nother international organizations as being free and fair.\nAddis Ababa and Asmara took steps immediately to forge a\nnew era of close relationship and cooperation.\nThe healing of the wounds of war has progressed\ndramatically. Building for shared prosperity is progressing\nin earnest. Ethiopia believes that the spirit in which the\nEritrean problem was resolved, as well as the developments\ntaking place to forge a basis for permanent peace and all-\nround cooperation, is a unique manifestation of the era of\nchange from conflict to concord. Peace has provided us\nwith the opportunity to concentrate on reconstruction and lay\nthe groundwork for sustainable development in Ethiopia and\nin Eritrea.\nThe vision of the Ethiopian and Eritrean leaderships\nand peoples is for economic, social and cultural integration\nleading to political integration on a new plane. The\nleaderships of the two countries have a vision for expanding\nsuch integration to include the countries of the subregion.\nThe establishment of peace and stability is therefore a\npriority agenda in the coordinated efforts of our two\nGovernments and we are determined to pursue our\nobjectives, however difficult the hurdles may be.\nNevertheless, we recognize that the Ethiopian and Eritrean\nsituation does not cover all the hopes and expectations for\nthe changes that have taken place in the last few years.\nAs there are encouraging developments in some parts\nof the world, we are also witnessing painful situations in\nothers. The crisis in Somalia is a case in point. Since this\ncrisis is at the heart of my Government\u2019s concerns, I would\nlike to beg the indulgence of this Assembly to take a few\nmoments to make a brief comment on the disturbing\ndevelopments there.\nIt is to be recalled that the Security Council\u2019s decision\nto restore order and to open the channels for the delivery of\nhumanitarian aid was put into effect in December 1992 and\nthereafter. Immediate action was then taken to bring\ntogether the warring factions as well as representatives of\nvarious sectors of Somali society. The aim was to secure\ntheir agreement on a plan of action for the restoration of\npeace and the establishment of the structures of civil\nadministration. In particular, the reconciliation input of the\nhigh-level Horn of Africa Standing Committee on Somalia\nwas brought to bear at the Conference held in Addis Ababa\nin March of this year. An agreement was hammered out on\na series of measures leading to peace and political stability\nin the country. The main elements of the agreement\nincluded a cease-fire; a programme of disarmament; regional\nreconciliation; measures on finding a political solution to be\nachieved through the establishment of elected district and\nregional councils, to culminate in the establishment of a\ntransitional national council as the highest organ of state; and\nthe principles for the settlement of conflicts relating to\nproperty claims.\nConcurrently, the Addis Ababa agreement of March\n1993 provides for modalities of continuing humanitarian\nrelief and the initiation of rehabilitation as well as\nreconstruction programmes. The United Nations Operation\nin Somalia (UNOSOM) was to manage peace-keeping and\nthe maintenance of an appropriate environment for the\nexecution of rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes.\nIt was then hoped that implementation of the political\naspects of the Addis Ababa agreement would proceed as\nplanned.\nHowever, the Somali situation took a tragic turn,\nparticularly when, on 5 June this year, United Nations\npeace-keepers from Pakistan and many Somalis were killed.\nThat was a deplorable incident indeed, and we continue to\nbe seriously disturbed by the tragic events which have\nresulted since then in further loss of life with no apparent\nend to the crisis. Indeed, there is a deadlock and a dilemma\nas to how to overcome the impasse in Mogadishu.\nIn the view of my delegation, a thorough review of all\naspects of the Somali situation by the United Nations is\nimperative. Such a review should be aimed at restoring the\nsituation that existed before 5 June and at proceeding from\nthere with the implementation of the Addis Ababa\nagreement. In this respect, it is clear that involving the\nfactions as well as representatives of the various sectors of\nSomali society in the processes is vital.\nUNOSOM is the last chance Somalia has. Therefore,\nit must not be allowed to fail. Its preoccupation with the 5\nJune incident should not be allowed to divert its attention\nfrom its ultimate goal of political reconciliation and\neconomic and social rehabilitation. It must be recognized\nthat, for the objectives of UNOSOM to be achieved, the\nbattle for the hearts and minds of all Somalis must be won.\nMy delegation believes that all UNOSOM troops should be\nmaterially and spiritually equipped to fight and win such a\nwar, and that whenever there are shortcomings in that regard\nUNOSOM should be prepared to act promptly to redress\nthem. Ethiopia is ready to contribute its share to such a\nscenario. It will be recalled, in this regard, that the\nOrganization of African Unity at its summit meeting in\nCairo in June of this year gave a mandate to President Meles\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nZenawi of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia to follow\nup and assist in the resolution of the Somali crisis. This\nmandate was endorsed by the fourth summit of the Heads of\nState and Government of the Inter-Governmental Authority\non Drought and Development (IGADD).\nI would like to quote from the Declaration adopted by\nthe fourth summit of IGADD, held in Addis Ababa on 6 and\n7 September 1993.\n\\\"We applaud the positive achievements of the\nUnited Nations in Somalia in preventing the death of\nthousands of Somalis through starvation and conflict;\n\\\"We reinforce the conviction that caution is\nrequired in handling the current very complicated\npolitical situation in Somalia;\n\\\"We further call for a meaningful consultation\nbetween UNOSOM and the countries of the subregion\nand reiterate the need for a more active role on the part\nof the countries of the subregion;\n\\\"We fully endorse the mandate given to President\nMeles Zenawi to follow developments in Somalia on\nbehalf of the OAU by also mandating him to follow up\nthe developments in that member State on behalf of the\ncountries of the subregion.\\\"\nWhile the implementation of the Addis Ababa\nagreement is, in our considered view, the only viable avenue\ntowards a political solution to the Somali crisis, we also\nregard UNOSOM as a guarantor against a slide into anarchy\nin Somalia. We urge UNOSOM to continue with its task\nuntil the objectives of the Addis Ababa agreement are fully\nachieved.\nThe problem of refugees and persons displaced by a\nhost of calamities continues to haunt the Horn of Africa\nsubregion. In this regard, Ethiopia continues to face\nimmense difficulties, the solutions of which are beyond what\nits meagre resources and capacities allow. On top of this,\nEthiopia has to cope with the requirements of settling close\nto 1 million returnees.\nIt is to be recalled that agreement on principles for the\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance was reached with the\ndonors at the Horn of Africa Conference held in Addis\nAbaba in April 1992. Those principles should be observed\nto ensure that relief assistance reaches the needy.\nHuman life is precious. Denying people the right to\nsurvival, therefore, is a crime. Those who hamper the\ndelivery of relief aid to the needy are criminals. Likewise,\nthose who hold human survival hostage to their political\nagendas cannot and must not be regarded as anything but\ncriminals.\nIt may be possible to put pressure on the recipients with\na view to adjusting their positions in ways that would\nfacilitate the delivery of relief aid. But the thought of\napplying pressure on the donors is, to say the least,\nnightmarish. I would like to stress that humanitarian work\nshould be absolutely depoliticized.\nWith respect to other issues of concern to the\ninternational community, I would like to refer to the\npromising developments in South Africa. My delegation\nwelcomes the decision on the establishment of a Transitional\nExecutive Council responsible for supervising the process of\ntransition towards a non-racial, democratic South Africa.\nWe commend and support all the political leaders for their\nbold actions in paving the way for a peaceful transition to\ndemocracy in South Africa.\nRegrettably, however, there are areas of grave concern\nwhere peace has yet to materialize. In this regard, the\nresumption of hostilities in Angola is a blow to the\nstupendous efforts made by the international community and\nby Angolans themselves to restore peace in that country.\nWe appeal to the parties concerned to resolve their\ndifferences at the negotiating table, taking into account the\nelections, which have been declared free and fair by\ninternational observers, as a reference for a political\nsettlement of the Angolan conflict.\nOn other areas of conflict in Africa, Ethiopia appeals to\nits brothers in Rwanda, Mozambique and Liberia to continue\nthe momentum towards the establishment of peace in their\nrespective countries. Likewise, it is Ethiopia\u2019s fervent hope\nthat our brothers in the Sudan will soon discover the happy\nmedium that brings peace and tranquility.\nOn the Middle East, Ethiopia welcomes the first step\ntowards a settlement embodied in the historic agreement\nsigned in Washington by Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO). We warmly congratulate the leaders of\nboth sides on their courageous move, and hope that the\nmomentum towards a comprehensive settlement of the\nMiddle East conflict will pick up speed as a result.\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 35\nHowever, it appears that our hopes in some areas of the\nworld are destined to be tempered by virtual despair in\nothers. I am referring here to the tragic situation in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina and the senseless killing that seems to have\nno end. I call it senseless not with the intent of passing\njudgement on the legitimacy of the respective positions of\nthe parties to the conflict, but rather to underline the\nuniversal belief that the dividends of peace are so much\ngreater than the gains of an enormously destructive war. In\nfull recognition of the fact that an end to the war in Bosnia\nand Herzegovina is in the hands of the combatants\nthemselves, we appeal to them to cooperate with\ninternational mediation efforts.\nHumanity wants peace. Thus, humanity is looking to\nthe United Nations and hopes that this Organization\u2019s\nresources and fortitude will make the desired impact through\npreventive diplomacy, conflict management and conflict\nresolution. At the regional level, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, at its twenty-ninth summit, held in Cairo last\nJune, decided to establish a mechanism for the prevention,\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts. Ethiopia is\ncommitted to work vigorously for its effective\nimplementation and for its success.\nAlthough we are far from being satisfied, the newly\nemerging international situation indicates some encouraging\nprospects in the area of political relationships. In the field\nof international economic relations, however, the situation is\nfar from encouraging. Our world still faces the\nuncomfortable reality of its division into two blocs: the\naffluent and the poor, the North and the South. Poverty still\nrepresents the greatest threat to democratic governance and\nworld peace and security. Political instability, corruption,\nhunger, illicit drug trafficking and a litany of other evils\ntrace their roots to mass poverty. And the international\ncommunity is not unaware of the factors that have conspired\nto frustrate the hopes and aspirations of poor countries.\nPromises of special programmes for the least developed\ncountries, 10-year action programmes and so forth agreed\nupon by the international community have so far made little\ndifference by way of alleviating poverty. In Africa, overall\neconomic growth continues to lag behind population growth.\nAnd the continent remains the poorest of all. Since there\ncan be no stability or better prospects for the world without\nreducing the disparities in levels of global development, both\ndeveloped and developing countries should conduct a\nconstructive dialogue on practical measures for stimulating\ndevelopment.\nEnvironment and development are the two major\nconcerns to which the international community has turned its\nattention. In particular, Ethiopia appreciates the international\ncommunity\u2019s support for the effort to combat desertification\nand drought, which are causing extensive environmental\ndegradation in Africa. We appeal to all Member States to\nsupport fully the efforts of the intergovernmental negotiating\ncommittee for the elaboration of an international convention\nto combat desertification. Environmental degradation is a\nmajor development bottleneck which must be addressed as\na matter of urgency.\nThis occasion provides me an opportunity to share with\nthis Assembly a few thoughts on the situation prevailing in\nEthiopia since the establishment of the transitional\nGovernment two years ago. The process of democratization\nand self-rule has been consolidated through local and\nregional elections. The policy on equitable power-sharing\namong the various regions and nationalities has succeeded in\nensuring peace and stability throughout the country. These,\ncoupled with the implementation of liberalized economic\nreforms, reconstruction programmes and improved weather\nconditions, have brought about encouraging improvements in\nthe economy. The supportive role of international financial\ninstitutions and the donor community have had a useful\nimpact on the positive outcome of Ethiopia\u2019s reconstruction\nand recovery efforts. Therefore, in a brief period of two\nyears, Ethiopia has emerged from a state of despair to one\nof recovery. We are now looking to the future with\nconsiderable confidence.\nWith respect to political programmes, Ethiopia has\nlaunched the final phase of the transition period with work\non drafting a constitution. When the constitution is\napproved, multi-party elections are planned, on the basis of\nwhich permanent State structures will be put in place.\nAlready, an independent judiciary is functioning, and\nlegality is assuming a prominent role in guaranteeing the\nhuman rights of the people. Peaceful political activity, a\nfree press and freedom of expression and of conscience are\nestablished features of Ethiopian life today. Our democratic\nattitude is working. It is working in consolidating peace and\nstability and in generating investor and business confidence.\nIt has worked in restoring the confidence of the people in\ntheir own future.\nEthiopia is committed to the observance of all aspects\nof the protection of human rights. Protection of the dignity\nof man also means freedom from poverty. \\\"Prisoner of\nconscience\\\" and \\\"prisoner of poverty\\\" are one and the same.\nThe right to freedom of expression and the right to education\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nare indivisible. Concern for human rights is virtually\nmeaningless without corresponding action on the alleviation\nof poverty, ignorance and other causes of deprivation.\nEthiopia therefore appeals to the international community to\ncooperate in addressing the issue of human rights in the\ncontext of these general principles.\nOur democratic outlook with respect to our relations\nwith neighbouring countries and peoples has borne fruit.\nEthiopia has never enjoyed such harmony, both internally\nand in its relations with its neighbours.\nEthiopia has attained the requisite self-confidence that\nmakes it a true partner in the community of nations. I wish\ntherefore to reiterate the continued faith of my country in the\ncollective wisdom of our global Organization and to pledge\nanew our unreserved support for the laudable efforts of the\nUnited Nations system. We believe that as the guarantor of\ninternational peace and stability, the United Nations should\nexpand its efforts by stepping up its activities in the field of\npreventive diplomacy. It should develop new, more\neffective machinery to coordinate actions aimed at enhancing\nrespect for the norms of international law and ensuring the\nsecurity and interests of all States.\nAlongside the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, we welcome United Nations efforts in assisting the\ndeveloping countries in their endeavour to achieve a greater\ndegree of economic development and self-reliance. The role\nof the United Nations in world affairs is all-inclusive. For\nthis role to be effective, it is important that the\nOrganization\u2019s methods of operation be characterized by\naccountability and transparency. Ethiopia subscribes to the\ncalls for democratizing the decision-making processes of the\nUnited Nations system and for streamlining its bureaucracy.\nI am hopeful that at this session the General Assembly will\nreview and assess these priority issues with a view to\nrevitalizing the Organization so that it can meet the\nimperatives of the time.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of my delegation,\nmay I condole through the delegation of India, with the\nGovernment and people of India over the natural calamity\nwhich has befallen that great people. Allow me, at the\noutset, to congratulate you sincerely on your election to the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. I should also like to express my\ncountry\u2019s appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan\nGanev, for his constructive efforts. We hope that in\ncontinuing to play a constructive role in the new\ninternational environment the General Assembly will benefit\nfrom your diplomatic skills and broad experience.\nMay I also take this opportunity to express our\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his dedication to the United Nations and\nfor his efforts aimed at reforming the Organization at this\ncritical juncture.\nI should like also to welcome the new countries that\nhave joined the United Nations. We are confident that their\nmembership will enhance the role of the Organization and\nfurther universal acceptance of its principles and purposes,\nwhich aim at establishing and strengthening international\npeace and security and ensuring that justice is done.\nToday, the people of the Jamahiriya celebrate the\nanniversary of the departure of the last remnants of Fascism\nfrom Libyan soil, thus putting an end to a period in its\nhistory that was characterized by the domination of settler-\ncolonialism, a period during which injustice and persecution\nprevailed. As our people celebrate this anniversary today,\nthey reaffirm that relations between Libya and the State from\nwhich those settlers came are now relations of good-\nneighbourliness, based on understanding and cooperation in\nevery field.\nDuring the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, there were numerous developments in the\ninternational situation. However, before I speak of my\ncountry\u2019s position on those developments, allow me to start\nwith a question which is of great importance to us and\nwhich is not unrelated to those recent international\ndevelopments. Rather, it is one of their by-products. It has\nto do with the tendency of certain countries to impose\nsolutions to their differences with other countries in a\nmanner that is not consonant with the Charter of the United\nNations or with international norms and conventions. In so\ndoing, those countries tend to deliberately apply double\nstandards, especially when the dispute is with a country that\npursues independent policies and adopts unsubmissive\npositions. This is the case with regard to the dispute that\narose between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and France,\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 5\nBritain and the United States of America, when the three\ncountries declared that they suspected the involvement of\nLibyan nationals in the Pan American and UTA plane\nincidents and demanded that two Libyan citizens be handed\nover to stand trial in Scotland or the United States of\nAmerica. Notwithstanding the fact that the Libyan\nauthorities, once notified, took the appropriate legal steps,\nthe other parties refused to cooperate with the Libyan\nauthorities or to await the results of their ongoing\ninvestigations. Instead, they resorted to the Security Council\nand directed it to deal with this matter under Chapter VII of\nthe Charter, which has nothing to do with the issue in\nquestion. Libya has not threatened anyone, nor has it\nendangered international peace and security. The whole\nthing is a question of suspicions and allegations that have to\nbe investigated through judicial channels.\nAlthough my country realizes that this matter has been\naddressed, intentionally, within a framework that is totally\nincompatible with its legal character, it has continued to\ninvestigate the whole issue, as it has done since it was\nnotified of the matter, because it is determined to uncover\nthe circumstances and facts surrounding the case. Libya has\nalso declared its readiness to cooperate by responding to the\nrequirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992),\nwhich include cooperation with the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations to ensure the success of the mission\nentrusted to him by that resolution.\nIn this respect, my country has reiterated its\ncondemnation of international terrorism in every shape and\nform. It has severed relations with all organizations and\nentities suspected of being involved in terrorist acts and has\naffirmed that it will not allow its territory, institutions or\ncitizens to be used, directly or indirectly, for the carrying out\nof such acts. It has declared its readiness to punish severely\nthose proven guilty of involvement in terrorist activities. My\ncountry has also declared that there are no terrorist training\ncamps on its soil and has invited the Security Council, or\nany other international body the Council may choose, to\ninvestigate and verify this.\nIn addition, my country has cooperated with the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom in trying to find\nindividuals whom the British Government has accused of\ninvolvement in terrorist acts. More than one meeting has\nbeen held in this respect, and British officials have\nconfirmed the Jamahiriya\u2019s positive cooperation with them\nin this matter. Moreover, in order to determine the\nresponsibility for the bombing of the French UTA plane,\nmore than one meeting has been held between the Libyan\ninvestigative judge and his French counterpart. Contacts are\nongoing with the French authorities to arrange the French\njudge\u2019s visit, and his mission will be facilitated, provided he\narrives in a peaceful and civilized manner and not in the\nmanner of sixteenth-century gunboat diplomacy.\nI have spoken briefly of the measures taken by Libya\nin response to the stipulations of Security Council\nresolution 731 (1992). As regards the determination of\nresponsibility for these terrorist acts to which the American\nand French planes were subjected, my country took legal and\ninvestigative measures and has called on the British and\nAmerican authorities to cooperate in completing the\ninvestigation. It has also called on neutral bodies and\ninternational and humanitarian organizations to verify the\nfairness of the investigations.\nConcerning its contribution to the eradication of\ninternational terrorism, the aforementioned practical\nmeasures prove my country\u2019s seriousness in stamping out\nthis phenomenon. Libya\u2019s eagerness to eliminate\ninternational terrorism was embodied in our call for the\nconvening of a special session of the General Assembly to\nstudy the causes and dimensions of the problem.\nThe matter that has not yet been resolved is that\nrelating to the request by the British and American\nauthorities to turn over the two suspects to stand trial in the\ncourts of one of those countries. My country has spared no\neffort in seeking to resolve this problem in accordance with\nthe conventions of legality. We offered to go to the\nInternational Court of Justice and we proposed surrendering\nthe two suspects to the United Nations office in Libya for\ninvestigation. We also proposed that the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations establish a legal fact-finding\ncommittee to examine the verisimilitude of the accusations\nand carry out a comprehensive investigation.\nThe competent authorities in my country put this\nproblem before the Basic People\u2019s Congresses - the\nlegislative authority - in Libya, which adopted a decision\nwherein they stated they would not object to the suspects\nbeing tried before an unbiased and fair court agreed upon by\nall concerned. On this basis, my country announced its\nreadiness to enter into negotiations with the countries\nconcerned, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, on\na venue for the trial that could be agreed upon by all parties\nto the dispute and that would guarantee an environment\nconducive to revealing the truth. To our minds, this is the\nsubstance of Security Council resolution 731 (1992). The\nSecretary-General was notified of this step in December\n1992 and again last July, when he was informed that Libya\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwas prepared to discuss the proceedings and arrangements\nrelating to the trial.\nThe position taken by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nconcerning these disputes met with widespread approval\nfrom various States and regional organizations, including the\nNon-Aligned Movement, which is made up of some 110\nStates (see the Jakarta Message, A/47/675); the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, with its 54 members\n(resolutions 6/20 and 21/14); the League of Arab States,\nwhich has 22 members (resolutions 5156, 5158, 5161, 5224\nand 5281); and, last but not least, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), which consists of more than 50\nStates. The OAU, in resolution 1457, expressed appreciation\nfor Libya\u2019s initiatives towards the resolution of this dispute\nand commended Libya\u2019s readiness to cooperate with the\nlegal and judicial authorities and called upon the Security\nCouncil to review resolution 748 (1992) with a view to\nlifting the embargo imposed on Libya.\nThe positions taken by these organizations show that\nthey see the justice of the Libyan viewpoint, and also\nhighlight their interest in playing their roles in resolving the\ndispute by peaceful means according to Chapter VIII of the\nCharter. It was hoped that the three States concerned would\ntake these positions into consideration and respond to the\nLibyan initiatives, but our efforts have been rejected.\nMoreover, the States concerned have discredited both the\nflexibility and responsiveness of the Libyan position and\nhave insisted, in contravention of international laws and\npractices, on the extradition of the suspects to the United\nStates or Britain to stand trial before the courts of one of\nthose countries.\nLibya has not, in principle, rejected the trial of the\nsuspects, as it has confirmed from the very start. All Libya\nhas asked for, and is still determined to obtain, is a\nlegitimate and unbiased trial with all the legal and\npsychological guarantees that go with it. Intensive\nconsultations and contacts in this regard were recently\nconducted, and their results were communicated to the\nSecretary-General on 24 September 1993. Libya considers\nthe content of the Secretary-General\u2019s reply sufficient and\nacceptable, and, therefore, the only step left in the resolution\nof this problem is that of convincing the suspects to submit\nthemselves to the Scottish judiciary. The Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya is encouraging them to do so. This was\ncommunicated to the Secretary-General in two letters\ncontained in document S/26523, dated 1 October 1993.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has responded\npragmatically to the stipulations of Security Council\nresolution 731 (1992). Now it becomes necessary not only\nto abandon the efforts aimed at tightening the sanctions\nimposed by resolution 748 (1992), but to lift those sanctions\nimmediately. This is why we appeal to this Assembly,\nwhich represents the conscience of the world, to support the\nmeasures that have been called for by the international and\nregional organizations I have mentioned.\nThe sanctions have caused the Libyan people much\nmisery and have cost them billions of dollars in material\nlosses, to which must be added the deaths of hundreds of\nchildren, women and elderly people. I do not want to go\ninto detail, for we have elaborated on this in 14 documents,\nthe latest of which is document S/26139. However, in brief,\nlet me say that the embargo has prevented about 8,525\npatients with severe illnesses from travelling abroad for\ntreatment. It has prevented college professors from\ntravelling to Libya and has led to the suspension of contracts\nwith hundreds of physicians. The embargo has caused the\nnumber of fatal road accidents to double because of the\ndifficulty in transporting the injured to specialized hospitals\nin neighbouring countries. Also, the death rate among cattle\nhas been high because of lack of immunization and a\nshortage of preventive medications. It has cut the revenue\nfrom economic activities by more than $2,400,000,000.\nFurthermore, there is a severe lack of spare parts for aircraft,\nwhich has led to a plane crash with 157 fatalities among\npassengers of various nationalities.\nThe easing of tensions in international relations has\nenabled the international community to achieve progress in\nthe areas of disarmament and the protection of human rights.\nIt has also enhanced international efforts aimed at solving\ndisputes which, until recently, have been a source of great\nconcern. This has included the reconciliation in Cambodia\nand the maintenance of stability in Central America. There\nare also positive signs regarding the attainment of lasting\npeace in Mozambique. Important steps have been taken\ntowards full national reconciliation in Liberia, and the\ndispute in Rwanda is on its way to a final solution.\nHowever, these hopeful developments should not mask the\nfact that the world now is in the grip of unprecedented\ntensions and conflicts, which necessitate further efforts by\nthe United Nations and regional organizations not only to\nresolve them but also to prevent certain countries from\nmonopolizing the resolution of such conflicts. The problem\nof Cyprus remains unsolved. The situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the Balkans in general has deteriorated and\ncontinues to cause much human misery. Afghanistan has not\nachieved total stability yet, and fighting in Angola has\nintensified. The national peace accords there have not been\ngenuinely observed, regardless of the international and\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 7\nregional efforts deployed. The situation in South Africa has\nwitnessed some positive developments, but an immediate\nstop must be put to the acts of violence which negatively\naffect the transformation of South Africa into a unified,\ndemocratic and non-racial State.\nFor more than four decades, the United Nations has\ncontinued to adopt numerous resolutions on the question of\nPalestine. Regardless, the Israelis have refused to comply\nwith any of those resolutions, all of which recognize the\ninalienable and legitimate right of the Palestinian people to\nself-determination and their right to return to their homeland.\nThe provisions of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) on\nthe right of return for refugees, of resolution 478 (1980) on\nJerusalem, of resolution 3375 (XXX) on the right to self-\ndetermination and of resolution 799 (1992) on deportees are\nonly a few dead letter examples. Despite the recent\ndevelopments concerning the question of Palestine, the\nposition of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya regarding this issue\nand the conflict in the Middle East remains as we have\npreviously explained it, and let me now reiterate it: all\noccupied Arab territories should be liberated, and the\nPalestinian people should be supported until they have\nregained all their rights - the foremost of which being their\nright to self-determination, their right to return to their land\nand their right to establish in Palestine their own State,\nwhere both Arabs and Jews can live on an equal footing.\nIn another part of the Arab homeland, namely Somalia,\nthe situation is still a source of grave concern. Although\nearlier efforts were successful in creating a safe environment\nfor the distribution of humanitarian relief assistance to those\nsuffering from the widespread famine, the recent events,\nwhich indicate that the circumstances have changed, show\nhow sensitive the situation is in that region. My country,\nwhich has closely followed the developments in Somalia,\nremains convinced that solutions to problems cannot be\nimposed by force regardless of the enforcer. Solutions can\nbe found only through dialogue and understanding.\nFirst and foremost, the Somalis themselves should\nabandon their differences and work together to implement\nthe agreements they have reached so that Somalia and its\npeople may regain peace, security and stability.\nGiven our conviction that peace and security in the\nMediterranean region is closely related, not only to security\nand cooperation with Africa and Europe, but also to world\npeace and security, the strengthening of security and\ncooperation in the region is a high priority for the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya. That is the reason why my country\nwelcomed General Assembly resolutions in this regard as\nwell as the resolutions adopted on the subject by other\norganizations, such as the Non-Aligned Movement. Once\nagain, we declare that we welcome any and all initiatives\naimed at removing the causes of tension, enhancing stability\nand expanding cooperation in the region.\nMy country is fully cognizant of the fact that the\nstrengthening of security and cooperation in the\nMediterranean region is a multidimensional issue. However,\nwe continue to believe that withdrawal of foreign fleets and\nthe closing down of foreign bases in this region constitute\nthe essential elements. Such a step would enhance\nconfidence-building in the area and channel resources\ntowards economic and social development. At the same\ntime, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya believes that the use of\ndialogue and understanding - on the basis of mutual respect\nfor sovereignty and in accordance with international norms\nand conventions - to settle differences would also constitute\na basic element in restoring security and stability to the\nMediterranean region. Moreover, intensified collaboration\nand coordination of efforts in areas of common interest\nwould further enhance cooperation. For this reason, the\nJamahiriya welcomes the steps taken within regional\ngroupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Western\nMediterranean Grouping (5 + 5), as such steps constitute an\nimportant breakthrough towards the realization of peoples\u2019\naspirations after peace, security and cooperation.\nConcrete progress has been made over the past few\nyears in the area of disarmament, especially with regard to\nthe reduction of nuclear-weapon stockpiles and accession by\nmore countries to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. While it\nwelcomes those developments, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\ndoes not consider them to be sufficient and believes that the\ndanger of nuclear proliferation requires further international\nefforts that would lead to the complete elimination of all\nweapons of mass destruction in the case of every State that\npossesses, produces or stockpiles them. Consequently, my\ncountry supports all initiatives aimed at achieving this end,\nincluding the enhancement of the United Nations\ndisarmament mechanisms and especially the Conference on\nDisarmament, whose work has been crowned by the\nChemical Weapons Convention. This is an ambitious\ndocument on the road to general and complete disarmament.\nHowever, my country has so far abstained from signing this\nConvention because of the existence in the region we live in\nof weapons of mass destruction that are not subject to\ninternational safeguards and inspection. Under such\ncircumstances, it is difficult to consider the Chemical\nWeapons Convention without considering other weapons of\nmass destruction in the Middle East, mainly nuclear\nweapons.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMy country has supported the call for the establishment\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones, including the proposal by the\nArab Republic of Egypt which calls for making the Middle\nEast an area free of weapons of mass destruction. Based on\nmy country\u2019s eagerness to stamp out the dangers of such\nweapons and in order to get rid of them, it has called on the\nUnited Nations to adopt the necessary measures to destroy\nnuclear, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass\ndestruction, such as ballistic missiles, and to prohibit and\ncriminalize the development, possession and use of all such\nweapons.\nThe international family\u2019s current efforts to establish\nsecurity and stability in the world, mainly through the\nredoubling of efforts to contain political crises and end\nregional disputes, should be expanded to embrace economic\nproblems as well. The impact of economic problems on\ninternational peace and security is not less dangerous than\nthat of armed conflicts. According to the 1993 World\nEconomic Survey, the world economy continues to stagnate.\nIts revitalization requires urgent international measures\nwhich would give special attention to the developing\ncountries, which suffer from economic difficulties that arise\nfrom trade protectionism, large external debts, restrictions on\nthe transfer of technology, the reverse flow of resources and\nlow commodity prices.\nIn the context of the international community\u2019s efforts\nto promote economic and social development, my country\nwishes to draw attention to the danger of the coercive\nmeasures of various forms, to which some developing\ncountries, including mine, are being subjected. Such\nmeasures constitute one of the main obstacles to\ndevelopment and run counter to the Charter, the rules of\ninternational law and to all relevant General Assembly\nresolutions.\nSupport for development efforts also requires the\ninternational community to honour its commitments to\ncertain development programmes, such as the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\nAfrica attaches great hope to this programme because it\nwould help promote developmental efforts that began with\nthe establishment of Africa\u2019s economic community and have\nbeen enhanced by the establishment of a number of\nsubregional groupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union,\nwhich has taken important steps towards improving the use\nof the region\u2019s resources and towards strengthening the\nregional ties that would enhance the adoption of common\npolicies by its member countries in the political, economic\nand social spheres.\nLast year\u2019s Earth Summit yielded important results.\nWe are satisfied with the measures adopted towards the\nrealization of the Conference\u2019s objectives, especially the\nbeginnings of a convention to combat drought and\ndesertification. This is an extremely important issue for my\ncountry and for the whole North Africa region, which suffers\nfrom a shortage of water and is threatened by drought and\ncreeping desertification. Furthermore, we believe that true\ndetermination to protect the environment lies in international\ncooperation and in honouring the commitments made at the\nRio Conference. Protection of the environment is one of my\ncountry\u2019s top priorities. Our first step in combating drought\nand desertification is the great man-made river. Our national\nplans include the reclamation of thousands of hectares of\ndesert for the purpose of agriculture and settlement.\nIn this respect, I must inform the Assembly that our\nefforts to expand environmental protection and maintenance\nare being hampered by the widespread presence of remnants\nof war, and of mines that were laid in Libya\u2019s soil during\nWorld War II. International and regional organizations have\nadopted numerous resolutions in this connection, and the\nGeneral Assembly has also adopted similar resolutions, the\nlatest of which was resolution 40/197. All those resolutions\nhave called upon the countries responsible to provide the\ninformation and technical assistance required for the removal\nof those mines and other remnants of war, and to pay\ncompensation for the damage caused. Today, we call once\nagain upon those countries to shoulder their responsibility\nand to respond to the calls of the international community\nand the United Nations resolutions on the remnants and\ndebris of war.\nThe adoption of international policies and programmes\naimed at ensuring mankind\u2019s well-being and attaining the\nbest possible standard of living is one of our objectives. On\nthis basis, my country welcomes the convening of the\nInternational Conference on Population and Development\nnext year, and of the World Conference on Women and the\nWorld Summit for Social Development in 1995. To our\nmind, these conferences will give a strong political impetus\nto international efforts and activities aimed at stamping out\nunderdevelopment, poverty and hunger. In welcoming these\nconferences, we are encouraged by the important results\nfrom the International Conference on Human Rights. They\nare a great achievement in the promotion of respect for\nhuman rights and basic freedoms.\nMy country which belongs to one of the great cultures\nof the world, namely the Arab-Islamic culture that has\ncontributed greatly to the promotion of human rights, is\ndetermined to continue to support the international\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 9\ncommunity\u2019s efforts, deployed through the United Nations\nand its organs, in the area of human rights, so that we may\nrealize the goals of the Vienna Declaration and Programme\nof Action.\nGiven its interest in human rights which it considers to\nbe the basis for development and prosperity, my country has\nworked to achieve and strengthen equality for all its citizens\nand to guarantee their rights. This has been stressed in the\ngreat green document on human rights and basic freedoms.\nThe freedom enhancement act was promulgated in 1991, and\na large number of international agreements in the area of\nhuman rights have also been ratified. In addition, the\nInternational Committee on the Qaddafi Award for Human\nRights has been established.\nThe restructuring and reform of the United Nations and\nthe democratization of the composition of its organs have\nbecome a necessity if the United Nations is to be enabled to\nmeet international demands, become more responsive to the\nneeds of Member States and more effective in its work, in\nconsonance with the goals of the Charter.\nMy country has been following with interest the current\nattempts at reforming the United Nations in the economic\nand social fields. We welcome the decision on the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the streamlining\nof its agenda. We hope that the ad hoc working group\nestablished for this purpose will reach a conclusion that\nstrikes a balance between, and safeguards the interests of, all\nMember States.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s proposals in his report entitled\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" are a valuable contribution towards\nenhancing the Organization\u2019s ability to meet the challenges\nof the coming period. My country welcomed those\nproposals, and has taken note of the two resolutions adopted\nby the General Assembly in this respect.\nIn carrying out the recommendations of the Agenda for\nPeace, the United Nations should be guided by the principles\nof the Charter and especially by its respect for the\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of\nStates, as stipulated in resolution 47/120, and confirmed by\nresolution 47/233 adopted by the General Assembly just last\nmonth. The strengthening of the General Assembly so that\nit may perform the role entrusted to it by the Charter should\nbe one of the main objectives in reforming the United\nNations. The Security Council, which Member States have\nentrusted with the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity on their behalf, should carry out its duties in a\nmanner that fully conforms with the principles and purposes\nof the Charter and with international laws and norms. The\nCouncil should also improve its methods of work and adopt\nan objective course of action. It should not apply double\nstandards when dealing with issues of world peace and\nsecurity. The present facts on the ground necessitate an\nenlargement of the membership of the Security Council not\nthrough partial measures but through radical solutions that\nreflect the increase in the membership of the United Nations\nand take into consideration equal geographical distribution in\naccordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Charter\nand the objectives of General Assembly resolution 47/62.\nWithin the context of the reform process, it is highly\nimportant to review some of the provisions of the Charter\nthat are no longer in keeping with the great changes that\nhave taken place in the international arena. The world\nsituation in 1945 and the situation now are different. This\nrequires the adoption of bold measures in relation to certain\nprovisions of the Charter whose continued existence\nconstitutes a major impediment to the most important role of\nthe United Nations, namely, the maintenance of international\npeace and security. Here, we refer to the veto power in the\nUnited Nations Security Council, which is held by a very\nfew countries. The abolition of this privilege is something\nthat has long been called for; calls for abolition have grown\nover the last few years. The position expressed by many\ncountries, including my country, during the last session of\nthe General Assembly and in other forums, confirms the\nwidespread desire to abolish this privilege and highlights the\nfact that any collective security system that is subject to the\nveto power of some countries cannot be depended upon to\nmaintain international peace and security.\nIn conclusion, as we prepare to celebrate the fiftieth\nanniversary of the United Nations, and as we look forward\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nto the next 50 years, we are duty bound, both as States and\nas peoples, to lay down a strong and just foundation for the\nworld of tomorrow. The world we aspire to is a world free\nfrom conflicts, disputes and wars; a world where the means\nof annihilation and destruction do not exist and where the\nmanifestations of poverty and suffering have long\ndisappeared; a world of security and stability built by people\non the basis of virtue, justice and equality, where democracy\nand human rights are reinforced by the absence of violence,\ninjustice and arbitrary acts; a world where all people have a\ngenuine opportunity to look to the future with optimism and\nto enjoy peace, security and happiness by truly applying the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. In\ncontributing to the achievement of these goals, the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya put forward a proposal designed to deal\nwith and solve many of the problems and issues with which\nmankind is preoccupied. That proposal was circulated in\ndocument A/46/840 which I shall not address but which is\navailable to representatives as an addendum to this\nstatement.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with great pleasure\nthat I congratulate you, Sir, and the Republic of Guyana, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. In so doing, I wish to reaffirm the\ntraditional ties of friendship between Brazil and Guyana. I\nam certain that you will contribute to making this session of\nthe General Assembly a landmark in the path towards\nprogress and democracy among nations.\nI would also like to express to Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\nrespected jurist from the Republic of Bulgaria and President\nof the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session, our\nrecognition for the work he accomplished.\nThe strong and innovative leadership provided by\nSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will continue to be\na factor in furthering the work of our Organization.\nAt the opening of the debate at this forty-eighth session\nof the General Assembly, we are, once again, being swept\nby the winds of change. A fresh breeze, bringing us the\nmessage that understanding and peace may finally prevail\nover selfish interest, is blowing from the Near East, cradle\nof some of the most valuable moral lessons on which our\nplanetary civilization is built.\nMan\u2019s adventure on Earth, driven by reason and by\ndreams, has unfolded within the tension between self-interest\nand solidarity. In the dialectic interaction between solidarity\nand self-interest which has shaped and continues to shape\nthe destinies of mankind, solidarity has just attained a great\nvictory, allowing us greater optimism about the future and\nabout the possibility of the materialization of the perpetual\npeace of which Immanuel Kant spoke. Indeed, following the\nhigh hopes ushered in by the end of the cold war, we were\nforced to postpone any exclamations of joy as we witnessed\nthe much-heralded new order transform itself into growing\ndisorder, marked by the re-emergence of conflicts rooted in\nparticularisms, which were supposed to be among the closed\nchapters of history.\nWe have noticed that the inherent preoccupations of the\ncold war have shifted from an East-West axis to a North-\nSouth orientation. New concepts have been used to justify\ndiscriminatory acts with repercussions for the countries of\nthe South. Some of these concepts were presented under the\ncloak of humanitarian or moral values, such as the so-called\n\\\"right of intervention\\\" and \\\"good governance\\\"; others are\nrenewed versions of old practices, such as eco-protectionism.\nAt the same time, the countries of the North tightened their\ncontrols on the entry of dispossessed people from the South,\nmany of whom came from former colonies. Thus, peace of\nmind was to be preserved along with the exclusive privileges\nof post-industrial society. At the same time, just when they\nwere enjoying new heights of freedom, some of the peoples\nformerly subjected to authoritarian rule were carried away in\nnationalistic exaltation, the consequences of which continue\nto parade before spectators who are as shocked as they are\npowerless.\nIt was as \\\"glad tidings\\\", in an almost Biblical sense,\nthat the world welcomed the news that peace and\nunderstanding were possible in a region marked up to now\nby pain and conflict. The handshake between Mr. Yitzhak\nRabin and Mr. Yasser Arafat is emblematic of the close of\nthis century, a symbol indicating that history is not over, as\nsome have suggested, but rather that it is just beginning,\nafter a long, dark and turbulent pre-history, in which the\nmark of Cain has always prevailed over the profound desire\nfor lasting peace felt by all peoples.\nIn this same spirit, I reiterate the solidarity of Brazil\nwith the Russian people, who continue to face the challenges\nof the process of democratic transition, which we are\nconfident will succeed in their country.\nIt is therefore with renewed faith in the ability of\nmankind to find solutions to the problems it continuously\ncreates for itself that we begin our work at this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nExactly thirty years ago, another Minister of External\nRelations of Brazil, a career diplomat like myself,\nAmbassador Jo\u00e3o Augusto de Araujo Castro, pointed out that\nthe task of the United Nations could be summed up in what\nhe called the \\\"3 D\u2019s\\\": Disarmament, Development,\nDecolonization. Today, with the virtual elimination of the\nlast remnants of colonialism, I could paraphrase him by\nstating that the international agenda is once again structured\naround three \\\"D\u2019s\\\": Democracy, Development, Disarmament,\nwith their ramifications in the areas of human rights, the\nenvironment and international security.\nThe changes we have witnessed have not been limited\nto the international sphere. Ethical advancements have also\nbeen made in the domestic sphere of countries, where ethics\nhave prevailed over the petty interplay of interests which\nusually makes up day-to-day politics and which leads so\nmany young people to disbelief and to turn away from the\nideal of citizenship, without which man cannot fully realize\nhis calling as a social being. I believe that I can proudly\nassert that my country, Brazil, despite the inherent problems\nof underdevelopment, has placed itself at the forefront of this\n\\\"ethicalization\\\" of political relations, which goes far beyond\nthe almost bureaucratic concept of \\\"good governance\\\".\nWe can still hear the echoes - and the world\u2019s most\nimportant opinion makers did not fail to register them - of\nthe resounding popular campaign which, in perfect harmony\nwith the legislative and judiciary branches of the Brazilian\nGovernment, led to the impeachment of a president.\nThrough an exclusively internal process, which emerged and\ndeveloped within the Brazilian people and their legitimate\nrepresentatives, a rarely seen lesson in citizenship was given,\nby the use of a legal instrument which, though present in\nother countries, had never been implemented to its ultimate\nconsequences as it was in Brazil. In this process the\nBrazilian people counted on the support of a press which,\nwith courage and boldness, put to good use the freedom it\nwas once again enjoying after two decades of authoritarian\nrule.\nIt is with justifiable pride that I am able to state, before\nthis world assembly, that Brazil has etched a mark - and not\na minor one - in the evolution of political institutions. I am\ncertain that the peaceful and strictly legal and constitutional\nmanner in which this transition took place in Brazil will be\na necessary reference in books that may come to be written\nabout the history of democracy in our time. I would like to\nstress that the process which led to this feat - and a feat\nindeed it was - was set in motion and ran its course neither\nas the product of any form of external pressure, nor in\nresponse to any action inspired by standards of governance\nimposed from outside, but solely and exclusively as the\nresult of the deepest sense of citizenship shared by\nBrazilians of every social class.\nSince taking office, President Itamar Franco has\nimposed upon himself and upon the Government he leads\nabsolute respect for the Constitution and for the laws of the\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 3\ncountry and, above all, for the unchanging principles of law\nand ethics. Among the constitutional rights of the human\nbeing and of the citizen are those laid down in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which our Constitution\nincorporates and expands upon. Ensuring respect for those\nrights - in protecting indigenous populations, in safeguarding\nchildren and families, in guaranteeing political freedom and\naccess to justice - has been the determined policy of the\ncurrent Government, and is the challenge we face after a\nlong period in which economic growth and social\ndevelopment did not tread convergent paths.\nWithin an atmosphere of freedom in which the project\nof building an open democratic and pluralistic society is\nmoving forward, we are seeking to solve our macroeconomic\nproblems while steering clear of the authoritarian temptation\nof recourse to technocratic formulas based on closed\ndecision-making structures. Although it may seem, on\noccasion, more efficient, technocracy tends too frequently to\nimpose excessive sacrifices on the poorest and most\nvulnerable sectors of the population. The road we are following -\nthat the Government of President Itamar Franco is following\n- is another, perhaps more complex and arduous one, but\ncertainly one that is more democratic and more capable of\nleading to consensual and sustainable results.\nThe Brazilian Government and society are both aware\nthat the difficult issues we are confronted with in the area of\nhuman rights are deeply intertwined with the social\nimbalances inherited from decades of insensitivity rooted in\nauthoritarian rule. Democracy, human rights and\ndevelopment make up another indissoluble triad. None of\nthose terms can be brought to complete fruition in the\nabsence of the other two; that is why the Brazilian\nGovernment attaches such importance to the resumption of\ngrowth and the expansion of employment along with a fairer\ndistribution of income, the only solid and sustainable basis\nwith which to ensure social development and the full\nrealization of human rights. That is also the reason for the\nimportance attached to programmes, such as the programme\nto combat hunger, which have emerged in our society and\nwhich can count on the full and resolute support of the\nGovernment.\nWe know only too well, however, that problems in the\narea of human rights - to which recent incidents that shocked\nBrazilian society and the world bear witness - cannot wait\nfor development to be consolidated and for welfare to reach\nall of society. At the same time as we seek to solve them\nradically - that is, by attacking their social and economic roots -\nwe must also attend to the more immediate aspects. To this\nend, the Government is determined to act, at different levels,\nunder the inspiration and the guidance of the President, who\nis personally committed to this task.\nTransparency in the decisions and actions of the\nGovernment constitutes an important aspect of Brazilian\npolitics. Such transparency manifests itself in, among other\nactions, the fluid and cooperative dialogue maintained with\nsegments and organizations of society dedicated to the\nstruggle for the observance of human rights in the country.\nThis open and constructive spirit is not restricted, by the\nway, within our own borders: we seek and maintain\ncooperation on issues related to human rights with other\ncountries, intergovernmental and non-governmental\norganizations, with which we are devising new methods of\naction for safeguarding the rule of law and in favour of the\nadequate protection of human rights on the basis of mutual\nrespect.\nWe do not disregard the fact that impunity may turn out\nto be the Achilles\u2019 heel of any policy aimed at the full\nimplementation of human rights and the elimination of\nviolence. For this reason, the President has personally\ndetermined measures - whose implementation he has been\nfollowing - for every case in which the human rights of\nchildren, of indigenous populations, of women or of any\ncitizen have been violated. ln this endeavour, he has the\nsupport of Brazilian society, which will not tolerate impunity\nas it did not tolerate corruption and the breach of ethical\nstandards in politics.\nWith specific reference to indigenous populations, we\nare currently proceeding with the necessary strengthening of\nthe Government\u2019s presence in the Amazon region in order to\nprotect simultaneously the population and the environment,\nboth of which are frequently exposed to predatory activities;\nthese result from an encounter of civilizations that began\nfive centuries ago and extends up to today.\nHere again, the dialectics of solidarity and self-interest\nare at work; the increased effectiveness of actions\nundertaken by the Brazilian Government in the Amazon\nregion, in conformity with the full and irrevocable exercise\nof our sovereignty, is fundamental if we are to ensure the\nprotection and defence of all the region\u2019s inhabitants and, in\nparticular, those of the Brazilian indigenous protected areas,\nwhich amount to the impressive total of over 800,000 square\nkilometres.\nThe special importance we attach to human rights in the\ndomestic sphere is also reflected in our diplomatic action, as\nwas evidenced at the World Conference held in Vienna last\nJune. The nomination of Brazil to chair the drafting\ncommittee of the Conference was both an honour and a\nchallenge; we offered our collaboration with satisfaction with\na view to the Vienna consensus being expressed at the\nhighest and most democratic level. The Vienna Declaration\nand Programme of Action constitute a significant advance in\nthe promotion and protection of human rights, including by\nrefining concepts now unquestionably acknowledged as\nuniversal. By reaffirming the interdependence of all human\nrights, all of which require equal protection, the Declaration\nrecognizes that individual rights become little more than\nlegal fiction if the bearers of such rights and the States\nwhich must guarantee them lack the material resources with\nwhich to ensure them.\nThe promotion and the defence of the democratic\nregime inside each country are not sufficient: a vigorous\neffort of democratization of international relations is\nessential, in conformity with two notable phenomena of\ncurrent times: the wide consensus on the advantages of\nrepresentative democracy and the growing linkage between\nthe domestic and the international spheres. This twofold\nperception leads us of necessity to the recognition that the\ndemocratic ideal is applicable with equal validity to relations\nbetween nations.\nWe note with satisfaction the establishment of a virtual\nconsensus on the need to update the composition of the\nSecurity Council. It is our understanding that the growing\nrole of the Council in matters which affect the fundamental\ninterests of Member States corresponds to the need to ensure\na more representative composition, and so enhance the\nCouncil\u2019s legitimacy and its efficiency. The reform of the\nCouncil must be achieved in such a way as not to aggravate\nfurther the imbalance between developed and developing\ncountries in the decision-making process of the United\nNations. The General Assembly, as the definitive\ndemocratic organ within the United Nations system, must\nplay a decisive role in shaping that process.\nThe democratization of relations between nations\ndemands that the international order protect them and\nguarantee their rights against illicit acts and abuses of power.\nThere can be no democratic society if the rule of law is not\nstrictly observed and if the less powerful are not sheltered\nfrom arbitrary acts by those who wield force and power. In\ntoday\u2019s world, it is no longer admissible to say, in the words\nof Pascal\u2019s well-known aphorism, that \\\"as it was not\npossible to make the righteous mighty, the mighty were\nmade righteous\\\".\nThe material progress of peoples is to a large extent the\nproduct of their own, irreplaceable efforts. It is beyond\ndoubt, however, that such progress is contingent upon the\nprevalence of a favourable external environment. It is\ntherefore imperative that international society, acting in\nsolidarity, encourage the creation of conditions for progress,\nnot for the preservation of privilege.\nApart from its intrinsic importance, the development of\nall nations is the only factor that can genuinely reduce the\nimbalances that are so patently expressed, for instance, in the\ngrowing flow of migrants and refugees. In a global society,\nsocial justice becomes an indispensable condition for\npreventing crises, for alleviating tension, for consolidating\ndemocracy and for promoting human rights.\nIf we are to undertake a wide-ranging exercise of\npreventive diplomacy we must realize that only socially and\nenvironmentally sustainable economic development provides\nan effective means to accomplish our goals.\nIn the pursuit of development the United Nations has a\nfundamental role to play. We must make sure that the\nOrganization will act urgently to impart renewed life to its\ncommitment to development and, therefore, also its\ncapacities in the economic and social field. Imbued with\nthis hope, Brazil has supported and continues to support\nvigorously the initiative of an agenda for development. We\nare confident that the Secretary-General will present us with\na proposal that will be no less innovative, bold and rich in\nideas than was \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\".\nSimilarly, great store is set by the work of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development. Brazil expects\nthe Commission to be an effective tool for putting into effect\nthe commitments undertaken in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.\nIn the same vein we give our wholehearted support to\nthe holding of the World Summit for Social Development,\na most timely initiative of the Government of Chile, a\ncountry to which we are linked by close ties of South\nAmerican brotherhood and partnership in the Rio Group.\nWe should not however be misguided by illusions.\nOnly a dynamic insertion in the cross-currents of trade and\ntechnology will allow developing countries to reap their fair\nshare of the fruits of progress. To that end we advocate a\nstrengthened multilateral trading system that can guarantee\nboth an adequate reward for our effort at trade liberalization\nand a normative framework to discourage protectionism and\nunilateral measures. Today that entails the need for a\nprompt and balanced conclusion of the Uruguay Round,\nwithout discrimination or impositions. The significance of\nthe Uruguay Round projects far beyond its strictly\ncommercial aspects. Its successful outcome will be\ninstrumental in framing an international order that is open\nand propitious for cooperation, thus preventing a splintering\nof economic relations into self-contained blocs.\nThe vigorous involvement of the community of nations\nin the pursuit of development must be consonant with the\nprinciple of State sovereignty. Brazil views the sovereign\nnation-State as the basis for the legal and political\ninternational order. It must not be weakened lest we\nundermine the very basis of international representation and\nof the multilateral system. Attempts to play down the\nprinciple of national sovereignty - which incidentally are\nhardly ever targeted at the more powerful States - would be\na step backwards in the effort towards more democratic\ninternational relations. At a moment when we are building\nthe future multilateral system we should not allow\ndifferences in power among nations to replace the sovereign\nequality of States. The warning sounded by Ruy Barbosa,\nthe distinguished Brazilian jurist and statesman, at the\nSecond Peace Conference of the Hague in 1907, remains\nfully valid. In discussing the composition of the Permanent\nCourt of Arbitration he stressed that if certain proposals\nwere to prevail, then:\n\\\"The great Powers would no longer be more formidable\nonly as a result of the strength of their armies or of\ntheir fleets. They would also enjoy a superior legal\nstatus in the international judicial forum, thus claiming\na privileged situation in the very institution to which\nthe administration of justice among nations is to be\nentrusted.\\\"\nThe international order we seek to build rests also on\na third pillar, that of disarmament. Brazil, along with its\nneighbours and partners in Latin America, particularly\nArgentina, has been making an important contribution to\nadvancing disarmament and international security.\nThe revision of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the\nestablishment and work of the Brazil-Argentina Agency for\nAccounting and Control of Nuclear Material (ABACC) and\nthe Quadripartite Agreement on International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA) Safeguards, which have just been approved\nby the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, thus meeting an\nimportant requirement for ratification, provide the\ninternational community with the guarantees of our\ncommitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\nWe reaffirm our support for the non-proliferation, in all\nits forms, of weapons of mass destruction. In relation to\nchemical weapons, we, with Chile and Argentina, have\nalready signed the Mendoza Declaration in which we\nsolemnly renounced the possession and production of such\nweapons. We were equally active participants in the process\nthat led to the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, signed in Paris\nearly this year.\nWe are gratified by the current observance, although on\na somewhat fragile basis, of a moratorium on nuclear tests.\nWe hope that the climate resulting from this moratorium will\nbring forth the early conclusion, through multilateral\nnegotiations, of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.\nBrazil, as is well known, has been participating in a\nclearly positive and transparent way in the process of\nestablishing the United Nations Register of Conventional\nArms.\nBrazil\u2019s experience in the field of peace-building and\nconfidence-building is noteworthy. Brazil shares almost\n17,000 kilometres of land borders with 10 different\nneighbouring countries. No other nation has had\nuninterrupted relations of peace and cooperation for so long\nand with so many neighbouring States. Very few countries\nspend as little on arms - as a percentage of national product -\nas Brazil.\nAt the same time Brazil does not renounce its right to\nmaintain, in good harmony with its neighbours and partners,\nan adequate and legitimate defence capacity. Nor does it\nrenounce its right to have access to technology necessary for\nthe well-being of the Brazilian people.\nBy undertaking firm and unambiguous commitments in\nthe field of non-proliferation and disarmament, Brazil\nbelieves it is entitled to expect from its more developed\npartners unimpeded access to high technology, if necessary\non a commercial basis.\nRecent history gives proof that, despite persistent and\nserious shortcomings, United Nations peace-keeping\noperations are important for overcoming situations of\nconflict, some of which are quite old, complex and delicate.\nThe need for an improved conceptual framework for peace-\nkeeping operations must be kept under constant review by\nthe General Assembly. It is expected that the United\nNations will contribute with sober effectiveness to\nmaintaining peace and security wherever they may be\nthreatened. Brazil currently participates with a significant\ncontingent of military observers in United Nations peace-\nkeeping efforts. We intend to expand our presence in this\nfield and we are actively examining ways and means to do\nthis.\nWithin that context it is essential to rectify the serious\npolitical and strategic mistake of envisaging the South as an\narea of international instability. Quite the contrary, various\nregions such as Latin America provide examples of stable\nrelations of cooperation based on mutual trust, as illustrated\nby the vigorous processes of Latin American integration\nwhich, far beyond their mercantile aspects, are the material\nexpression of a political project aimed at international\ncooperation and solidarity. Such processes, including that of\nthe Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), are in\nstark contrast with the trends of fragmentation seen in other\nparts of the world.\nYet another clear demonstration of the potential for\ncooperation is taking shape in the Community of Portuguese-\nSpeaking Countries. Far more than a means of expression,\n\\\"lusiphonia\\\" is the hallmark of a frame of mind, a form of\nbeing, a way of life predicated on tolerance and open\nrelations among different peoples.\nThe Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South\nAtlantic reinforces our links to sister nations in Africa. The\nenhancement of political and economic relations within the\nZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic is a\ngoal towards which we are determined to work, having\nregard, among other issues, to the constitution of a vast area\nfree of the nuclear threat. We furthermore expect to have\nthe pleasure of celebrating the full admission to the South\nAtlantic community of a democratic and united South Africa,\nfree forever from the scourge of racism.\nThe historic speech delivered by Mr. Nelson Mandela\njust a few days ago from this same rostrum warrants the\nexpectation and confirms the idea that in spite of remaining\nobstacles the process of democratization in South Africa is\nnow irreversible.\nWe are forced to admit that serious areas of tension\ncontinue to exist in the world. By virtue of our historical\nties of friendship, cooperation and cultural kinship with\nAngola, the situation in that country is of particular concern\nto us. The international community, through the United\nNations, has a fundamental role to play in the defence of\ndemocracy in Angola and in the utter rejection of the use of\nforce as a means of achieving political gains. Peace must\nprevail in Angola in full compliance with the Bicesse\nAccords and all the relevant resolutions of the Security\nCouncil.\nWe remain gravely concerned about the situation of\nhuman rights and democracy in Haiti. The prospect for a\nprompt solution to the crisis in that country is high on our\nagenda. We look forward to the return of President Jean-\nBertrand Aristide on 30 October.\nThe restoration of peace in the former Yugoslavia is a\npriority for the international community in order to bring to\nan end the suffering of the populations involved in that\nconflict. A willingness to achieve agreements acceptable to\nall parties must prevail in Geneva, as in the capitals of the\nformer federation. That willingness alone can enable the\nUnited Nations to play its irreplaceable role in bringing\npeace to that region.\nOur example, and our response to these challenges, will\nframe the future order to which we all aspire: an order that\nis democratic, stable, disarmed and committed to the\nmaterial and spiritual development of all nations.\nThe humanistic vision that inspires us was forcefully\nexpressed by a Brazilian poet and diplomat,\nJo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto, in these words:\n\\\"Learn this: that man is the best measure always,\nAnd more: that life, not death, is the measure of man.\\\"\n"

The fact that he was\nselected to guide our deliberations signifies the confidence\nthat Member States have in his well-known professional\nqualities. I am sure that, under his guidance, the present\nsession of the Assembly will tackle the issues on its agenda\nwith courage and realism.\nI would also like to place on record our appreciation for\nthe competence and wisdom of his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, and for his outstanding\nperformance in steering the work of the General Assembly\nduring an eventful year.\nMy delegation takes joyful pride in welcoming Andorra,\nthe Czech Republic, Eritrea, Macedonia, Monaco and the\nSlovak Republic to the family of nations. We believe that\ntheir admission represents yet another milestone in further\nconsolidating the universality of this Organization. There is\nno doubt that our community will be enriched and\nstrengthened by their contribution to the realization of the\nideals of the United Nations.\nThe excitement and hopefulness of 1989 already seem\nto be part of a distant past. We both welcomed and were\nunprepared for the events that marked the dramatic end of\nthe cold war. They generated a tidal wave of optimism\nabout the future of international relations. Fervent talk about\na rapidly changing world was the order of the day when we\nentered the present decade. Little was done, however, to\ndetermine and shape the dynamics and scope of the change.\nIt was more or less taken for granted that this change would\nturn out to be for the better. That did not prove to be the\ncase. Accordingly, the creation of a new, desirable\ninternational system continues to top the political agenda as\nthe most challenging task of our times.\nThe past 12 months have demonstrated yet again that\nthe new world in the making might at times be as dangerous\nas the old, if not worse in certain respects. Nevertheless, we\nshould resist the impulse to indulge in a dark pessimism for\nwhich there can be no legitimate cause. The crucial phase\nof history we are going through calls for reflection and\npositive action, not a defeatist mood. The international\ncommunity should not stand by in desperation and watch\nconditions deteriorate. It must display the will to redirect\nthe course of history towards our expectations. There\ndefinitely exists a political space for constructive initiatives\nand a basis for cooperative action to that end.\nIt is the United Nations which defines and guards that\npolitical space. Indeed, the United Nations is the foremost\nsymbol of modern internationalism. In these turbulent post-\ncold-war years, hardly a day passes without the Organization\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 35\nbeing called upon to take the lead on some important task.\nThese tasks include missions for preserving or restoring\npeace and security, the upholding of the rule of law, and\nmissions to ensure the survival of mankind, to help save the\nenvironment, to combat social scourges and to rescue the so-\ncalled failing societies.\nSince the cold war drew to a close and the conflicts of\nthe transition era rose to the fore, United Nations\npeace-keeping operations have undergone considerable\nexpansion in terms of their functions, size, geographical area\nand degree of complexity. This process has occurred in\ntandem with the rapid evolution of the international\nlandscape. The same background conditions have prompted\nthe emergence of preventive diplomacy, peace- enforcement\nand peace-building as new concepts awaiting urgent\ntranslation into practical and mutually supportive instruments\nat the disposal of the international community. Turkey\u2019s\nresponse to this urgency is reflected in our contribution to\npeace-keeping operations\nAs highlighted in the Secretary-General\u2019s report entitled\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), effectively managing of\nthe crises currently confronting us and responding adequately\nto the challenges ahead call for the elaboration of a shared\nvision for the future of our Organization.\nIn this connection, the focus of priority attention should\nbe the Security Council. Today, the prestige and credibility\nof the United Nations depend more than ever on the\neffectiveness of that principal body. There is a widespread\ncall for the Security Council to become more responsive to\nthe needs of the current international scene. This can be\nmade possible only by making the Council more\nrepresentative of the new geopolitical realities. In other\nwords, the post-cold-war environment requires a fresh\napproach towards the Council\u2019s renovation and restructuring.\nHence, the discussion on the twin themes of equitable\nrepresentation and membership enlargement is very timely.\nTurkey firmly believes that enlarging the Security\nCouncil membership would enhance its effectiveness.\nEnlargement should not be conceived of only as an increase\nin the number of members, but should also envisage the\ncreation of a new category of seats to be held by States that\ncould be qualified as semi-permanent members.\nSemi-permanent membership in the Council could rotate\namong a specific number of States designated according to\ncertain objective criteria: population; geopolitical posture;\neconomic potential; record of contribution to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security; and\nequitable geographical distribution. Since Turkey fully\nmeets these criteria, it considers itself qualified as a\ncandidate for that new category of membership.\nA Security Council more responsive, representative,\ntransparent and accountable is a requirement inherent in the\nspirit of Article 24 of the Charter. Hence, the\ndemocratization of its structure would ensure more active\nparticipation in the Council\u2019s work. The moral ground for\nthe full implementation of the Council\u2019s resolutions would\nthereby be strengthened.\nFew, if any, would contest the fact that it was the\ntragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina that dispelled the\neuphoria prevalent during the earlier period of the post-\ncold-war era. Genocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" were the\nhallmarks of the tragedy. They were conducted with\nimpunity. We could neither halt, nor roll back the Serbian\naggression. Nor could we alleviate, in earnest the suffering\nof the survivors.\nThe example of a civic State, embracing all its citizens\nas equals, irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion, was\ngiven to us in Bosnia where a mature multicultural\ncivilization had evolved over many centuries. No lament\nover its destruction at the hands of ethnic chauvinism could\nbe exaggerated. Moreover, denying the Bosnians the means\nfor their legitimate self-defence amounts to a failure in due\nsupport for democracy against tyranny. A most serious blow\nhas been dealt to the moral essence of international law and\nto the contemporary principles of conduct among nations.\nAny document endorsing the consequences of\nexpansionism, genocide and \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" cannot usher\nin real peace. No peace throughout history has been lasting\nwhen based on rewarding injustice, aggression and racism.\nWe cannot relieve our conscience by fabricating realpolitik\nexcuses for our inaction and silence. Appeasement is no\npolicy, but partnership in wrongdoing.\nThe stakes in Bosnia are much higher than those related\nto the survival of the Bosnian State and its people. They\ninclude the validity of our hope to do away with ethnic and\nreligious warfare in the future. The betrayal of Bosnia as a\nmulticultural, multi-ethnic State, invalidates this hope - and\nwith it the fundamental principles of our Organization. If\nwe allow dictatorship and adventurism to get away with the\ncrimes they have committed in Bosnia, the post-cold-war\ndisorder may worsen. Continued denial of the right of the\nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to defend itself\naggravates the responsibility of the international community\nfor what is happening there. Should Bosnia and\nHerzegovina disintegrate, not only the Balkans and Europe,\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nbut the whole world, will eventually suffer the bitter\nafter-effects.\nTurkey will continue to pursue actively the course of\njustice and legitimacy to support the brave people of Bosnia\nand Herzegovina in their struggle for survival and\ndemocracy.\nThe sinister success of Serbian expansionism in Bosnia\nhas emboldened aggressors elsewhere. A tragedy of similar\nproportions is occurring in the Caucasus, where Armenians\nhave occupied a fifth of Azerbaijani territory. Peace and\nstability in a sensitive region neighbouring Turkey has been\nseriously undermined. Security Council resolutions 822\n(1993) and 853 (1993), calling for the immediate,\nunconditional and complete withdrawal of the occupation\nforces, are being ignored.\nIt should be borne in mind that short-term military\nopportunism is not compatible with long-term interests.\nMoreover, it is fraught with unpredictable dangers. Neither\nin the Balkans nor in the Caucasus - nor, for that matter,\nanywhere else - will Turkey ever accept the acquisition of\nterritory by force. Unless such gross violations of\ninternational law are prevented and the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter vigorously upheld, the present\nturmoil and confusion cannot be replaced by a just and\npeaceful order.\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that Turkey strongly\nendorses the observations made by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his statement on 30 August\nlast, at the sixty-sixth session of the Institute of International\nLaw in Milan. There he appropriately referred to ultra-\nnationalism and micro-nationalism as two of the greatest\ndangers menacing today\u2019s international society. He\nunderlined that, by strengthening the nation State as the main\nsubject of international law, multilateralism preserves the\nworld community from these two great perils. His\nadmonition that\n\\\"Ultra-nationalism today may still be a temptation, at\ntimes, for a number of major Powers nostalgic for the\nperiod of hegemony\\\"\nis of particular relevance at this juncture of post-cold-war\ndevelopments.\nIndeed, the darkening shadows of ultra-nationalism and\nmicro-nationalism, ethnic chauvinism and neo-racism have\nloomed like phantoms behind the scenes in the crises that\nhave erupted during the last two years. The international\ncommunity has to cure itself of these diseases. We should\nnot let irredentist, hegemonic tendencies plague our future.\nThe newly emerging geopolitical pluralism of Eurasia has to\nbe kept alive with a moral commitment to the quest for\nglobal democratic interdependence.\nMost of the threats to international peace in our time\nare bred in climates of intolerance. We have to develop a\nnew mind-set for the recognition and acknowledgment of\nother peoples\u2019 right to be different. We have to enlarge our\ncapacity for give and take.\nTolerance is the foundation of civil society. To build\na just and peaceful world order, such societies must\nproliferate. To that end, we need to promote a culture of\ntolerance all over the world.\nIn this spirit, and as a follow-up to resolution 47/124,\nTurkey will submit during the current session a draft\nresolution proposing the proclamation of 1995 as the United\nNations Year for Tolerance. Adoption of that draft\nresolution would help to accelerate the pace of the efforts\nmade in the struggle against all forms of fanaticism,\nfundamentalism, discrimination and persecution.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 37\nTolerance and social development are correlated\nconcepts. Accordingly, my Government attaches great\nimportance to concerted action at the global level aimed at\nsolving social problems and easing the tensions they cause.\nHence, we are amply satisfied that the Chilean initiative for\nthe convening in March 1995 of a World Summit for Social\nDevelopment has borne fruit. Turkey will prepare for this\nSummit in earnest, and looks forward to contributing to its\nsuccess.\nIn this connection, Turkey welcomes the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s latest report on the work of the organization, in\nwhich he courageously addresses the gravity of the situation\nstemming from the difficulty in raising funds for\ndevelopment aid experienced since the end of the cold war.\nHe accurately observes that the poorer countries no longer\nhold the same interest for the rich as they did in the previous\ndecades of ideological competition. My Government\nbelieves that activities for development are just as important\nas peace-keeping operations. Indeed, it is those activities,\nincluding their humanitarian assistance dimension, which\nprovide the foundations for global peace and security.\nTurkey, stretching its budgetary means to the utmost,\ncontinues to be increasingly active as a donor and\ncontributor in the fields of economic and humanitarian\nsupport and solidarity.\nSince the beginning of 1992 we have implemented an\neconomic assistance package amounting to $2,893 million.\nThe package includes technical assistance, project financing,\ntraining grants and soft loans, made available to 32 countries\nin four continents. We are firmly committed to continuing\nour efforts in this domain. To increase efficiency in terms\nof coordination, we have set up the Turkish International\nCooperation Agency.\nOver the same period 28 countries in three continents,\nstricken by natural and/or man-made disasters, have received\nhumanitarian aid worth a total of $213 million from Turkey,\nin cash or in kind, as well as various forms of relief and\naccommodation for refugees.\nOffering as they do a gloomy general picture, the past\n12 months are nevertheless not totally bereft of reasons for\noptimism, which include: the processes culminating in the\nrestoration of democracy in Haiti and Cambodia; the positive\ndevelopments leading towards the building of a democratic,\nunited, free and non-racial South Africa; and the peaceful\nevolution of Eritrea to independence. A new diplomacy for\ndemocracy seems to be making headway. All of us must\nbring our full energies to bear on this phenomenon so that\nit may gain momentum. That momentum, in its turn, will\ngive impetus to the consolidation of peace, because\ndemocracies seldom fight each other.\nThe only way to advance towards democracy is\nprogressive and sustained democratization. The distance\ncovered in this process is measured by the degree of respect\nfor human rights and the rule of law. The convening of the\nWorld Conference on Human Rights earlier this year enabled\nthe international community to identify clearly the\nindispensable common denominators needed in the building\nof pluralistic civil societies. The Conference re-emphasized\nthe importance of the global task of promoting and\nprotecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and\nconfirmed the commitment of the international community\nto securing the full and universal enjoyment of those rights\nthrough increased and sustained international cooperation and\nsolidarity.\nThe Vienna Declaration includes a comprehensive\ndefinition of terrorism as any activity aiming at the\ndestruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and\ndemocracy, threatening the territorial integrity of States and\ndestabilizing legitimately constituted Governments. We\nstrongly endorse the call by the Conference to continue\ntaking the necessary steps to prevent and combat terrorism.\nThe historic breakthrough achieved in the Middle East\npeace process holds the promise of concord and cooperation\nnot only between the Palestinians, Israel and their Arab\nneighbours, but on a much wider regional scale. Its positive\nripple effects may set in motion multi-dimensional dynamics\nthat could transform an entire area, stretching from the\nAtlantic to the Gulf and from the eastern Mediterranean to\nthe Indian Ocean, into one of harmony, dialogue and\nco-prosperity.\nAs a country that neighbours the Middle East, has a\nrecord of constructive involvement in the region\u2019s affairs and\ngood traditional ties with all the parties to this dispute,\nTurkey hails with the utmost satisfaction this momentous\nshift from enmity towards reconciliation.\nThe momentum so gained should be fully utilized.\nIrreversibility of the process is not enough; the process must\nadvance at an accelerated pace towards the ultimate\nobjectives defined in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973).\nThe wise, far-sighted and courageous architects who\ndesigned this blueprint for rebuilding amity and peace in the\nMiddle East may, as ever, rest assured of Turkey\u2019s firm\n38 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nsupport for and contribution to their mission. We are\ncommitted to assisting their endeavours in every way.\nThree years after the outbreak of the Gulf crisis the\npeople of Iraq are still subjected to hardship. This\nregrettable situation results from the Baghdad Government\u2019s\nreluctance to comply fully with the requirements of the\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to the Gulf War\nsettlement. Compliance would tangibly demonstrate Iraq\u2019s\ninterest in resuming its place in the international community.\nHowever, we cannot remain indifferent to the suffering\nof the people of Iraq. My Government firmly believes that\nthe international community must urgently consider\nimaginative ways to break this vicious circle.\nTurkey has been forthcoming in providing Iraq with\nhumanitarian assistance since 1991. By the same token, we\nhave decided to launch a new humanitarian assistance\nprogramme worth $13.5 million aimed at the entire needy\npopulation of northern Iraq. Our approach is without\nprejudice to Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.\nAlong with the Iraqi people, a number of countries,\nparticularly Iraq\u2019s neighbours, are also exposed to the\nadverse effects of the continued economic sanctions. The\ninternational community should also devise a set of measures\naimed at redressing their mounting losses.\nMy Government is concerned over the worsening\nsituation in Jammu and Kashmir. We wish to see the\ndispute between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir issue\nresolved through the resumption of sustained dialogue. To\nthat end, Turkey will continue to support Pakistan\u2019s\nendeavours in pursuit of a negotiated settlement of this\nlong-standing problem.\nAs to Cyprus, it is certainly not my intention to indulge\nin a consideration of the past. I am quite aware that this is\nnot the time, not would it be profitable, to enter into\nrecriminations over history. What is important is to\nunderstand the issue correctly while acknowledging the facts\nunderlying the present problems and the profound mistrust\nbetween the two communities. We must take careful\naccount of those problems and the present difficulties, but\nwe must build for the future.\nToday the Cyprus question has reached a stage where\nthe common desire and purpose of the international\ncommunity is to promote an early and comprehensive\nsolution. To that end, the Secretary-General continues his\nmission of good offices. As ever, Turkey supports the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts aimed at bringing about a freely\nnegotiated, just and viable settlement. No doubt the\nrealization of that objective requires a display of goodwill,\nunderstanding and patience by both negotiating partners in\nthe island. Moreover, it also calls for a carefully balanced\nand determined approach in order to heal the profound\nmistrust driving the parties apart. It is with such\nconsiderations that Turkey has endorsed the concept of\nconfidence-building measures, the scope and contents of\nwhich must be acceptable to both communities.\nWhatever the reasons that may still divide the two\nsides, the negotiating process must continue. It is high time\nfor all concerned to display realism and act with vision in\nsearch of a negotiated, durable solution.\nAt present a campaign is under way for early general\nelections in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We\nearnestly hope that once the elections are over the Turkish\nCypriot side will again be able to continue to play its\nconstructive role in the negotiating process.\nTurkey lies at the very epicentre of several regions\nmaking up the most turbulent part of the Northern\nhemisphere. We are actively engaged in the post-cold-war\nsearch for new approaches to build peace through\nmultilateral action. Our objective is to reinforce the\ninternational security system. Only the United Nations can\nprovide legitimacy to regional arrangements and institutions\nshould the latter decide to act in the fields of militarily\nbacked preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and peace\nenforcement.\nAll three of those categories of action are in demand on\nTurkey\u2019s periphery. My Government deploys all of its\navailable assets to help defuse and resolve these crises. We\nstrive to create and consolidate interlinked areas of solidarity\nand processes of cooperation.\nIn that effort we proceed from two basic tenets. First,\nwe believe that the evolution of the international\nenvironment towards a better future is not only desirable but,\nin certain conditions, also possible. Secondly, we are of the\nopinion that such a future may materialize only through the\nreinforcement of respect for the rule of law along with the\nuniversal observance and implementation of the principles of\ndemocracy and tolerance.\nThe United Nations was created to preserve peace.\nHowever, it cannot be expected to help resolve the collective\nsecurity problems of our times unless its Member States are\nwilling and prepared to assume their responsibilities as\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 39\nupholders and enforcers of the United Nations Charter and\nthe contemporary norms of international behaviour.\nWith the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the\nOrganization to be celebrated in two years\u2019 time, all of us\nhere must admit that the main objective defined in the\nCharter, namely, \\\"to save succeeding generations from the\nscourge of war,\\\" has not yet been achieved. In the\nstrengthening of peace and security our immediate task is\nfully to mobilize the potential of the United Nations for\nresolving regional and local conflicts, which have\nproliferated since the end of the cold war.\nFor the future well-being of all nations, it is high time\nto act with the vision and forbearance that peace requires.\nTurkey stands committed to continue making its own\ncontribution to attaining that objective.\n"

        "file_text": "On\nbehalf of the Federated States of Micronesia, I am honoured\nthis morning to address the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session, and I bring the warm greetings of our\nPresident and our people.\nGiven the many challenges facing the Organization and\nthe entire world in the coming year, we are pleased by your\nelection, Mr. President. You have our confidence and\nsupport as you assume this high office, so ably discharged\nby your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who\nenjoyed our respect and gratitude.\nSpecial recognition must also be given to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, under whose\nleadership the United Nations has taken difficult steps in a\nprocess of redefinition and reorganization, which is\nnecessary if we are to take advantage of the opportunities\npresented by the new world order and work together in the\ninterests of all mankind.\nDuring the past year we have seen the membership of\nthe United Nations draw ever closer to the goal of\nuniversality. We thus congratulate the Czech Republic, the\nSlovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra, and to each of\nthem we extend a welcome and pledge cooperation and\nfriendship.\nOur people are deeply saddened by the loss of life and\nthe suffering caused by the earthquake in India last month,\nand we express to the Indian people our sincere sympathy\nand pledge to them that we will participate in any effort\nundertaken by this Organization.\nNot many years ago, the appropriate role of the\n\\\"micro-States\\\" within the world community was to be seen\nbut seldom heard, and even to be excluded from many\nforums. In our own small island developing State, we, as\nthe body politic of a classic \\\"micro-State\\\", hesitated to assert\nour views on international affairs, thinking that a small\nnation could not make a difference in or have an impact\nupon the resolution of global issues.\nToday I draw attention to a significant but less\nnoticeable feature of the new order. Throughout history,\ninternational relations have been conducted on a competitive\nbasis, where power and size made a difference. But I am\nhappy to note that things have changed for the better, that a\nchange has begun to take place; and I think it is one that has\ngathered increased momentum even within the past few\nyears. Nations large and small, in the process of working\ntogether under the Charter, have begun to focus their\nattention and direct their efforts along the lines of\ncommonality of interests and problems - and not merely to\npay lip-service. Indeed there is a growing, genuine\nphenomenon, which is seen partly in the unfolding of events\nin New York, but even more clearly in the impressive\noutcomes of the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment and the recent World Conference on Human\nRights. Another sign is the entire world community\u2019s keen\n\nanticipation of the upcoming Conference on Population and\nDevelopment and the World Summit for Social\nDevelopment.\nI do not mean to suggest a disappearance of national\ninterests; but, across a wide spectrum of social, development\nand even security matters, there is a growing recognition that\ncommon interests give strength to new alliances on an\ninclusive rather than exclusive basis. Thus, there is good\nreason for continued progress towards self-determination\namong peoples, since they can now be confident that they\nwill not be alone in addressing the great difficulties of\nstarting out. For similar reasons, many of the \\\"micro-States\\\"\nhave concluded recently that membership in this\nOrganization is imperative, despite the burdens and\nresponsibilities involved.\nAs this session of the General Assembly proceeds, we\nare becoming aware of the changes in the Organization in\nterms of organization, administration and policy. There may\nbe some who doubt that Members have the will or\ncommitment to achieve consensus on these changes and to\nre-establish the proper financial basis for a United Nations\nthat can be responsive to the present. I submit, however,\nthat any such doubts must be dispelled during our work here\nin the coming months, for we simply cannot afford to fail.\nThe United Nations is no longer an optional feature of the\ninternational community. The common concerns of mankind\nin the great issues to which I alluded earlier cannot be\naddressed from behind national fences. And so, I appeal to\nall Members to commit themselves fully to reaching at this\nsession the goal of preparing the United Nations to become\nthe central instrument through which we can work to secure\nthe future well-being of our peoples.\nI believe that the direct experience of my country\nwithin our brief time as a Member provides unmistakable\nevidence of the strength of concerted, international action.\nOnly a few years ago, having emerged from colonialism, our\nbest hopes for development lay in dependence for an\nindefinite period on the generosity of a few friends, chief\namong them the United States. Moreover, as inhabitants of\nsmall, low-lying islands, we were helpless in the face of the\nlooming threat of sea-level rise and other natural disasters\ncaused by human-induced climate change.\nToday, through the work of this body and with our\nparticipation, the special development needs and\nenvironmental concerns of all small island developing States\nare being carefully addressed in a number of settings,\nincluding the Conventions on climate change and\nbiodiversity and the follow-up activities of the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED). The early work of the Commission on\nSustainable Development promises attention to our problems,\nas can be seen in the upcoming first Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates.\nAll this is not happening because of an outburst of\ncharitable sympathy by the developed countries, but rather\nin the context of addressing a complex of issues in which\npeoples everywhere have a stake. Herein, I think, lies the\nreal strength and value of the United Nations - to us and to\nall.\nDuring the past year, my Government has found\nencouragement in the ways in which this Organization as a\nwhole recognizes the difficulties that small States encounter\nas they try to participate fully in its work. We deeply\nappreciate the opportunities afforded to us through the\ncontribution of Members to voluntary funds that have\nenabled our participation in important functions. We also\nacknowledge the instances where calls by small States for\nthe holding of meetings here in New York to make our\npresence possible have been heard. Furthermore, we\nappreciate that, whenever possible, special measures for our\nbenefit - such as limiting the number of simultaneous\nmeetings - are being taken.\nFor our part, small States are now more often coming\ntogether on common issues to speak with one voice for\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency. Here, I cite the\nAlliance of Small Island States as a successful example on\nthe issue of climate change and other UNCED-related\nmatters. In a more general sense, the regional groups\noperate to the benefit of small States, affording us\nopportunities of access to elected positions by virtue of\nallocations and the principle of rotation. I am sure there are\nother factors favourable to us that I have failed to mention\nhere.\nYet, even with all this, I must state that we are very\nhard pressed to participate in the broad range of United\nNations activities, both financially and owing to the sheer\nvolume and complexity of those activities. For this reason,\nand because so many other Members are in similar\nsituations, I propose that the United Nations, as part of its\nreorganization efforts, undertake a comprehensive\nexamination of the obstacles that exist to the full\nparticipation of small States with a view towards identifying\ninstitutional rather than ad hoc solutions. After all,\nachieving universality in the United Nations would be a\nhollow accomplishment so long as a significant number of\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 3\nMembers remain incapable of reaching their effective\npotential within the Organization. We look forward to\naddressing this issue during the course of the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nMy country is a member of the South Pacific Forum,\nan organization of Governments of Pacific island countries\nwhich, each year prior to this date, meets to address matters\nof concern to our region and to provide an expression of our\njoint views on many issues before this body. I wish to state\nour complete solidarity with that expression, contained in the\ncommuniqu\u00e9 from our recent meeting in the Republic of\nNauru, which will be presented for incorporation in the\nrecords of this Assembly.\nThe Forum members have been outspoken in opposing\nthe testing of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction. Our optimism ran very high at the Nauru\nmeeting because it seemed that at last the nuclear Powers\nhad found the resolve to bring this dangerous chapter of\nhistory to an end. Now, with reports of a recent test by one\nof them, the Federated States of Micronesia is deeply\nconcerned that the great progress made towards achieving a\ncomprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will be reversed. We\ncall on all nuclear Powers not to treat this recent aberration\nas an incentive to turn backwards, but rather to restore and\nhold to their collective discipline.\nThe issue of fundamental human rights is interwoven\ninto every aspect of the activities undertaken by this body.\nFor too long many Governments have been content to avoid\nconfronting it directly as a matter of multilateral\nresponsibility. I am glad to say that we sense some\nimprovement in the situation despite continuing occurrences\nof the most repugnant kinds of human rights violations.\nIn this decade, we have witnessed unprecedented\nchanges in world conditions, brought about in part by a\ngrowing unanimity of resolve among peoples to express and\nexercise their fundamental human rights. Recently,\nprominent States have been dismantled, leading to the\nformation of other States that afford broader opportunities\nfor the expression of these rights. Sadly, at the same time,\nother States continue to go to great lengths to suppress them.\nThe world finds itself rejoicing in newly established\nfreedoms but also feeling deep revulsion over atrocities and\nrepression of shocking magnitude. If any lesson emerges\nfrom this dichotomy, it must be that isolated progress is not\nenough and that fundamental human rights issues can no\nlonger be relegated to the background in a set of supposedly\nhigher multilateral priorities. Rather, human rights must be\nthe cornerstone of our work, which must be guided by the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\nAccordingly, my Government expresses its support for\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action agreed\nupon at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna\nin June this year. We support the adoption of that\nDeclaration by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession.\nIn keeping with the principles of that Declaration, I\nwish to affirm my Government\u2019s strong and unconditional\nsupport for the universality of human rights and for the\neffective multilateral instruments that give meaning and\ndefinition to the concept.\nAs an early priority, our new nation has undertaken a\nclose examination of the existing instruments with a view to\nfreely assuming obligations under them, as is consistent with\nour Constitution. As a first step, we have acceded to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, and we anticipate\nfurther action on other instruments as well.\nOne of the very important concerns that is interlinked\nwith all our Government\u2019s hopes for a better future is the\nrights of women. We fully support the development of\neffective new instruments in the cause of women\u2019s rights in\norder to secure their protection against discrimination and\nabuse.\nAs a nation comprised entirely of indigenous peoples,\nmy Government also expresses its solidarity with all\nindigenous peoples of the world and particularly those\nsubjected to deprivation of their fundamental human rights\nwithin their own homelands.\nIn this the International Decade for the Eradication of\nColonialism it is important that this body redouble its efforts\nto ensure that the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories are given every opportunity to exercise\ntheir right to self-determination and self-government. While\nthe obstacles to self-determination for the remaining\nTerritories are minor compared to those that are being\nconfronted so dramatically in Eastern Europe and in\nPalestine, it remains our moral responsibility to support the\nright to self-determination for all peoples under colonial\nadministration.\nToday, the enlarged membership of the United Nations\nis in itself strong testimony to the success of decolonization;\nlet us hark back to our own earlier struggles and recommit\nourselves to the complete elimination of colonialism.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMy Government welcomes the establishment of the\nInternational Tribunal, and the recent election of its\nmembers, to try perpetrators of war crimes in the former\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Still, we would support the\nestablishment of a permanent international human rights\ntribunal. The independent, juridical composition of any such\nbody should place it above concerns regarding political\nintervention while denying human rights violators any refuge\nfrom defined international responsibility.\nThe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia\nattaches great importance to the issue of fundamental human\nrights, and will continue to participate in the work of this\nbody towards a world community in which all peoples live\nwithout threat of encroachment upon these fundamental\nrights.\nIt has been well established by actions of this body that\nthe right to development is itself a fundamental human right.\nBut to recognize a right is one thing: to secure the exercise\nof that right is much more difficult. A great deal is said and\ndone here at the United Nations every year to address the\nneeds of developing countries and peoples, not to mention\nthe considerable resources that are mobilized bilaterally\ntowards that end. Yet we continue to see wide variations in\nthe degree of effectiveness of that assistance and in the\nresults of efforts by developing countries themselves.\nThis has led an increasing number of us to question\nwhether there might not exist a number of identifiable\nfactors that prevent development efforts from achieving\nsuccess. If those factors could be defined with precision and\nrecognized where they are present, it might well be possible\nto attain significant increases in economies and outcomes.\nOn Papua New Guinea\u2019s welcome suggestion, and with its\nwelcome leadership - and after considerable discussion and\nextensive exchanges of views between eminent leaders in the\ndeveloping world - this matter has been placed before the\nAssembly as agenda item 151, entitled \\\"United Nations\ninitiative on opportunity and participation\\\". We shall join\nothers in sponsoring a draft resolution to be presented under\nthis item and calling for a comprehensive, systematic and\nthorough study of the encumbrances to full opportunity and\nparticipation in development, with particular reference to the\neconomies of developing countries. If properly supported\nand carried out, this initiative would make possible\nsignificant breakthroughs in the effort to secure this\nimportant and fundamental human right, with equality and\nequity for all.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia pays a tribute to the\nenlightened men and women who gave life to the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED) process and focused the world\u2019s attention on the\nneed to begin replacing wasteful and polluting practices with\nsustainable development. This movement is especially\nwell-timed for my country, since our development planning\nis still in the early stages and, as a consequence, and with\nthe encouragement and support of the world community, we\nnow have in place a national environmental management\nstrategy that provides an essential complement to our\ndevelopment-planning efforts.\nWe intend for our country to become a model of\neffective partnership with other nations, and with this body,\ndemonstrating the application of new, clean technologies in\norder to accommodate sustainable development within a\nsmall, pristine environment.\nOf course, as a nation of remote and widely dispersed\nsmall islands, many of which are low-lying atolls, we\nexperience all the difficulties recognized in section G of\nchapter 17 of Agenda 21 as inhibiting the development of\nsmall island countries. Thus, we are thankful for the\nopportunity now before us to enhance general understanding\nof those difficulties through the Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island States.\nAs a member of the Alliance of Small Island States, we\nare participating fully in that process. It was most\nencouraging to note, at the recent preparatory conference, the\nstrong participation by developed countries and also the solid\nsupport from our colleagues in the Group of 77. We shall\nfully reciprocate that support in all appropriate settings\nbecause, despite our awareness of our own problems, we\nknow that virtually all developing countries exhibit one or\nmore disabling characteristics that distinguish them from the\nothers. While we are part of a relatively large grouping of\ncountries that share similar characteristics and disabilities, all\ndeveloping countries deserve to have attention paid to their\nparticular obstacles to development.\nIn that light, we perceive the Barbados Conference next\nyear as an important early milestone in the post-Rio process,\nnot only for small island developing States but for all\nnations, developed and developing, that believe as we do in\nthe Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21. The Barbados\nConference is, in our view, the first real test of Agenda 21.\nIt may seem at times that we of the region of the\nPacific islands are overly-preoccupied about our\nenvironment, and that we take too broad a view of the\npotential impact resulting from the actions of others. We\nraise our voices loudly and often on the subject of\nForty-eighth session - 13 October l993 5\nhuman-induced climate change and sea-level rise, but many\nsay that it may not happen. We speak out against nuclear\ntesting, especially in and among our islands, but those who\nare more powerful say that it probably is not harmful. We\nstrongly urge that lethal toxic substances such as plutonium\nand chemical weapons not be transported through or stored\nwithin our region, but even some of our closest friends do so\nregardless, insisting that in all likelihood there is no danger.\nAre we too concerned? Are we naive? I believe that we are\nnot, because the Pacific region appears to be a vast, thinly\npopulated ocean area and thus a prime location for the dirty\nbusiness of others - but that region is our home and our\nresponsibility.\nNot only must we provide for ourselves from its\nbounty, but we are also stewards of what is coming to be\nrecognized in scientific circles as the last remaining great\nunspoiled natural resource of the planet. Our fisheries are\nplentiful, but they could be threatened if experiences\nelsewhere in the world are repeated. Our air is still clean,\nbut we now know we are vulnerable to occurrences\nelsewhere. Our water is still pure, but we have seen other\nseas contaminated by unsustainable practices. We must, and\nwill continue to, speak out.\nOur region is not simply the victim of the callous\ndisregard of the powerful for the consequences visited upon\nthe poor or the weak. Rather, we recognize that for\ncenturies mankind has regarded the vast oceans as free\nspace, open to all passage and exploitation. Although\nexclusive economic zones and multilateral treaties have had\nmajor impact, the fact remains that the Pacific Ocean is\ntoday the world\u2019s ultimate \\\"back yard\\\".\nMy country\u2019s plea, then, is quite simple and\nstraightforward. We call on all members of the world\ncommunity to join us, in the spirit of Rio, in a true\npartnership for the sustainable development, not just of one\nor more Pacific island countries, but of our ocean and all\nthat is in it. One important focus must, of course, be upon\nthe land and coastal areas within our region, in order to\naccommodate appropriate development without degrading\neither the land or its surrounding marine space. But another,\nbroader, focus must be on the ocean itself - to respect and\nbuild upon the growing scientific knowledge of its complex\necological systems.\nIt is well known that the Federated States of\nMicronesia, along with other low-lying island countries of\nthe World, is literally frightened that its scarce land space\nmay be made uninhabitable and ultimately disappear if even\nthe moderate predictions of global warming and sea-level\nrise come to pass. But if this were the only concern with\nregard to human-induced climate change, loss of biodiversity\nand unsustainable development, we would be hard put to call\nupon the world at large to make fundamental changes in the\nway it lives. Ours, however, is by no means an isolated\nconcern. As the South Pacific Forum Heads of Government\nhave stressed for some years, the fate of the islands is an\nadvance warning of things to come, as we have predicted.\nThanks to the trends that I discussed earlier in respect\nof the modern realignment of motivations for international\ncooperation, I have tremendous confidence that we, and our\nchildren and their children, will succeed not only in\npreserving the environment but also in maintaining the pace\ntowards the ultimate goals of peace, enjoyment of human\nrights and social enrichment, as enshrined in the Charter.\nMy country pledges its efforts within this great Organization,\nduring this forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and\nafterwards, towards the attainment of these ends.\n"

        "file_text": "I am experiencing a feeling of signal honour and\ngenuine pleasure, and also at the same time a deep feeling\nas I now, on behalf of my country, Rwanda, speak before\nthis prestigious General Assembly of the United Nations,\nwhich each year considers the fate of our world.\nAbove all, I should like to associate myself with the\neminent speakers who have spoken before me here, to\nextend to you, Sir, on behalf of the delegation of which I am\nthe head, our warmest congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. We are assured that your personal\nqualities and your extensive experience in international\nissues will assist you in discharging this difficult\nresponsibility. Your personal qualities and your experience\nare the best guarantee of the success of the work of the\npresent session. We also wish to congratulate all the other\nmembers of the General Committee, who, we are sure, will\nspare no effort in assisting you in successfully discharging\nthe difficult task entrusted to you. The delegation of the\nRepublic of Rwanda will spare no effort to participate\nactively and effectively to ensure a successful conclusion of\nthe debate on the items on the agenda of this session.\n\nMoreover, we wish to render a well-deserved tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who was always\ninspired by the same concern for effectiveness in the cause\nof peace, justice and international security. He deserves our\ndeep gratitude for having guided with wisdom and\ncompetence the work of the forty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe should also like to take advantage of this happy\nopportunity to warmly welcome the presence here with us of\nnew Member States, the admission of which is an important\nstage towards achieving the universality of the Organization.\nThe forty-eighth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly is opening at a time when the world presents to us\na rather gloomy picture. Here and there are several scattered\nislets of peace and prosperity but they are few indeed.\nMoreover, in various corners of the world armed conflicts\nand political tensions are ready to explode into open crisis\nand economic and social ruin. In many countries we find\npoverty and upheavals in the quest for more balanced\nsocieties, and everywhere there is anguish in the face of so\nmany challenges which confront the conscience of man and\nwhich spawn fear for the future.\nFortunately, good will is being demonstrated and\nmobilized at the level of States, non-governmental\norganizations, and regional and international organizations -\nin the forefront of which is the United Nations - to arouse\nthe universal conscience, extinguish the fires, accompany\npolitical change, allay misery and renew hope and the\nenjoyment of life for those for whom the horizon seems\nclosed and gloomy.\nIt is an appropriate time and place to pay a sincere\ntribute to the world Organization and to its tireless\nSecretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for all the\nactions undertaken and carried out with skill and designed to\nrestore peace in regions and countries devastated by war, to\nprevent other conflicts, and to assist disadvantaged peoples\nor those sorely tried by disasters of all types. To be sure,\nthe means are limited, but is not this Organization the last\nhope of people?\nAnd success nurtures that hope. Thus we welcome\nenthusiastically the end of the civil war in Cambodia and the\nre-establishment of State institutions in that country.\nRwanda welcomes the progress that has been made\ntowards a settlement of the conflict in Mozambique and is\nfollowing particularly closely the political developments in\nSouth Africa. While the system of apartheid in the latter has\nnot yet been completely eliminated, recent developments\npromise positive and rapid progress.\nRwanda is also most gratified at the very positive\ncourse of the Middle East peace negotiations, which, thanks\nto mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and to the signing, in\nWashington on 13 September 1993, of an agreement on\nPalestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, have just gone\nthrough a very important stage. We hope that this historic\nagreement, which lays the bases for reconciliation between\nIsraelis and Palestinians, will open the way to a lasting\nsolution to all the issues connected with the problem of the\nMiddle East and will lead ultimately to peace and calm in\nthat part of the world.\nTo that end, we call on the international community to\nredouble its efforts to secure positive results for the attempts\nnow being made to settle the conflicts in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, Liberia, Angola, Somalia and all other\ncountries where peoples are being battered, divided and\nplunged into misery by individual or tribal egoism and\nambition or are having their sovereignty threatened by the\ninordinate greed of other States.\nAt the level of international economic relations, it is\ndepressing to note that, to this day, three quarters of\nmankind live on the sidelines of economic and social\nprogress, in so far as numerous structural imbalances\ncontinue to hamper the efforts of the countries of the South\nto achieve self-development and international cooperation.\nIndeed, despite the concerted efforts at integration, despite\nthe internal adjustments still undertaken at enormous\nsacrifice, and despite the expressions of good will for\ninternational partnership, foreign debt continues to grow, and\nthe gap between the economies of the North and those of the\nSouth continues to widen.\nThe delegation of Rwanda is convinced that if the lot\nof mankind is to be improved, the international community\nmust undertake measures that can promote the emergence of\na new, more balanced and more equitable world economic\norder. In this regard, only a common political will on the\npart of all the Members of this Organization can help to\ncorrect the structural imbalances in the global economy and\nto open the way to a new partnership in which\ninterdependence means, first and foremost, a shared destiny\nfor mankind, in which international cooperation is even more\nsynonymous with success that benefits all the partners - the\nseal of fraternity and the promise of genuine solidarity.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 3\nRwanda has always believed that international\ncooperation, if it is to be more effective, must be based to an\neven greater extent on intense, transparent, consistent and\nconcise action agreed with our partners and undertaken\nwithin what must one day be regarded as a genuine contract\nof solidarity. Rwanda has always believed that well-planned\ncooperation implies the concept of co-management, of co-\nresponsibility. This means shared responsibility, ongoing\ndialogue, transparency of commitments and acceptance of\nthe right of all sides to make mistakes, so that, to a greater\nextent than in the past, cooperation can meet the stakes of\nthe future. To secure even more genuine cooperation, the\ninternational community must seek effective solutions to all\nthese challenges that are leading us into institutionalized,\ncrushing debt.\nIn addition, the scope of international cooperation can\nbe widened, and its impact increased, only through genuine\nintegration of action and of programmes in the context of a\nnational strategy and with a global vision of authentic self-\ndevelopment. Rwanda has always attached special\nimportance to international cooperation, to which it owes so\nmuch of its progress, its development and its achievements.\nWith regard to the political situation in Rwanda, my\ncountry, as Members know, is emerging from a pointless and\nundeserved war, which was imposed on it three years ago,\non 1 October 1990. Allow me, before sketching out the\nsituation into which this war has plunged the population of\nRwanda and the country\u2019s economy, to emphasize once\nagain the role of the international community in resolving\ncrises and conflicts, for the ending of the war in my country\nis the result of a miracle of international solidarity.\nThere is no doubt that this required the good will of the\ntwo parties to the conflict. Wisdom prevailed over ambition,\nand hatred yielded to the nation\u2019s need to survive. But the\nwill of the two parties to pool their efforts was strongly\nsupported by countries neighbouring Rwanda, among which\nthe two parties chose, by common agreement, the Republic\nof Zaire as Mediator and the United Republic of Tanzania as\nFacilitator.\nThe two warring parties benefited also from the skilled\nhelp of President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, who was at that\ntime Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, and of\ncertain friendly countries - France, Belgium, the Federal\nRepublic of Germany and the United States of America. In\naddition, they received most valuable assistance from the\nOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations. All\nthese countries and international organizations sent\nrepresentatives to Arusha, Tanzania, to take part in the peace\nnegotiations that had begun in Zaire following the launching\nof hostilities, that had continued in Tanzania for a year, with\ntheir participation, and that culminated in a peace agreement.\nI take this opportunity to express once again to all these\ncountries and organizations the sincere gratitude of the\nGovernment and people of Rwanda for their highly valuable\ncontribution to the positive outcome of the negotiations,\nwhich were very trying to all who were involved and which\non numerous occasions would have been on the verge of\ncollapse had it not been for the tenacity and determination\nof the two parties and the wise and firm advice of all friends\npresent.\nThis senseless war that befell Rwanda is now subsiding,\nthanks to the peace agreement that was signed in Arusha on\n4 August 1993. It was bloody and devastating. We mourn\ntens of thousands of victims. The war resulted in\nconsiderable destruction of infrastructure, equipment and\nsocio-economic and administrative systems, and it left in a\nstate of dire poverty more than 900,000 displaced persons,\nwhose property went up in smoke.\nThat war has left us with orphans and invalids of all\nages, widows, helpless old people and hundreds of thousands\nof economic victims. In the regions affected by the war,\nmisery and desolation hold sway. Education has been\nseverely jeopardized and the psychological consequences for\nthe most vulnerable age groups are doubtless incalculable.\nThis war has destroyed the fragile equilibrium of the\ncountry\u2019s food supply and has exacerbated the famine which\nhas struck the entire country, because it broke out in the\ncountry\u2019s most fertile regions, which have not been\ncultivated for three years now. The representatives of\ninternational bodies and non-governmental organizations who\nvisited the camps of displaced persons cannot forget the\ndesolate sight of the make-shift shelters where hundreds of\nthousands of human beings, crammed together in highly\nunsanitary conditions, continue to lead lives that are close to\nintolerable. Those representatives cannot forget the long\nlines of hungry people on the roads, seeking the assistance\nsent them by the international community, which with\ndifficulty was able to deliver it to them for their survival.\nAnd what can we say of the economy in general?\nAlready badly shaken, it is today in even worse condition,\nfollowing the enormous expenditures resulting from the war\nand the destruction it caused. Thus, after the signing of the\nArusha Peace Agreement, the time has come for the long-\nterm, enormous work of national reconstruction in the newly\nregained peace and calm, without forgetting the other, no\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nless important objective, the implementation of national\nreconciliation and the continued strengthening of the process\nof democratization in the management of the country. We\ncan already welcome the establishment of a multi-party\nsystem by the constitutional review of 10 June 1991, thanks\nto which 17 political parties were agreed upon. Five of\nthem are at present forming a transition Government which\nsoon will be expanded to the Rwanda Patriotic Front for a\nnew transitional period which should lead to pluralist, free\nand democratic elections.\nOn the economic level, Rwanda has been experiencing\na crisis since the 1980s, which has had negative\nrepercussions on the implementation of the budget and has\nbeen exacerbated not only by the war but also by the\nunpredictable nature of external shocks, in particular the\ncollapse of the international price of coffee, our primary\nexport.\nAs it was no longer possible to control the growth of\npublic expenditures and of the fundamental imbalance in the\nbalance of trade, in combination with a production system\nwhose structure is very fragile, my country implemented, in\nNovember 1990, a programme of recovery having the\nfollowing priorities: to relaunch the economy, to achieve\ninternal and external financial balance, to promote domestic\nsavings, to encourage the activity of the private sector and\nto improve the management of the public sector.\nRwanda\u2019s structural adjustment programme has been\ngiven great technical and financial support by all the donors,\nheaded by the Bretton Woods institutions. Unfortunately,\nthe launching of this programme, which the Government\ncould apparently have carried out without too many sudden\ndetours, coincided with the attack of October 1990.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like most solemnly to thank\nthe international community for the support it has accorded\nRwanda both with assistance in the balance of payments and\nwith development projects. We are even more grateful for\nthe priority the international community has given to\nassistance for those displaced by the war, in answer to the\nconsolidated appeal made by the Department of\nHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, whose\ndedication is inestimable.\nFollowing the war and the new deterioration of the\nterms of trade which affected the economy of Rwanda, the\nvery backbone of our structural adjustment programme is\nthreatened. I am speaking here of the liberalization of\nexternal and internal trade which requires a comfortable\ncurrency reserve situation.\nThe Government of Rwanda has just decided upon the\nprimary features of its short- and medium-term post-war\neconomic policy from 1993 to 1996, items we have\nsubmitted to the international community. This policy\nreflects the Government\u2019s commitment to do all in its power\nto stabilize the large financial balances and to launch the\nprocess of economic recovery on the basis of the\nfundamental strategy of the structural adjustment programme,\nwhich gives a key role to market forces. In short, the\npositive results of the measures that have been in place since\nNovember 1990 must be capitalized upon, and new measures\nrequired by the deterioration of short- and medium-term\neconomic prospects, linked to the war, must be planned.\nTherefore, in accordance with the contents of the Peace\nAgreement, the priorities of the expanded transitional\nGovernment are to pursue efforts at economic recovery and\nto work on four programmes for specifically post-war\neconomic development: emergency assistance to those\ndisplaced by the war in order to help them return to their\nproperty, assistance in the reintegration of Rwandese\nrefugees, assistance in reconstruction and assistance in the\nsocial and economic reintegration of demobilized military\npersonnel.\nFor the repatriation of Rwandese refugees in accordance\nwith the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991, a\ndonors\u2019 meeting will be organized at the initiative of the\nGovernment, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR). With the war, we saw all types of\ndestruction, particularly the damaging and/or destruction of\nseveral thousands of hectares of forest which will even\nfurther aggravate the wood shortage. With the end of the\nwar, the country will have to dispose of the funds to\ndemobilize more than 31,000 military personnel. We will\nalso have to locate throughout the country paying jobs and\ntraining which can facilitate their social and economic\nreintegration.\nWithin the framework of the preparation for the\nprogrammes of reconstruction and socio-economic\nreintegration of demobilized military personnel, I have\npersonally sent a request to the Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations, on 2 January 1993, and an inter-agency\nmission of the United Nations systems and of the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) is at present\nbacking the Government of Rwanda in the preparation of the\ndocument to be submitted to the donors at a round table for\nhumanitarian emergency assistance.\nForty-eighth session - 6 October l993 5\nRwanda is trying to manage its meagre resources in an\nextremely difficult context. But it remains committed to the\nstrategy of economic development contained in the structural\nadjustment programme it launched in November 1990, with,\nas its base, the process of economic liberalization that has\nalready begun and is giving the private sector a larger role\nin decision-making.\nBy signing the Peace Agreement the Government of\nRwanda firmly committed itself to strengthening the basis of\na State of law in which public freedoms, together with\npolitical rights, justice and equality, will be guaranteed. In\nthat Agreement the two parties have agreed that an\nindependent National Commission for Human Rights will be\nestablished entrusted with dealing with violations of human\nrights perpetrated by any person on Rwandan territory and,\nin particular, by State bodies and by persons under cover of\nthe State or other organizations. Simultaneously, the\nGovernment will move to improve the functioning of the\nlegal and penal systems, in particular by forbidding arbitrary\nand illegal arrests and inhumane treatment of detainees and\nby severely punishing the perpetrators of such acts.\nSince the country\u2019s human, material and financial\nmeans are severely limited, an appeal will be made to\nforeign financial and technological assistance, especially in\nthe area of the training of magistrates and officials of the\nOffice of the Public Prosecutor and Ministry of Justice\npersonnel.\nIn the Peace Agreement the Government of Rwanda has\nalso reaffirmed its determination to reach a final settlement\nof the refugee problem, a goal to which it had committed\nitself in the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration of 19 February 1991\nat the regional summit meeting which examined the problem\nof Rwandan refugees.\nThe task will be a difficult one for the broad-based\ntransitional government envisaged in the agreement within\nthe framework of the Protocols of Agreement on Power-\nsharing between the country\u2019s political parties and the\nRwandese Patriotic Front (RPF). That Government will be\nset up in the next few days, as soon as the prerequisite\nconditions have been met. The task will also be a difficult\none for the people of Rwanda as a whole, who will be the\nultimate authors and beneficiaries of the hoped-for progress\nand well-being.\nNevertheless, despite the will and determination of the\nRwandan people and their Government, we must\nacknowledge the utter insufficiency of the domestic means\navailable, given the titanic labour to be accomplished. We\nthus look to the international community to support and\nsupplement our own efforts.\nThe first contribution we expect from the international\ncommunity is the deployment, as rapidly as possible, of an\ninternational neutral force, as provided in the Arusha\nAgreement. On behalf of the people of Rwanda, I should\nlike to express to the United Nations as a whole, and to the\nmembers of the Security Council in particular, our gratitude\nfor the historic decision the Organization took yesterday in\nadopting the resolution establishing the United Nations\nAssistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), so long awaited\nfor the implementation of the Arusha Peace Agreement.\nThe Agreement assigns to that force the task of\nfacilitating the implementation of the Peace Agreement,\nspecifically by supervising implementation of the Protocol on\nthe Integration of the Armed Forces of the Two Parties and\nby providing various kinds of assistance to the authorities\nand competent bodies. The Agreement also assigns to\nUNAMIR security tasks, including, inter alia, monitoring the\noverall security situation in the country and investigating and\nreporting on activities carried out by the competent\nauthorities and bodies in the maintenance of public order;\nassisting in ensuring the security of the civilian population;\nassisting with mine-clearance operations; assisting in the\nidentification of arms stockpiles and the neutralization of\narmed bands throughout the country, and monitoring the\nrespect by both sides of the comprehensive cease-fire and\ncessation of hostilities, as provided in the Peace Agreement.\nLastly, the Arusha Peace Agreement entrusts the neutral\ninternational force with the tasks of supervising the training\nprocess of the national armed forces, and here I would\nmention only the supervision of the disengagement of forces,\nsupervision of the demobilization of all the military forces\nand the Gendarmerie, and participation in the training\nprogramme for members of the New National Army and\nNational Gendarmerie.\nThis is some indication of how necessary and urgent\nthe establishment of the neutral international force is in order\nto allow for the creation of the broad-based transitional\ngovernment and the reintegration of persons displaced by the\nwar, the repatriation of refugees and, in a\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ngeneral manner, national reconstruction in conditions of\nmaximum security.\nAnother extremely vital contribution we expect from the\ninternational community, and more specifically from the\nUnited Nations system and, on a bilateral level, from the\nfriendly countries and various non-governmental\norganizations, will be that of financing the priority\nprogrammes to which I referred a few moments ago.\nToday, more than ever, Rwanda needs the attention,\nconcern and good will of the international community. It is\nrelying on that community\u2019s generosity to re-establish itself\nand to recover from the horrors of war. May that hope be\nrealized soon.\nWith the support of the international community the\npeople of Rwanda hope to pass smoothly through a transition\nperiod that, notwithstanding the guidelines of the Peace\nAgreement, could still turn out to be arduous. The people\nof Rwanda, however, are relying on the patriotism and sense\nof responsibility that their political authorities and the leaders\nof the parties in the government and the Transitional\nAssembly must demonstrate to consolidate the democratic\ngains and lay down, once and for all, the foundations of\npeace and national harmony. Once the demons of division\nhave been exorcised, the people of Rwanda will surely build\na new nation and experience once again uninterrupted\nprogress.\nAt this session of the General Assembly elections will\nbe held for a number of seats on the Security Council.\nRwanda has officially put forward its candidacy to become\na non-permanent member of that body entrusted with\nresponsibility for international peace and security. Its\ncandidacy was endorsed at the last Summit Meeting of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) held at Cairo at the\nend of June this year. As the Head of State, I ask for the\nAssembly\u2019s trust in my country, Rwanda, which has never\nyet had a seat on the Security Council. As a State\nconcerned to carry out its responsibilities, including those on\nthe international level, Rwanda believes that it can, today\nmore than yesterday, make its modest contribution to the\nmaintenance of peace in the world and to the restoration of\npeace in troubled regions and countries.\nEmerging as it now is from a war that has tried it\nsorely, Rwanda is better aware of the price of peace, the\npeace it has now regained thanks in particular to the efforts\nof the international community.\nThose are the reasons that have motivated Rwanda to\nput forward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council: to assist other warring nations to return to\npeace, but also to work, together with the other members of\nthe Council, for the strengthening of peace within its own\nborders. Rwanda hopes that it will have your confidence.\nAn ancient country that was under United Nations\ntrusteeship throughout the period prior to its accession to\nnational independence, my country, Rwanda, which has just\nemerged from the throes of an unmentionable war and now\nyearns to rebuild, relying on the lessons of the past, has\nevery reason to feel that it has matured, and it assures you\nof its unswerving determination to work for the advent of\npeace in the world and understanding among nations. On its\nbehalf, I repeat to the United Nations, our Organization, our\nsincerest wishes that it may succeed and flourish for the\nhappiness of all mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like first of all to extend\nmy heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President, who also\nserve as Guyana\u2019s Ambassador to Japan, on your election\nlast week to the presidency of this session of the General\nAssembly. Let me also express my deep appreciation to the\nprevious President, Mr. Ganev, for his achievements during\nthe past year, particularly in pursuing General Assembly\nreforms.\nI want to take this opportunity to commend\nSecretary-General Boutros-Ghali for his selfless devotion to\nthe cause of global peace and for his bold efforts towards\nUnited Nations reform.\nFinally, I warmly welcome the representatives of the six\nnew Member States that have joined the United Nations over\nthe past year.\nIn Japan, the reins of government recently changed\nhands for the first time in 38 years. The coalition\ngovernment that emerged has appointed me Prime Minister.\nPolitical changes in Japan are part of the dramatic changes\nin the international community since the end of the\nEast-West confrontation. The post-cold-war era has opened,\nnot just a new page, but a whole new chapter in Japanese\npolitics. This means an era of basic reform in three main\nareas, namely, political, economic and administrative\nreforms. I believe these reforms are vital in strengthening\nJapan\u2019s bonds with the international community.\nAs I devote my attention and energy to these domestic\nreforms I have come to the United Nations General\nAssembly on my first official visit abroad. I have done so\nbecause Japan believes that the United Nations has a crucial\nrole to play in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. I also wished personally to convey Japan\u2019s\ndetermination to contribute, both financially and in terms of\npersonnel, to various United Nations efforts.\nFurther, I wish to state again that Japan continues to\nfeel a sense of remorse over its past actions and that it is\nfirmly resolved to make further contributions to the goals of\nworld peace and prosperity.\nAs for the current situation in Russia, Japan continues\nto support President Yeltsin in his reform efforts. Japan\nstrongly hopes that a political environment which reflects the\nwill of the Russian people will soon be created and that the\nreforms will be further promoted.\nToday, the primary objective of the United Nations and\nits Member States is to establish world peace on the basis of\nthe universal principles of freedom, democracy and respect\nfor human rights.\nThere are four areas in which the international\ncommunity must direct its greatest efforts in pursuit of this\nobjective.\nI shall begin with the issue of disarmament. The Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the\ncentre-piece of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear\nweapons. I wish to affirm that Japan supports the indefinite\nextension of that Treaty beyond 1995. It is critically\nimportant that countries which have not yet acceded to the\nTreaty do so to enhance its universality. At the same time,\nthe indefinite extension of the NPT should not mean the\nperpetuation of the possession of nuclear weapons by the\nnuclear-weapon States.\nJapan thus welcomes the progress made towards nuclear\ndisarmament by the United States and Russia and\nemphasizes that all nuclear-weapon States must work in\nearnest to achieve further progress in nuclear disarmament.\nWe hail the decision to commence substantive negotiations\naimed at a comprehensive nuclear test-ban. For its part,\nJapan will work actively to help reduce world stockpiles of\nnuclear weapons. For example, we are ready to assist in the\ndismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union.\nWe also strongly urge North Korea to dispel international\nconcern about its development of nuclear weapons by, for\nexample, fully implementing the safeguards agreement with\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nOn the transfer of conventional arms, the effective\nimplementation of the United Nations Register of\nConventional Arms is essential. I strongly urge all nations\nto participate in this endeavour. In extending its official\ndevelopment assistance, Japan continues to pay full attention\nto such trends as military expenditures in recipient nations.\nThe second point I wish to make is the importance of\ndiplomatic efforts in the prevention of conflicts. The value\nof regional security arrangements and bilateral or multilateral\npolitical and security dialogue is undeniable in preventing or\nsettling armed conflicts.\nIn this connection, I was deeply moved by and heartily\nwelcome the historic signing of the declaration of principles\nfor Palestinian interim self-government by the Israelis and\nthe Palestinians. I pay a sincere tribute to their political\nleaders for taking this courageous step. It is essential that\nthe international community support this agreement actively\nand promptly in order to realize peace in the region. Japan\nwill continue to play a constructive role in the multilateral\nnegotiations that are part of the peace process. I am pleased\non this occasion to announce Japan\u2019s intention to extend\nabout $200 million in assistance to the Palestinians over the\ncoming two years. This assistance will include grant aid for\nfood and medicine and concessional loans for infrastructure.\nHumanitarian considerations, particularly respect for\nhuman rights, are inseparable from the issue of peace.\nWhere there is war, human rights are often neglected.\nConversely, in countries where respect for human rights has\nbeen firmly established, hostilities are less likely to break\nout. Japan must actively contribute to the solution of\nhumanitarian problems. I would like to see my fellow\ncountrymen and women roll up their sleeves and work side\nby side with people from many other countries, whenever\nand wherever humanitarian activities are called for.\nThe third area of focus is economic development as a\nfoundation for peace-building. Today, the market economy\nhas become a common language in most nations of the\nworld, including many of the former socialist States. The\ndevelopment of the global economy based on principles of\nmarket economy should be urgently promoted. Japan and\nother industrialized nations must provide support to\ndeveloping countries in their development efforts, as well as\nto former socialist countries in their political and economic\nreform efforts. It goes without saying that assistance to\ncountries in transition must not come at the expense of aid\nto developing countries.\nAlready the world\u2019s top donor of official development\nassistance in absolute terms, Japan recently established its\nFifth Medium-Term Target to further expand such\nassistance. Japan intends to provide official development\nassistance totalling between $70 billion and $75 billion over\nthe five-year period beginning in 1993. As part of its aid\nefforts, two weeks ago Japan hosted, in Tokyo, the Third\nMongolia Assistance Group Meeting. Next week, in\ncooperation with the United Nations, we will hold the\nInternational Conference on African Development in Tokyo.\nThe fourth item I would like to address concerns global\nissues such as the environment and population. The urgent\nneed to solve the problems of the global environment cannot\nbe overemphasized. Japan is willing to assume a leading\nrole in international efforts to tackle environmental problems.\nIn so doing, we will draw upon the experience and\nknow-how we have gained in overcoming serious pollution\nproblems at home. Not only is Japan developing new\ntechnologies for environmental protection, it is taking the\nlead in transferring such technologies to developing countries\nthrough the International Environmental Technology Centre\nof the United Nations Environment Programme, which was\nset up in Japan last year. At the 1992 United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, Japan\npledged approximately $7 billion to $7.7 billion in\nenvironment-related official development assistance over the\nfive years beginning 1992. In fact, Japan has already\nimplemented more than one fourth of that amount.\nPopulation problems often lead to poverty and famine.\nSolving these problems is therefore crucial to the goal of\nsustainable development and will require a broad-based\napproach including education and public information efforts.\nWith these thoughts in mind, Japan will sponsor a meeting\nof eminent persons on population and development next\nJanuary, prior to the International Conference on Population\nand Development to be held in Cairo next year.\nThe year 1995 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations. Since the birth of this\nOrganization immediately following the Second World War,\nthe international climate has changed dramatically. In the\nmeantime, United Nations membership has grown from 51\nStates in 1945 to the present 184. Today, the international\ncommunity is placing ever- higher expectations on the\nUnited Nations. But serious reform efforts are necessary if\nthe United Nations is to respond to these expectations and\nmeet the new demands awaiting us at the threshold of the\nnext century.\nI would like to comment on three specific areas in\nwhich reforms are necessary - namely, peace-keeping, the\nstructure of the Security Council, and United Nations\nadministration and finance.\nLast year, Japan enacted the International Peace\nCooperation Law enabling it to contribute personnel to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations. Since then, it has\ndispatched Japanese personnel to Angola, Cambodia and\nMozambique. Japan intends to continue to promote such\ncooperation in the future.\nAmong recent United Nations peace-keeping operations,\nthe United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia\n(UNTAC) stands out as a major achievement. I would like\nto take this opportunity to express my deep respect for the\nefforts of UNTAC personnel and all the countries concerned.\nThe success of the operation in Cambodia owes much to the\ncomprehensive framework for peace that was put in place\nand the support it received from the international\ncommunity. I am convinced that its experience in Cambodia\nwill provide the United Nations with useful insights for its\nfuture activities.\nEnsuring the security of the personnel engaged in\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations is a task of high\npriority to the international community, and I hope this issue\nwill be the subject of thorough debate at the current session\nof the General Assembly. Other issues demanding our\nattention are the need to determine a so-called \\\"sunset\\\" for\neach peace-keeping operation to evaluate each operation\nproperly and to review strictly the activities of an existing\noperation in deciding whether to extend its mandate. Japan\nalso strongly hopes that the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund,\nwhich was established last year, will be fully funded and\nused effectively.\nThe sharp increase in the number of regional conflicts\nhas meant a dramatic expansion of the role of the Security\nCouncil. Accordingly, it is necessary that the functions of\nthe Council, which has the primary responsibility for\nmaintaining international peace and security, be strengthened.\nIt is important that those countries having both the will and\nthe adequate capacity to contribute to world prosperity and\nstability be actively engaged in that effort. The views\nexpressed by many Member States, including our own, in\nresponse to a General Assembly resolution on this subject\nlast year, generally indicate the need to expand the\nmembership of the Security Council, while ensuring that its\neffectiveness is maintained. Japan intends to participate\nconstructively in the discussion on Security Council reform.\nToday the United Nations finds itself in extremely\nserious financial straits. In particular, the rapid expansion of\npeace-keeping operations has made it increasingly difficult\nfor this Organization to meet its financial needs promptly.\nWithout adequate financial resources, the United Nations\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 19\nwould be powerless to engage in any activity, no matter how\nmeaningful it may be. I would like to remind all United\nNations Member States how important it is that they face\nthis reality and fulfil their obligations.\nAt the same time, I note with concern the frequent\nallegations of inefficiency or wastefulness at the United\nNations. I hope the United Nations will make the utmost\nefforts to meet the need for greater financial discipline and\neffective budgetary control.\nJapan is prepared to do all it can to discharge its\nresponsibilities in a United Nations reformed with the\nprevious three points taken into account.\nWhen the forerunner of the United Nations, the League\nof Nations, was established in 1920, the renowned Japanese\neducator Mr. Inazo Nitobe was appointed as one of its\nDeputy Secretaries-General. Mr. Nitobe, who had sought to\nintroduce Japan\u2019s philosophical traditions to the world,\nremarked that the Japanese place great value on moral\nprinciples. I would like to conclude my address by offering\na quote from one of Mr. Nitobe\u2019s lectures which reflects my\nown view on the evolving bonds between Japan and the\ninternational community:\n\\\"An international mind is not the antonym of a\nnational mind ... The international mind is an\nexpansion of the national mind, just as\nphilanthropy or charity ... should begin at home.\\\"\n"

        "file_text": "As I stand today at this rostrum, a\nflood of memories rushes to my mind. I recall appearing as\nPremier before the United Nations Committee on\ndecolonization in 1961 to plead the case of my country\u2019s\nindependence. Like so many other colonies after the Second\nWorld War, Guyana was anxious to secure its freedom and\nexercise its right to self-determination.\nThe road, however, was far from easy. Along the way\nthere were many stumbling-blocks and casualties. It was not\nuntil 1966, long after most subject peoples had been set free,\nthat we became independent and took our place in the family\nof nations.\nThe world today is radically different from what it was\nthen. The total membership of the United Nations has\ngrown significantly. The cold war, which had bedevilled\ninternational relations since 1947, has ended, with a promise\nof a new and more democratic world order. With the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, one of the two super-Powers,\nthere are severe difficulties for the new structures which\nhave been established. Nevertheless, hope is alive for the\nconstruction of an era of peace, based on respect for all\npeoples and the promotion of their general welfare. It is an\nexciting moment in world history, and for the United\nNations there is a defining role.\nGuyana has been honoured by the unanimous election\nof its representative to the presidency of this forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly. This session will\nundoubtedly be a challenging one. I wish to thank the entire\nmembership for its vote of confidence in our ability to\nundertake this lofty responsibility. It is, after all, an\nacknowledgement that all States, irrespective of their size,\ncan play an important role in the Organization\u2019s work. I am\nespecially grateful to the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) group and the wider Latin American and\nCaribbean Group for their full endorsement of our\ncandidacy. I must also pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr.\nStoyan Ganev for his capable direction of the forty-seventh\nsession and to our distinguished Secretary-General for his\nefforts to promote the continuing success of our world\nOrganization.\nSuccess in these volatile times is often tempered. For,\nnotwithstanding its important accomplishments, the United\nNations cannot be said to have fulfilled the highest\naspirations of its creators. The scourge of war is still\nrampant in many places. Colonialism is certainly not extinct,\nand today it threatens to survive in different forms. Many\naspects of colonialism are evident in the ever-widening gap\n\nbetween the developed and the developing countries and the\ndependence of impoverished millions on the largesse of a\nfew. This prevailing economic and social disparity provides\na breeding ground for hunger, disease and poverty and\nultimately constitutes a threat to international peace and\nsecurity.\nAs the focal point of multilateralism, the United\nNations must continue to explore the full limits of\ninternational cooperation in order to eliminate, or at least\nalleviate, the problems of the disadvantaged. I should like\nto think that there is now agreement that the grave situation\nrequires collective action. Whatever its limitations, it is still\nthe best forum available to States for diplomacy, dialogue\nand negotiation, and thus for the avoidance of conflict. We\nshould seek, therefore, to enhance its ability to address our\ncommon goals.\nAs a small developing State, Guyana is fully committed\nto the ethos of multilateral cooperation which is embodied\nin the United Nations. We have come here to renew\npublicly our faith in the Organization and to urge all\nMembers to pledge to deepen and strengthen multilateralism\nas a foundation for inter-State relations. Experience has\nshown that no nation, however powerful, can exist in\nisolation. Its borders are not impervious to encroachment by\nuniversal ills. Ultimately, it must come together with the\nrest of the world to find common solutions to common\nproblems. AIDS, narcotic drugs, poverty and pollution are\nstriking examples of the pandemic which affects us all.\nControl of these scourges requires concerted action by the\nUnited Nations as a whole. Added to these are natural\ndisasters, such as the recent earthquake in India. Our\ndeepest sympathy goes out to the Indian people and\nGovernment.\nWe note with some disappointment that international\nconflicts continue to undermine the capacity of the\nOrganization to promote the cooperation which is deemed\nessential for reaching solutions to current global problems.\nThe real value of the United Nations in this period will\ndepend on its collective ability to respond effectively to this\nwave of international conflicts, and to find acceptable means\nof peace-keeping and peacemaking which will not be a\nburden on its membership.\nSuch a development will inspire confidence among\nmember nations to refer issues to the United Nations body,\nand to restore their reliance on the Organization\u2019s ability to\nresolve disputes before they resort to the battlefield.\nOur first effort at constructing a framework for\ninternational peace and security through the League of\nNations ended in failure. The reason can be found in the\ninherent weakness of the League, in the resultant inability to\ncontain rampant nationalism, particularism and insularity and\nin the lack of respect for its fundamental principles. The\nUnited Nations is a second experiment, prompted by the\ndisasters consequent upon the failure of the League. At San\nFrancisco we vowed to spare succeeding generations from\nthe scourge of war. We have before us today another\nopportunity to secure an era of real peace and stability, to\ndeploy fully the resources of the Organization in the service\nof humanity, and to reach for a broad-based, sustainable\ndevelopment and some measure of prosperity and fulfilment\nfor the peoples of this planet.\nIn our efforts to bolster international peace and security,\nthe report, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which was prepared by\nthe Secretary-General in response to the Security Council\u2019s\nrequest, sets out a number of proposals which merit serious\nconsideration. While recognizing the need to provide the\nCouncil with enforcement capacity under Chapter VII of the\nCharter, we place special importance on preventive\ndiplomacy, which would obviate recourse to physical\nintervention. As the experience of some recent peacemaking\nand peace-keeping operations has shown, these measures are\nfraught with uncertain political consequences. Moreover,\nthey have proved extremely costly, particularly to small\nStates such as ours which can ill afford such expenditures.\nSo diverse are the origins of conflict that each situation\nmust be examined in depth to determine the most\nappropriate means of peaceful solution. In some cases the\ndispute may have legal implications and may therefore be\nbest handled by a suitable judicial body. More often than\nnot, however, the roots of conflict are embedded in a history\nof complicated political, economic and social factors. In\nsuch instances the ground must be carefully prepared for the\ncultivation of peace and stability. Fortunately, the\nadvantages of the diplomatic approach are not lost in the\nUnited Nations, which increasingly is using the good offices\nof the Secretary-General and his representatives to induce\nsolutions to long-standing conflicts.\nWe believe that these examples reaffirm the virtue of\ndialogue and negotiation. However, although promising for\nthe future, other situations remain tenuous and require\nconstant monitoring. Somalia and Sudan must be carefully\nnurtured back to normalcy. In Europe, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina stands out as an horrific example of man\u2019s\ninhumanity to man, and compels us to search for a quick end\nto the wanton killing of innocent thousands. Indeed, the\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 3\nUnited Nations must hasten to devise new strategies to deal\nwith these persistent convulsions in the global body politic.\nThe Middle East has been embroiled in conflict for\nmuch too long. With the recent signing of the declaration of\nprinciples for Palestinian self-rule, the road ahead is\nencouraging. Peace and stability throughout the region now\nseem to be within our grasp. We hope also that the\nterritorial problems between Iraq and Kuwait can be\namicably settled.\nAs far as South Africa is concerned, the announcement\nof a date for elections, coupled with supporting structures,\ngives rise to the hope that majority rule is not far off and we\nmay in the near future welcome that country back into the\nfold of the international community. We urge the peoples of\nSouth Africa to eschew further violence and to come\ntogether for their common good.\nI wish to record with satisfaction the view that a return\nto democratic traditions and respect for good governance and\nhuman rights has helped to further promote peace. Guyana\nwill support any confidence-building mechanism which\nfavours dialogue over confrontation as the means of choice\nfor the pacific settlement of disputes. Because of the\ninherent correlation between peace and development it\nbehoves each member of the international community to\ncontinue the search, where needed, for creative ways to\nsettle disputes that could otherwise imperil not only\ninternational peace and security but also national\ndevelopment.\nIn this hemisphere, of which Guyana forms part, we are\nconcerned that, despite the end of the cold war, Cuba\nremains outside the inter-American family. We truly believe\nthat this is a serious anomaly in the context of the\nOrganization\u2019s efforts to build a new world order based on\nmutual understanding and respect among all States in a\nunited international community. We appeal to the United\nStates and Cuba to demonstrate their good will and seek\nurgently to reconcile their long-standing differences. The\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), which has a vested\ninterest in the early rapprochement between these two major\npartners, stands ready to play a role in this process.\nWe are particularly pleased that the Central American\nregion, which for far too long has been entrapped by\nanachronistic economic and social structures, has emerged\nfrom a vicious cycle of internecine violence. CARICOM\nwelcomes the opportunity which this development offers for\ncloser cooperation between two neighbouring regions. We\nare equally pleased that, after being held hostage by a\nmilitary dictatorship unwilling to heed the popular will, Haiti\nis once again free to pursue a democratic path. We offer to\nPresident Aristide and his government our ready cooperation\nin the urgent task of reconstruction for social progress.\nGuyana has itself only recently emerged from a difficult\nelectoral process that, under international vigilance, proved\nto be free and fair. We are particularly grateful for the role\nthe United Nations played in ensuring that the democratic\nwill of our people was fully respected. After all, the right\nto choose one\u2019s government is a fundamental human right,\nwhich should never be denied. We commend the United\nNations for providing electoral assistance at the request of\nthose who seek it, and with due respect for the principle of\nnational sovereignty. Elections alone, however, do not\nguarantee the preservation of democracy: they must be\naccompanied by the establishment of machinery that protects\nevery individual in our societies. I am pleased to report that\none of the first steps my Government took upon assuming\noffice was to accede to the Optional Protocol to the United\nNations Human Rights Covenants. We followed that with\nthe establishment of an Inter-Agency High-Level Committee\non Human Rights, whose function it is to ensure that Guyana\ncomplies with its reporting responsibilities under the Human\nRights Conventions.\nIt is not enough, however, to satisfy the civic and\npolitical rights of our citizens: their fundamental economic\nand social entitlements to food, clothing, shelter and so on\nmust also be provided. Human rights are indivisible, and to\nprefer one above the other is to deny their essential\ninterrelatedness. The Vienna Conference appears to have\nrecognized this fact and to have confirmed the need for a\nholistic approach. My own Government is dedicated to the\nproposition that human development must be comprehensive\nif our society\u2019s welfare is to be secured. Our stated policy,\ntherefore, is to create an environment in which democracy\nwill work to fulfil our people\u2019s spiritual and material needs.\nTo implement our development programme, however, we\nshall require the cooperation of the international community\nto supplement our own limited resources.\nAs I observed earlier this year at a Conference entitled\n\\\"Poverty in Guyana - Finding Solutions\\\", we are in a\nsituation of crisis. For, while we have recently begun to\nexperience high growth rates, the economy continues to be\nweak: unemployment is high; human and financial resources\nare scarce; and basic infrastructure has deteriorated, leaving\nthe social sectors vulnerable to all the ills of poverty. We\nhave been somewhat successful in raising production and\nproductivity levels, but are seriously limited by a heavy debt\nburden. Some 90 cents of each dollar earned now go\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ntowards the repayment of the national debt. And the\nproportion of our external commercial earnings for payment\nof our foreign debt is nearly three times the average of the\n47 least developed countries - an unbearably heavy burden.\nEven though we attempt to manage expenditure judiciously,\nthrough good governance - efficient management, a clean\nand lean administration and fullest respect for human rights -\nwe cannot perform miracles. At the end of the day, we must\nlook for assistance to buttress our domestic efforts and to\npreserve our tender democracy. With nearly 80 per cent of\nour people below the poverty line, we shall succeed in\nconsolidating democracy only through economic\ndevelopment with social justice.\nAt the present time, however, the prospects for such\nsupport appear rather bleak. There has been a noticeable\ncontraction in development aid as the economies of some\ndonor countries experience difficulties. Their own\nelectorates appear increasingly concerned with domestic\nproblems, such as unemployment and falling living\nstandards. Whatever limited resources are available are\nallocated by the developed nations largely on the basis of\nstrategic concerns. The international agenda is therefore\nbeing set more and more at the sacrifice of the developing\nworld. There is consequently an urgent need to reorder our\npriorities and to place development at the top of our agenda.\nAt best, however, development aid is no more than a\npalliative. Significant economic and social progress will\ncome to the developing countries only when inequitable and\nunjust economic and trade practices in the global system are\nremoved. As the 1992 human development report pointed\nout, we are denied some $500 billion in market opportunities\nannually, 10 times what we receive as foreign assistance,\nprimarily because of protectionist policies still being pursued\nby the developed countries. We call, therefore, on those\ncountries to open up their markets to our goods at prices that\ncompensate us fairly for our labour and production. In this\ncontext, we urge the industrial nations to expedite the\nconclusion of trade negotiations, taking fully into account the\ninterests of our small, developing economies. We would\nalso wish and ask that the formation of large regional\neconomic groupings - the megablocs as they are called -\nguard against the further marginalization of our economies\nand our countries.\nAdditionally, a definite solution must be found, during\nthe current decade, to the third world\u2019s crushing external\ndebt problem. In Latin America and the Caribbean, with\n181 million out of 441 million people living below the\npoverty line, in the mire of destitution, how can human\ndevelopment take place when, despite onerous debt\npayments, the stock of debt continues to grow? A\nprospective Economic Commission for Latin America and\nthe Caribbean (ECLAC) study for the region over the\n1985-1995 period shows a serious aggravation in terms of\npoverty, unemployment and foreign debt during the decade.\nBetween 1981 and 1990, the region\u2019s foreign debt payments\nwere $503 billion, of which $313 billion were interest\npayments. However, in the same period, the region\u2019s\nconsolidated foreign debt increased from $297 billion in\n1981 to $428 billion in 1991. Little wonder that the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) publication entitled\n\\\"Children of the Americas\\\" commented that this mechanism,\nwhereby the more you pay the more you owe, is perverse\nand must be stopped.\nDebt relief in the form of debt cancellation, grants, soft\nloans and rescheduling is urgent if the developing countries\nare to eradicate poverty, protect the environment and play a\nmeaningful role in expanding world trade and ending\nstagnation and recession in the industrially developed\ncountries. Debt relief must be seen as an investment not\nonly in the development of poor countries but also in the\nsecurity of the rich nations.\nRecognizing the link that exists between poverty, trade,\npopulation, development and the environment, we must\nhasten to implement the Rio programme of action outlined\nin Agenda 21. The developing countries urgently require the\nresources - both financial and technological - necessary to\nfulfil their obligations under that compact. As proof of its\ncommitment to protect the environment, Guyana has set\naside nearly 1 million acres of its tropical forests for\nresearch, management and development of our rich\nbiodiversity. With the welcome of entities such as the\nCommonwealth Secretariat, the United Nations Development\nProgramme and the Global Environment Facility, the\nIwokrama project, as it is now known, has been fully\nlaunched. At the commissioning ceremony held on World\nEnvironment Day this year, I dedicated the enterprise to our\nindigenous peoples, who are not only the principal\ninhabitants but also the custodians of our forests. It is\nfitting, especially in this, the International Year of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous People, that full recognition be given to\nthe important role they play in harmonizing man\u2019s\nrelationship with the Earth on which he lives.\nWe also urge full support for the Global Conference on\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates, scheduled to commence in Barbados in April 1994.\nWe trust that there will be adequate preparation and the\nwidest participation in that Conference.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 5\nIn a spirit of genuine cooperation, therefore, let us\nproceed to address the proposed agenda for development,\nwhich we have accepted as a natural concomitant to \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\". Indeed, peace cannot prevail in the\nabsence of development. Our attempts at peacemaking and\nconflict resolution in general will not succeed if inequitable\nand unjust economic and social conditions are allowed to\npersist. Of late, many of the organs and agencies engaged\nin the development process have had cause to lament the\ngrowing diminution of resources available to them, a\nproblem now aggravated by continuing diversion of funding\nto a multiplicity of peace-keeping operations. Obviously,\none recognizes the importance of maintaining global peace.\nHowever, it should not be at the cost of a disproportionate\nsacrifice of development, which leads to peace-keeping\nbecoming an end in itself instead of a means of encouraging\neconomic and social welfare.\nThe United Nations, whose universal membership\nencompasses both developed and developing nations,\nremains the ideal forum for forging a consensus on the\nmajor issues of peace and development. It is evident,\nhowever, that, as currently conceived and structured, it\ncannot adequately perform the role expected of it. That\nrealization has led us to undertake the exercise of reforming\nand restructuring the Organization. To this end, we must\nensure that the changes we make are not simply cosmetic\nbut serve effectively to enhance the Organization\u2019s capacity\nto deal with the challenges of the post-cold-war period. Our\nreforms must therefore seek to establish the United Nations\nas the principal forum in which macro-political, economic\nand social policies are collectively and consensually devised.\nIf truth be told, the United Nations is still largely\nperceived, notwithstanding its recent successes in the\npolitical field, as a \\\"talk shop\\\". Like the old Congress of\nVienna, which was described as a \\\"perpetual dance\\\", it is\nviewed in the eyes of our peoples - particularly the poor and\nthe suffering - as an endless round of dilatory debate which\nproduces fine resolutions but precious little by way of\nconcrete action. To survive and succeed, therefore, the\nUnited Nations must become relevant to the lives of men,\nwomen and children everywhere.\nUrgent action is required at this explosive period of\nmounting external debt, falling economic growth, falling\nthird-world commodity prices, increasing unemployment,\nenvironmental destruction, underdevelopment and the\npersistence of poverty. Our troubled planet calls for\nstatesmanship, political will and cooperation for meaningful\nchange. Market forces alone are not providing the people\nwith adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from\neconomic growth and development. We have a paradox of\ngrowing poverty in the midst of potential plenty. Science\nand technology have the capacity to eradicate poverty in the\nnot too distant future and to halve it by the end of the\ncentury. Instead, we have today, both in the developed and\nin the developing countries, only about half the growth rate\nof a decade ago and the catastrophic phenomenon of \\\"jobless\ngrowth\\\" - fewer and fewer jobs and more and more poverty\nand inequality.\nIt is necessary to ascertain the root causes of global\npoverty and to develop an integrated strategy for its\neradication. This necessitates a comprehensive world view\nand a recognition of the major contradiction of our time: the\ntremendous growth of the means of production and the\nanachronistic relations of production and the collective will\nto resolve this contradiction.\nIn the intense competition in a shrinking global\nmarket - owing in large part to the increasing poverty and\nthe widening gap between the rich and poor in both the\nNorth and South, and between the North and the South - the\nthree centres of the industrialized world - North America,\nWestern Europe and Japan - are resorting to even more\ncapital-intensive growth and the use of more and more\nsophisticated technology: computers and robots, cybernetics\nand automation. How can the poor and unsophisticated in\nthe third-world countries survive in the \\\"global village\\\", in\nthe \\\"borderless world\\\" when collectively these countries have\nnot attained the target projected long ago of 25 per cent in\nthe production of industrialized goods and with the great\nmajority light-years behind in human-resource development\nand burdened by the dead weight of unconscionable and\nimmoral debt payments? The rapid advance to robots and\nautomation in the North also poses a threat to the\nadvantageous position of competitive wage rates in many\ncountries of the South. And the industrialized countries with\nbudget deficits, growing numbers of jobless and retirees and\ninadequate welfare funds cannot afford the Keynesian luxury\nof pump-priming and \\\"workfare\\\".\nIn a situation of confusion and uncertainty, and with no\nsolution in sight, the reactionary ultra-rightists and\nneo-fascists are getting stronger politically and becoming\nmore vocal and strident. There is no answer to the\nhopelessness and despair of the more than 30 million\nunemployed in the countries of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development. Despair is leading\nto alcoholism, narcotics use, crime and suicide. Meanwhile\nnationalism, xenophobia and neo-fascism are on the rise,\nleading to racial and ethnic tensions and growing civil strife.\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe North-South dialogue has been languishing and has\nbecome a dialogue of the deaf. In the South, rising\nunemployment and abject poverty are interacting with rapid\npopulation growth, urbanization, overcrowding, disease, the\nproduction and use of narcotic drugs, increased flows of\nrefugees across international frontiers and irreversible\ndamage to the environment. Whereas it was said previously\nthat the Berlin Wall prevented peoples in the Soviet Union\nand Eastern Europe from travelling to the West, now new\nwalls are being erected to prevent people from entering the\ndeveloped, industrialized countries.\nIt is not enough to treat the symptoms of the global\nmalaise. Radical reforms are urgently needed. Structural\nadjustment is as necessary for the developed countries as for\nthe developing countries, but reforms must be predicated on\nsocial justice and have a human face. Human needs and\nhuman security should be the object of development. In this\nregard, greater emphasis must be placed on human capital\nand natural capital, and much more must be done to speed\nup disarmament so that the despairing and hungry of the\nworld can benefit from greatly enhanced savings.\nThe development agenda must include a critical analysis\nof possible options and must deal with the international\ncompetitiveness of the third world, the basis of new\nmodalities of international cooperation for development and\nthe financing of development. It must also address core\nproblems: alleviation of poverty, expansion of productive\nemployment and enhancement of social integration,\nparticularly of the more disadvantaged and marginal groups.\nTo attain these objectives, the people - I repeat, the\npeople - must play a central role. They must be fully\ninvolved in all aspects of life to take advantage of their\ninitiatives and creativity in the fashioning of a better future\nand a peaceful and prosperous world.\nAs the leader of a small nation which continues to\nbelieve in the vast potential of this Organization for making\nthe world a better place in which to live, I appeal to the\nAssembly to devote itself to this urgent task. Let us work\ntogether to advance the cause of global peace and\ndevelopment.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish sincerely to congratulate the representative\nof Guyana on his unanimous election to the distinguished\npost of President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. This is an expression of great respect for him and\nhis country. I cannot fail to note the enormous amount of\nhard and complicated work, deserving of the highest\nappreciation, that Mr. Stoyan Ganev, a representative of the\nfriendly, fraternal Bulgarian people, carried out in that post.\nWe welcome and congratulate the Czech Republic,\nSlovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\nMonaco, Andorra and Eritrea, which have this year become\nMembers of the United Nations.\nThe end of the twentieth century will undoubtedly go\ndown in history as a time of tectonic shifts in international\nrelations. With our own eyes we have seen the huge\ntectonic plate of the cold war, with its intense confrontation\nbetween two super-Powers and two ideologies, sink into the\npast. Living space for a new world order has been opened\nup. What will it look like?\nThe end of the last century was filled with dire\nforebodings reflected in a surrealistic quest, and those\nforebodings have, unfortunately, been borne out. The\ndifficult twentieth century has become the century of\nconfusion for the human soul and human society, and of the\nextreme tension of antagonisms that have many times\nbrought civilization to the brink of destruction.\nToday feelings and expectations are different. At the\nend of the century, it would seem, the foundation is being\nlaid for harmonizing new ways of life in the international\ncommunity.\nBut the establishment of a new world order is not as\npainless as one might imagine. Changes in the balance of\npower and the dynamism of international relations often\nmutate unforeseeably into chaotic scenes of tense\ncontradiction and conflict. World Powers, alliances of States\nand newly emerged countries are searching for their identity\nand rethinking their role in an entirely new world.\nNot always can an organizing vector or a system of\nvalues, guidelines and ideas inspiring all of us be felt in this\nworld.\nIn this situation, there is a new perception of the\npotential role of the United Nations. I believe that this\norganizing role of the United Nations is more lofty, more\nsignificant and more realistic than the one formerly assigned\nto it in the post-war decades, which in fact was unfeasible in\nthe context of confrontation between the super-Powers. It is\nprecisely this role for the United Nations in a new world that\nthe Republic of Belarus advocates most actively.\nIt is at this precise moment that the potential of both\nthe United Nations Charter and the Organization itself as a\ncentre for harmonizing and coordinating the action of nations\nis being realized. The United Nations, as the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has emphasized is truly\nbecoming irreplaceable.\nUndoubtedly, the new role of the United Nations\nrequires a new level of efficiency in the Organization,\nparticularly in its main bodies - the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly. The Republic of Belarus supports the\nreforms aimed at helping the Organization adapt to the\nfundamentally new realities and making the procedures of its\nmain bodies more democratic. But in surging forward, one\nshould not lose contact with the ground under one\u2019s feet.\nReforms, responsibilities and the future are those reference\npoints on which we believe we should constantly focus our\nattention.\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nAt this decisive moment, the Security Council is\nbecoming the centre of attention, like a magic crystal ball in\nwhich one can discern the future. Naturally, reforming the\nCouncil, including expanding its membership, requires an\nespecially responsible approach. Mindful that in these new\nconditions, this most important United Nations body cannot\nremain the same as it was designed and created almost half\na century ago, we support a careful search for consensus on\nall issues related to its reform. Changes in the Security\nCouncil - especially today, when its work has become much\nmore intensive - should not hamper the productiveness of its\nefforts. To a large extent these efforts depend, in our view,\non well-coordinated activities among all of the Council\u2019s 15\nmembers, on their adherence to the purposes and principles\nof the Charter of the Organization and on their highly\nconscientious, responsible attitude, proved, through real\ndeeds, to the entire international community.\nThe Republic of Belarus, as representatives know, is\none of the candidates for a non-permanent seat on the\nSecurity Council for 1994 to 1995. Today, on the eve of the\ngolden jubilee of the United Nations, the fiftieth anniversary\nof its creation, it is appropriate to recall that at the time of\nthe inception of the World Parliament back in 1945, Belarus\nwas a founding member of the United Nations, having been\namong the first to sign its Charter.\nIt is appropriate to recall here that we have gained a\ncertain amount of experience through working in the\nSecurity Council from 1974 to 1975. It is also true that we\nhave been represented in that important body the fewest\nnumber of times compared to our friends and colleagues in\nthe regional group, but we hope that this injustice will be\nredressed at the forthcoming elections.\nThe new historical conditions which led to the creation\nof the Commonwealth of Independent States, with Minsk as\nthe host city for its coordinating organs, have made us take\na fresh look at our role and at our possibilities of\nparticipating in the life of the international community. This\nis also attested to by the joint support of the Commonwealth\nand of a number of friendly States for Belarus\u2019s candidature\nfor non-permanent membership in the Security Council. For\nus, the submission of the candidature of the Republic of\nBelarus for membership in the Security Council does not\nrepresent merely a spontaneous political gesture nor a\nhankering for pro-forma prestige. Historical circumstances\nare such that the experience and the potential of Belarus, at\nthis very difficult moment in the formation of a new world\norder, can be of great importance to the international\ncommunity.\nLet us take a look at this experience and potential in\nthose areas which have become very important for\npreserving global peace and security, as is widely recognized\nand attested to even by this current debate.\nI deal first with the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. As representatives are aware, Belarus is one of\nthe four States that inherited strategic nuclear potential from\nthe former Soviet Union. In our case, this is an important\nmodern arsenal located in the heart of the European\ncontinent on mobile strategic missiles. It directly affects\nglobal security, the nuclear balance and nuclear non-\nproliferation. Belarus, however, renounces the prestige of a\nnuclear State, the sword of Damocles referred to here by\nPresident Clinton, and has chosen non-nuclear status.\nHaving made the appropriate commitments, we are\nfulfilling them in practice. In 1992 we were the first to\nremove tactical nuclear weapons from our territory; in fact,\nthat was done ahead of schedule. Last February, the\nParliament of Belarus virtually unanimously ratified the\nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) and the Lisbon\nProtocol to that Treaty, and also took the decision to accede,\nas a non-nuclear State, to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation\nof Nuclear Weapons. In July of this year the instruments of\naccession were deposited in Washington, Moscow and\nLondon.\nI wish to emphasize that since May 1992 - that is, since\nthe signing of the Lisbon Protocol - we have never given\nany grounds for anyone to doubt the honesty, logic and\nconsistency of our actions. Of all the States which are the\nnuclear heirs to the Soviet Union, Belarus was the first, and\nstill the only one, to have rejected nuclear weapons in\npractice. Moreover, it did so without any preconditions or\nreservations. Thus, for the first time in the history of the\ninternational community, a sovereign State has voluntarily\nrenounced a real opportunity to possess and develop nuclear\npotential. This is truly a large-scale contribution by Belarus\nto global security and the non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. I wish to emphasize once again that our words\nand deeds are not at variance.\nHaving put forward from this lofty rostrum in 1990 the\nidea of creating a non-nuclear belt from the Baltic to the\nBlack Sea, we have, to the best of our abilities, been\ntransforming our territory into part of such a belt. We hope\nthat in due course our idea will be supported and developed\nby our neighbours.\nOf great concern to the international community is the\nthreat of illegal exports from the territory of the former\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 27\nSoviet Union of nuclear materials, technology and\nequipment, which can fall into irresponsible hands.\nResponding to this danger, Belarus was the first State of the\nregion to enter into a large-scale agreement with the United\nStates to set up a stringent system for export control. Work\non implementing this agreement is already under way.\nOther initiatives put forward by my country are no less\nfamiliar to the United Nations. After many years of effort\nby Belarus, there has been agreement on international\nmachinery that has the potential to prevent States from\nreplenishing their arsenals with new types of weapons of\nmass destruction. During this session we intend to continue\nour active work in this area.\nTaking an authoritative position on these issues,\nBelarus, on behalf of and on the instructions of the States of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States, intends during\nthis session to present a joint declaration by the\nCommonwealth of Independent States on issues of the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their\ndelivery systems.\nI turn now to reductions in conventional weapons. Our\ncountry does not manufacture battle tanks, and never has.\nYet we now have more tanks per capita than any other\nEuropean State - another part of the difficult heritage of the\nformer Soviet Union. When we decided to accede to the\nTreaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, we knew full well\nthat Belarus would have to eliminate 1.7 times more tanks\nthan the United States, 10 times more than the United\nKingdom and 50 times more than France. That\ndisproportionate burden is not taken into consideration in the\nTreaty, since the Republics of the former Soviet Union had\nno opportunity to participate in its preparation.\nAt stake, however, was the fate of a highly important\ninternational agreement on which many European countries\nhad been working for more than 20 years, and so as not to\ntorpedo all that work and set Europe back many years we\nundertook that excessive burden, at great cost to ourselves.\nNow, Belarus is making an enormous contribution to\nstrengthening regional and international security by\ndestroying the weapons of what was the most powerful\nmilitary tank district in the former Soviet Union. We are\ndoing this with extreme difficulty, because of the problems\nof the present transitional period. I would note that this\noften results in a lack of understanding among our own\npeople: during an energy crisis, we are destroying tanks\nwhile we lack the energy resources to carry out our crop-\nsowing campaign.\nWeapons are immoral, just as the Moloch of war is\nimmoral. But the process of disarmament has turned out to\nbe far from idyllic: a catch-phrase of our century - \\\"Guns\nbefore butter\\\" - has been fulfilled in a most unexpected way,\nfor the destruction of the guns has done nothing to increase\nthe supply of butter.\nIn reducing its conventional weapons, Belarus is guided\nby the interests of all, and is entitled to expect reciprocity\nfrom other States in overcoming its difficulties.\nOn the whole, the heritage of the former Soviet Union\nhas been a difficult one: an economy among the most\nhighly militarized, and large military contingents. Suffice it\nto say that at the start of 1992 there were three times as\nmany soldiers and officers per thousand civilians on our\nterritory as there were on average in the USSR.\nWorking sincerely to keep Belarus neutral, our\nParliament and our Government have adopted a policy\nintended to demilitarize the national economy, including a\n50 per cent reduction in our army over five years and the\ndevelopment and adoption of a defensive military doctrine.\nHaving lived over the centuries through the horror of\nnumerous wars, and having lost in their flames millions upon\nmillions of its citizens, the Republic of Belarus will do its\nutmost to ensure that the firestorm of military confrontation\nwill never again consume its territory.\nI shall deal now with ethnic conflicts.\nAcute and bloody ethnic, religious and intercommunal\nclashes have become a dangerous feature of the new world.\nThe deep, often irrational, roots of these conflicts pose an\nespecially difficult challenge to the entire international\ncommunity, for they do not respond to simple prescriptions\nfor settlement. In Belarus, profound social transformations\nare taking place against a background of unique mutual\ntolerance among varied ethnic, cultural and religious groups\nwithin our society. Not a single drop of blood has stained\nthe soil of Belarus during this difficult time of transition.\nWe shall continue to do our best so that Belarus, nestled in\nthe very heart of the European continent, can continue to set\nan example of political, ethnic and religious balance.\nBelarus is unique in its humanistic spirit, which can\nguarantee stability and irreversible democratic reform, and\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwe sincerely offer to the Security Council our experience of\ncoexistence among different ethnic groups and the centuries-\nold tradition of national, cultural and religious tolerance that\nis a feature of our country.\nI am sure that tolerance can be an important key to the\nresolution of any conflict. With international effort, we can\nsucceed. It was tolerance in the highest sense of the word\nthat made possible a recent handshake, which finally opened\nthe way to what had seemed the impossible: a Middle East\nsettlement. It is tolerance that will determine the success of\nthe process under way in South Africa, and it is a lack of\ntolerance that is delaying the settlement of the crisis in\nBosnia.\nInstability; ethnic and religious clashes; ethnic and\nregional separatism; internal political strife: they have all\nreached tragic levels in the post-Soviet areas. In a number\nof cases, they have grown into local military conflicts, and\neven wars. The internal stability of Belarus and its position\nat the centre - serving as host to the coordinating bodies of\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States - give Belarus the\npotential to be a peacemaking mediator in such conflicts.\nFor example, we sincerely wish to help settle the\nproblem of Nagorny-Karabakh. Belarus remains ready to\nassist in convening the international conference on Nagorny-\nKarabakh, under the auspices of the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), to be held in our\ncapital, Minsk, on a date to be determined by the\nparticipants.\nWe believe that the neutrality proclaimed by Belarus is\nan international asset. This constitutional objective enables\nus to adopt a wider, unbiased approach to determining our\npositions on various issues. We do this taking due account\nof the realities of today\u2019s world and of our place in that\nworld. We strive to pursue our policies in such a way as to\nlay the foundation for a prosperous and neutral Belarus.\nSpecifically, we are moving towards the development and\nimplementation of the principles of democracy.\nThe Belarus Parliament is in the final stages of\nconsidering our new Constitution, which will consolidate the\nirreversibility of the democratization of our State. We are\nbuilding a new political structure: new political parties,\nnational, social and political movements, and hundreds of\ncivic organizations have been officially registered and have\nbegun their political activities.\nAmong these organizations is the League for the\nProtection of Human Rights. The evolving human-rights\nstatus of Belarus is up to international standards. As early\nas 1991 we ratified the Optional Protocol to the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and recognized the\ncompetence of the Human Rights Committee, in keeping\nwith article 41 of the Covenant.\nBelarus commends the results of the second World\nConference on Human Rights, held this year in Vienna. The\nConference in particular reiterated the obligations of States\nto ensure completely and effectively all human rights and\nfundamental freedoms without any discrimination whatever\nagainst persons belonging to national minorities. We attach\ngreat importance to this provision.\nBelarus has created and is still creating all the\nnecessary conditions for national minorities that live in its\nterritory so that they can fully enjoy human rights. But at\nthe same time we are far from being indifferent to the\ntreatment of Belarusians who live beyond our national\nterritory and will continue in future to follow closely the\nsituation of more than 2 million ethnic Belarusians who live\nin different countries of the world.\nEconomic reforms are gaining ground in the Republic.\nA gradual movement towards a market economy has\nincreased the level of openness of the economy and has\nlimited the State\u2019s monopoly in a number of areas of life.\nConcrete steps towards creating a private sector have been\ntaken. The law on private landed property, which is of\nfundamental importance in this respect, has been in force\nsince 1 September. The adoption of these legislative acts,\nlike the laws on property, entrepreneurship, and foreign\ninvestment, has created the basis for the further development\nof market relations. Right now Belarus is on the threshold\nof a wider stage of its privatization.\nThe Republic of Belarus, like other States of this\nregion, is vitally concerned about developing and\nstrengthening multilateral cooperation in the economic field.\nWe believe that there are forms of discrimination and\nlimitation with respect to the States of Central and Eastern\nEurope which should, along with the cold war, become a\nthing of the past. Any delay here will be at variance with\nthe political and economic realities of the world.\nBelarus is striving to lift barriers and limitations in the\nfield of trade and has taken a decision to start negotiations\non its accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT). We also hope that very soon the Uruguay\nRound will be successfully completed.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 29\nIntegration on a new level of economic activity within\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is especially\nurgent for us. Belarus was one of the main initiators for\nsetting up an economic union within the framework of the\nCIS and of concluding an appropriate agreement to that\neffect. It is with great pleasure that I state that an agreement\non setting up such an economic union was signed recently,\nunder the chairmanship of Mr. Shushkevich, in Moscow at\nthe meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the CIS.\nThis opens up favourable prospects for the economic\nstabilization of the Commonwealth of Independent States and\nfor the gradual overcoming of the most acute problems of\nthis transitional stage. I am convinced that the agreements\nreached in Moscow will mark a transition towards radically\nnew relations, that is, market relations, and will inevitably\nlead to the formation on that basis of the eastern European\ncommonwealth, a geopolitical and economic group of a\nmarket type that will gradually, but at the same time\nconsistently and unswervingly, become integrated into\nEuropean and world economic structures.\nThese new prospects encourage us also because they\nwill help Belarus, I hope, in the near future to strengthen its\nreal capacity to pay and settle to a large extent the problem\nof our financial obligations to the United Nations.\nWe are well aware of the acuteness of the financial\nsituation of the Organization. That is why, despite our own\nextremely difficult economic and financial situation, the\nGovernment of Belarus recently made a contribution\namounting to $3.5 million to the budget of the Organization\nand, in effect, has fully settled its arrears. I wish to assure\nMembers of the United Nations that we will\ncontinue to do what we can within our very limited\nresources. But the United Nations itself through its main\norgan the General Assembly must take steps to have the\nfinancial obligations of Belarus strictly match our real\ncapacity to pay. In particular the new realities warrant a\ndecision without further delay on the relocation of our\ncountry from Group B to Group C in the scheme of the\napportionment of expenses for United Nations peace-keeping\noperations.\nAt the beginning of my statement I mentioned the great\nhopes for the future which Belarus places on United Nations\nactivities. However, there is one very special area for us in\nwhich United Nations assistance is vitally important, and that\nis the environment and our \\\"eternal wound that does not\nheal\\\" - Chernobyl - the most terrible nuclear disaster.\nAlong with the growth of cancer, especially among\nchildren, of great concern to us recently has been the social\nand psychological stress among our people. The birth rate\nhas fallen dramatically and the number of psychogenic\ndiseases has been growing rapidly. People are overwhelmed\nby a concern about their health and the health of their\nchildren. This has also affected the pace of the Republic\u2019s\ntransition to new social and economic realities. We call\nupon the United Nations, in close cooperation with the\nCommission of the European Communities, to continue their\nefforts to further study and overcome the consequences of\nthe Chernobyl disaster. We hope that in the process of\nreforming the United Nations system and its Secretariat the\nnecessary institutional and programme mechanisms will be\nworked out to further carry out Chernobyl-related activities\nin the interests of the entire international community, taking\ninto consideration the great significance and uniqueness of\nthe lessons of the Chernobyl tragedy.\nThe activities carried out by the new United Nations\nCoordinator on Chernobyl, Mr. Jan Eliasson, the beginning\nof whose work is greatly appreciated by us, gives us hope\nthat the United Nations potential will be used actively\nenough to yield tangible practical results.\nIn the post-Chernobyl era we need moral and\npsychological support, sometimes simply compassion. In\nthis connection I should like to recall the words of a great\nRussian writer, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who is connected to\nBelarus by birth. He once declared that beauty and the\nnobility of human relations would save the world. To that\nI would add compassion because they in effect are\ninseparable since beauty is always noble while compassion\nand nobility are always beautiful.\nBelarus, living through the post-Chernobyl nightmare,\nhaving over centuries survived the nightmare of many raids,\ninvasions and wars, poverty and hardship, understands the\npain, the suffering, of the peoples of the developing\ncountries as no other country does. Poverty, diseases, child\nmortality, in many parts of the world cannot leave people of\ngood will indifferent. Indeed it is immoral to fail to take\nnote of this. I am convinced that the new world order will\nentail a fairer distribution of the world\u2019s wealth and it will\nbe marked by assistance to those who for decades have been\nunjustifiably doomed to poverty, stagnation and predictable\nbackwardness and have had to be content with the remaining\ncrumbs of the wealth produced by them but then\nredistributed and not in their favour.\nAs one of the original members of the Commission on\nSustainable Development, our country is striving to\n30 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncontribute to its work in a way that reflects the ecological\nand economic interests of all groups of States in a balanced\nmanner. We support efforts to elaborate an international\nconvention on desertification; the search for a solution to the\nproblems of the small developing island States; and the\nsearch for new and additional resources for developing\ncountries.\nAware, under the conditions of post-Chernobyl realities,\nof the significance of ecological problems in finding a\nsolution, Belarus has been actively supporting the\nimplementation of the decisions and recommendations of the\nfirst-ever summit in history held in the interests of the Earth.\nThe Parliament of the Republic of Belarus has already\nratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and is now\nexamining the issue of acceding to the Convention on\nClimate Change. We support priority consideration of\necological problems within the context of international\ncooperation, and the Republic of Belarus supports the idea\nof transforming, in the near future, the Commission on\nSustainable Development into the United Nations council on\necological security. We are ready to contribute to the\nelaboration of its structure and mandate.\nThe United Nations is moving from the old epoch to\nthe new one with an imposing baggage. Certain parts of it\nhave already become obsolete and will be of interest only to\nhistorical researchers; others contain the grains of that new\nfuture role to be played by the United Nations in this quickly\nevolving world which I have already spoken about - for\nexample, a positive and future-oriented experience of large-\nscale peace-keeping operations in Namibia and Cambodia.\nStanding on the threshold of the third millennium, one can\nhardly envisage all of the details of the general picture of the\nfuture world. However, the prospects that lie ahead are what\nmatters most, and they are clearly visible. From the role of\ncease-fire organizer to the role of peace guarantor, from the\nrole of peace guarantor to the role of co-organizer of life in\nthe international community, a wise and authoritative\narbitrator whose political will is without doubt recognized by\nall: that is the way we see the role of the United Nations in\nthe next century. Meeting the challenges of the time,\nBelarus is ready to work together with other friendly States,\nincluding, if this is the will of the General Assembly, within\nthe Security Council of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate\nHis Excellency Mr. Insanally on his election to the\npresidency of the forty-eighth session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly. Given his talent and experience, I am\nconfident that he will guide this session to the successful\ncompletion of the noble mission entrusted to it by the\nCharter of the United Nations. I would also like to express\nmy appreciation and thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Ganev,\nfor the contribution he made to accomplishing the tasks of\nthe last session.\nI wish to take this opportunity to extend my warm\nwelcome and congratulations to the six States that have been\nadmitted to membership of the United Nations over the past\nyear.\nI stand before the Assembly as the Foreign Minister of\na small, land-locked, newly independent country of 3.5\nmillion under complete blockade, with no energy resources,\nstill not recovered from the devastating earthquake of 1988,\nflooded by hundred of thousands of refugees fleeing the\nconflict between Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, and\nunder constant provocation by Azerbaijan to be drawn into\nthat conflict.\nI am also the Foreign Minister of the only democracy\nin the region, an island of stability in a sea of political chaos\nand turmoil, a country with close to 30 registered political\nparties, a free press and freedom of conscience and religion,\nand with laws guaranteeing civil and political rights and\nfreedoms. The Government of Armenia has also made\nheadway towards establishing a market economy and has\ntaken several significant steps to integrate its economy into\nthe global economy. Armenia has moved swiftly in many\nareas of reform. Most agricultural land and homes and\nmany small enterprises have already been privatized, and a\ntax programme, a pricing policy and legislative reform to\ncreate the legal framework for a free-market economy are\neffectively under way. Nevertheless, substantial work will\nneed to be done if these advances are to contribute\neffectively to a successful transition.\nIt is encouraging to see that the United Nations has\nrecognized that full integration of the economies in transition\ninto the world economy will not only help those economies\nbut also have a positive impact on world trade, economic\ngrowth and development, and is prepared to support the\nprocess of bringing about economic reform and restructuring\nthrough its special bodies and specialized agencies.\nI wish to take this opportunity to convey my\nGovernment\u2019s deep gratitude to the Secretary-General for\nestablishing the United Nations - United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) interim office in Armenia.\nAs a result of adverse natural and geopolitical circumstances,\nArmenia is currently in a state of economic and social crisis.\nWe see the importance of short-term assistance in these\ntimes of great need, but at the same time are fully aware that\nit is the pursuit of long-term goals that will bring Armenia\nto function at full capacity as a member of the international\ncommunity. We are convinced that the presence of United\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 7\nNations specialized agencies in Armenia such as the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the\nWorld Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), and the United Nations\nFund for Population Activities (UNFPA), providing technical\nand advisory assistance and coordination would enhance the\ndurability of the transition that is well under way.\nAs we and other nations grapple with problems unique\nto each, the collapse of regimes and empires continues to\nfuel violent conflicts throughout the world. But there is an\napparent change in the pattern of international conflicts.\nVery few wars are fought between nation States any more.\nThe rest are struggles for self-determination turned into\nbloody conflict and civil war in one and the same nation\nState. These movements need a forum in which to lodge\ntheir claims, identify and understand their rights, negotiate\nwith government authorities, establish just administration of\ntheir affairs, and peacefully work out realistic political and\nterritorial arrangements for the future.\nNow more than ever, it is incumbent upon the United\nNations to revisit its provision of non-intervention in matters\nwhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of\nMember States, and to define more stringently the extent of\nthe impact of a conflict on the peace and security of other\nnations. Having in clear view the essential role the United\nNations can play in enhancing peacemaking efforts\nthroughout the world, we concur with recent proposals in\nacademic circles that the United Nations transform the\nnear-moribund Trusteeship Council into a modern clearing-\nhouse for self-determination.\nUnder the proposed system, a \\\"trust territory\\\" would be\nthat part of a Member State voluntarily placed into\ntrusteeship by the Government of that State for the purpose\nof resolving a self-determination claim under United Nations\nsupervision without prejudicing the final status of the\nterritory. We believe that the trusteeship system could save\nlives and prevent the escalation of a self-determination\nstruggle to a devastating civil war, or worse, to a regional\nconflict involving other countries.\nThe conflict over Nagorny-Karabakh has claimed the\nlives of more than 10,000 people and has caused close to a\nmillion innocent people to be uprooted from their homes\nduring the past five years. This conflict continues to\nthreaten the security and stability of the whole region. The\ninternational community has yet to come to grips with the\nroot cause of the conflict and devise appropriate measures to\nfind a peaceful solution.\nArmenia\u2019s position on the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict\nhas been clear and consistent since day one. The conflict is\nbetween the people of Nagorny-Karabakh, who are striving\nfor their self-determination, and the Azerbaijani Government,\nwhich is refusing to address the rights and security concerns\nof the people of Nagorny-Karabakh.\nAs an interested party, Armenia has advocated an\nunconditional cease-fire and has fully supported all the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\ninitiatives. The Government of Armenia sees no alternative\nto the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, than that\nwhich can be reached within the framework of the CSCE\nMinsk Conference.\nThe recent developments of the peace process are\npromising. Nagorny-Karabakh has at long last been\nrecognized as a party to the conflict and direct talks between\nthe leadership of Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijani\nauthorities, mediated by the Russian Federation, have\nbrought about a cease-fire, which has continued to hold for\nmore than a month now and is unprecedented in the\nfive-year history of this bloody conflict. On 28 September\nduring its meeting in Paris, the Minsk Group produced the\n\\\"Adjusted timetable of urgent steps to implement Security\nCouncil resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993)\\\", to which\nArmenia has given its agreement, and is hopeful that a\nsimilar position will be adopted by the main parties to the\nconflict, Azerbaijan and Nagorny-Karabakh.\nThere is now a genuine opportunity for peace.\nTherefore, the convening of the Minsk Conference must not\nbe delayed. Once peace is established, legal questions, first\nand foremost among which is the issue of the status of\nNagorny-Karabakh, can be negotiated. The clear position of\nthe Government of Armenia is to accept and be gratified by\nany solution agreed upon between Nagorny-Karabakh and\nAzerbaijan at the Minsk Conference.\nThe CSCE has an explicit security role in the new\nworld order, consistent with the provisions of Chapter VIII\nof the United Nations Charter. Last May, the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman\nof the CSCE Council agreed on a framework for cooperation\nand coordination between the United Nations Secretariat and\nthe CSCE, namely through the regular exchange of\ninformation in the fields of early warning, conflict\nprevention and the promotion of democratic values and\nhuman rights. The CSCE is also striving to obtain United\nNations observer status, an initiative which Armenia fully\nsupports.\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe successful cooperation between the United Nations\nand the CSCE over the Nagorny-Karabakh conflict can serve\nas a case study in how to reconcile, practically, the\nconflicting claims of regionalism and universalism. Such\ncooperation will enhance the role of regional organizations\nin conflict prevention, peace-keeping and the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes.\nArmenia appreciates the Secretary-General\u2019s report \\\"An\nAgenda for Peace\\\" which embodies the notions of\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and post-conflict peace--\nbuilding. History has taught us, however, that development\nis intrinsic to peace, and that the two can no longer be\nthought of as separate processes. Starvation, poverty and\npoor living conditions in many parts of the world loom as\nserious threats to stability and peace. The United Nations in\nits commitment to secure peace for all the Earth\u2019s\ninhabitants must place development high among its priorities.\nIndeed, it must establish economic and social development\nas guiding principles for the Organization\u2019s activities.\nArmenia fully supports the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative for\nan agenda for development and looks forward to contributing\nto this important milestone towards world peace. Armenia\nalso gives its full support to the convocation of the 1995\nWorld Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen.\nToday, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\nposes another grave threat to both global and regional\nsecurity and stability. Armenia supports the indefinite\nextension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\nbeyond 1995. The United Nations should work to ensure\nuniversality and strict compliance with the Convention on\nthe prohibition of chemical weapons.\nDevelopment and human rights are also mutually\ninclusive values. There can be no genuine development\nunless systems of thought and government are based on\nrespect for the full spectrum of the rights of individuals. It\nis auspicious that this year coincides with the forty-fifth\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe spirit of the Declaration and the Vienna World\nConference on Human Rights held last June will\nundoubtedly deepen the understanding of the significance of\nhuman rights for stability, freedom, peace, progress and\njustice.\nIt is my Government\u2019s strong conviction that the\nadoption and implementation of all human rights principles\nby nation States will create solid ground for unity and\nharmony throughout a world which is being transformed and\nis searching for new constants.\nFor more effective implementation of the principles of\nhuman rights we feel it is imperative to establish the post of\nhigh commissioner for human rights and a permanent\ninternational criminal court where cases of gross violations\nof human rights and other crimes against humanity are\nsubmitted and prosecuted.\nIn 1995, the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. In the past 50 years, the Organization has\ngrown and has witnessed historic events, in many of which\nit has played a considerable role. As the Organization has\nentered a period in which it is being called upon to take an\nincreasingly active guiding role in a changing world, it too\nmust be prepared to respond effectively to these changes.\nArmenia supports the call for restructuring the Security\nCouncil that has been placed before the United Nations by\nits Member States. Because the international community is\nlooking to the Security Council to take a more dynamic role\nin the maintenance of international peace, it is necessary that\nthe Security Council increase its membership in order that it\nmay be able to address the issues before it in a more\nbalanced and equitable way.\nImproving the United Nations administrative\nperformance must also become a top priority at this time.\nWe welcome the current initiatives of the Secretary-General\nto streamline the Organization\u2019s administrative and\nmanagement structures and procedures to meet the demands\nthat are now being placed upon the Organization.\nAs the world seems to have grown accustomed to the\ndreadful routine of tragic news coming from various regional\nhotbeds, it is inspiring to reflect on some of the more\npositive reverberations of the end of the cold war, which can\nbe epitomized by the historic accord between the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) and Israel signed recently.\nIt is my privilege to salute the leaders of Israel and the PLO\nfor taking this courageous step.\nNo less significant are the processes currently in motion\nin South Africa. Armenia joins the other Member States in\nsupporting the negotiating process there, and believes that\nlifting economic sanctions at this time could encourage the\npeople of South Africa to take up the task of building a truly\nfree and democratic country.\nIn the United Nations, the end of the cold war\ncontinues to translate into ever closer cooperation between\nits Members. In 1992, as in 1991, despite the large volume\nand the diversified nature of the issues examined in the\nSecurity Council, none of the members of the Council\nexercised its right to veto. There is a growing harmony of\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 9\ninterests among nations that is creating an atmosphere of\ntrust and cooperation, which are the prerequisites for the\nrealization of the goals envisioned by the founders of the\nUnited Nations 48 years ago in San Francisco.\nIndeed, for the first time since its inception, the United\nNations has been given the opportunity to become what it\nwas intended to be: a collective security system, with a\nCharter providing for special forms of cooperation between\nsovereign States, designed to ensure peace and prosperity\nthroughout the world.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with pleasure that, on\nbehalf of the Ghana delegation, I convey to Mr. Insanally of\nGuyana our congratulations on his election, by acclamation,\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. He assumes this high office at a momentous time\nin the history of mankind, as we endeavour to establish a\nnew world order based on freedom and justice. The skills\nand experience that he brings to his office assure us of\nsuccess during his tenure. The cordial relations that happily\nexist between the President\u2019s country and mine increase our\nsatisfaction, hopes and expectations. We pledge to him and\nto the Bureau our full cooperation and support.\nLet me place on record also our appreciation of the\neffective leadership that the President\u2019s predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, gave to our Organization\nduring his stewardship. His ability to navigate the General\nAssembly through the turbulence of a contradictory context\nin international relations was admirable.\nOnce again, the Secretary-General has shown, through\na display of his remarkable skills as a thinker, an\nadministrator and an accomplished diplomat, that he is on\ntop of his job. The credit is no doubt shared by the staff,\nwhose dedication and commitment have been maintained.\nThe universality of the General Assembly, which makes\nit the most representative organ of the Organization, has\nagain been reaffirmed with the admission of five new\nMember States since August 1992. We take this opportunity\nto welcome them and to extend to them the cooperation of\nthe Ghana delegation.\nThe search for enduring peace is still the greatest\nchallenge of the Organization, in spite of the end of the cold\nwar. The collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist\nRepublics and the accession to independence of its\nconstituent parts, the freedom and independence of the\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 21\ncountries of Eastern Europe, German reunification, and the\ncold-war relics of trouble spots have brought to the fore\n\\\"Simmering disputes, violent conflicts, aggression and\nforeign occupation, interference in the internal affairs of\nStates, policies of hegemony and domination, ethnic\nstrife, religious intolerance, new forms of racism and\nnarrowly conceived nationalism\\\", (A/47/675, annex,\npara. 3)\nas the Jakarta Message of 1992 of the Non-Aligned\nMovement so aptly stated.\nAt the same time, our world is faced with an economic\nand a social situation similar to that which preceded the two\nworld wars. All these developments, aggravated by global\nrecession, threaten to undermine the purposes of the United\nNations.\nWe must continue to pursue the goal of total\ndisarmament. We should like the proposed United Nations\nRegister of Conventional Arms to include nations\u2019\nproduction of arms and all other weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nThe goal of complete and total disarmament would\nobviously be easier to pursue in an environment of peace\nbased on mutual confidence. It is in this context that we\nwelcome the efforts of the United Nations to shoulder the\nincreasing burden of peace-keeping and peacemaking. In\nCambodia, Mozambique, Angola, South Africa, the former\nYugoslavia, Somalia, the Middle East, Cyprus, and\nelsewhere, the efforts of the United Nations have served as\na positive check on the threat to international peace and\nsecurity. There are, however, lessons to be drawn for\ncurrent and future operations. The holding of elections in\nAngola and in Cambodia without the fulfilment of certain\nconditions, such as the disarming and cantonment of troops,\nwas tactically unhelpful, in spite of the circumstances that\nled to the elections - a mistake which, thankfully, the United\nNations does not intend to repeat in Mozambique. We\nshould also remind ourselves that peacemaking may be a\nslow and painful process. The need to retain the confidence\nof all parties and their support for, and participation in, the\nprocess is fundamental and crucial to the success of such\noperations.\nWe are disappointed at the instability that continues to\nengulf the former Yugoslavia. Whilst we still regret the\ninitial reaction of the international community - in particular,\nthe regional institutions - to developments there, we wish to\nreiterate that unrestrained nationalism that seeks justification\nin the much-cherished principle of self- determination is\nunacceptable. Furthermore, the expression of such\nnationalism in \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" is as barbaric and revolting\nas it is reprehensible and totally at variance with civilized\nbehaviour. The readiness of the United Nations to act\ndecisively in Somalia contrasts sharply with the timidity and\nhesitation that have marked our presence in the former\nYugoslavia and threaten to erode the credibility of the\nOrganization. It is for these reasons that we welcome\nSecurity Council resolution 859 (1993), in which the\nCouncil, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, calls for\nthe immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities\nthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that are\nessential if a just and equitable political solution to the\nconflict is to be achieved through peaceful negotiations. We\nexpect the Security Council to monitor the implementation\nof the resolution.\nMy Government warmly welcomes the historic\nagreements on limited autonomy for Palestine and on mutual\nrecognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization. These accords are a tribute to the courage,\nforesight, determination and outstanding statesmanship of\nChairman Yasser Arafat and of Prime \nMinister Yitzhak Rabin. They usher in the beginning of the\nend of decades of war, mistrust, violence, destruction and\nwanton killing and suffering that the Arab-Israeli conflict has\nbrought to the people of the Middle East. They lay a solid\nfoundation for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the\nMiddle East. We therefore urge the entire international\ncommunity to support them.\nFrom the new dawn of relations in the Middle East\nemerges a powerful, compelling and inspiring truth - that\nthere is no conflict that is not capable of solution. That is\nwhy we consider that the \\\"no war, no peace\\\" situation in\nCyprus should not be permitted to lure this Organization into\ncomplacency. The search for a settlement should be\naccelerated. To this end, the recent decision to maintain the\nUnited Nations presence in Cyprus should encourage all the\nparties involved.\nThe situation in Sudan, equally, cries out for a peaceful\nsolution and for greater United Nations involvement as a\ncontribution to the search for an enduring settlement to an\nessentially political problem that has brought such suffering\nto the people and has created an unbearable refugee problem\nfor neighbouring States.\nOur Organization has recorded laudable success in its\nimplementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)\non the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nColonial Countries and Peoples. The independence of\nNamibia is the latest of the success stories of decolonization.\nHowever, the Territories and peoples that remain under\ncolonial rule demand our active and sustained attention and\nrender premature any conclusion that the decolonization\nprocess has been completed.\nWe welcome the progress that has been made in the\nnegotiations in South Africa. However, the international\ncommunity needs to remind itself that apartheid is far from\nbeing completely eradicated. The process of democratization\nin that country must be completed so that all its citizens may\nbe enabled to exercise their voting rights. The world\ncommunity has a responsibility to maintain its vigilance\nregarding South Africa until the election on 27 April 1994,\nwhich will put in place an acceptable constitutional\nprogramme for a transitional Government based, for the first\ntime in the history of that country, on universal adult\nsuffrage.\nOf equal concern is the impasse over Western Sahara.\nThe United Nations peace plan must be allowed to work,\nand the timetable set for the holding of elections must be\nrespected by all. In the light of the call for a more prudent\nuse of the resources available to the United Nations, it is\nimperative that the task of the United Nations Mission for\nthe Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) be\ncompleted rapidly, to the full satisfaction of all concerned,\nparticularly the Sahraoui people.\nThe new impetus for peacemaking and peace-keeping\nrepresents a major advance in our collective engagement in\nthe task of seeking and creating a peaceful and safe world.\nIn this Assembly it has been suggested that the United\nNations should limit its commitments, that it should not take\non every conflict. But which conflicts must it address, and\nwhich ones should it decline to get involved in? That is the\ncrucial question. The unity of the purposes of the Charter\nand the universality of our Organization compel us to\nrecognize that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to peace\neverywhere.\nBut even if the suggestions have merit, either on the\ngrounds of lack of funds, constraints in logistics or the\nUnited Nations inability to heal all the world\u2019s wounds, my\ndelegation wants to stress the need for the United Nations to\nsee all the peace-keeping assignments it is engaged in\nthrough to their logical conclusion. The United Nations\ncannot, at this juncture, turn its back on South Africa,\nLiberia, Rwanda, Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Somalia or\nthe former Yugoslavia. It would be a sad day indeed if all\nthese laudable initiatives were abandoned on the grounds of\nwell-reasoned arguments pleading lack of funds or of the\nwill to help these nations enjoy the peace that has eluded\nthem for years.\nIn recognition of the fact that the United Nations cannot\nundertake too many initiatives, it should devise mechanisms\nfor shoring up regional efforts at conflict resolution, such as\nin Liberia. We also wish to stress that the internal parties to\nthe various conflicts which the United Nations is striving so\nhard to resolve have a moral responsibility to play their part\nin accelerating the process towards peace. Human decency\nand the sanctity of human life impose this duty on them. In\nthis respect, we must encourage the Inkatha Freedom Party\nand other right-wing groups to join the process of\nnegotiations in South Africa, and we should condemn in no\nuncertain terms the treachery of UNITA and the attitude of\nsome of the Somali warlords.\nWhatever mistakes the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia (UNOSOM) may have made, it is grotesque for any\nSomali leader to seek to be a hero by engaging the United\nNations in combat. Such a show of ingratitude may have\nlong-term damaging consequences in terms of the\nwillingness of Member States to undertake humanitarian\nmissions. And what would be the consequences for the\nSomali people should the United Nations decide to abort\nUNOSOM? Any leader who has the interest of his people at\nheart needs to reflect on that.\nIt is noteworthy that many of the conflicts plaguing us\nare in the developing countries. We hope the call for\nlimiting the peace-keeping role of the United Nations is not\nan attempt to shirk the burden of engaging in solving the\npolitical problems in these countries in the same way as the\nfundamental economic concerns of these countries have been\nmarginalized.\nAs we concern ourselves with the resolution of these\nsometimes malignant conflicts, let us not forget to address\nthe fundamental factors that generate many of them. We\nknow that a great proportion of these problems can be traced\nto economic deprivation and underdevelopment. My\ndelegation has stressed time and again in this Assembly and\nelsewhere that underdevelopment and conflicts have a link.\nIt is often the poorest countries or countries where economic\ndecline has been steep that relapse into savage violence. We\nhave also said that the source of the condition of\nunderdevelopment can be largely traced to a global economic\nsystem that has been inimical to the interests of developing\nand poor countries.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 23\nIt is time the United Nations, in its effort to construct\npeace and keep the peace, addressed some of the\nfundamental economic issues that hamper all efforts to\neradicate global poverty. In this connection, the perennial\nproblems that plague the economies of the South must now\nbe fully tackled as part of the energetic search for world\npeace. We have said in almost all United Nations forums,\nincluding the Assembly, that the debt burden cripples our\neconomies. We have spoken regularly about the\nunacceptable levels of resource flow from the poor nations\nto the rich. We have drawn regular attention to the unequal\nterms of trade, protectionist barriers and a disastrous global\npricing system that does not pay us adequately for the fruits\nof our labour, whether we produce coffee, cocoa or copper.\nIt is time the United Nations placed development and\nthe crucial need for restructuring the world economy on its\npriority list side-by-side with, if not above, its peace-keeping\nand peacemaking agenda. The United Nations must defend\neach nation\u2019s right to earn its way by being an equal\nparticipant in the global market place. Many of us have\nundertaken structural adjustments. Yet the returns of the\ngreat sacrifices we have made remain low. So many of us\ncannot provide adequate social services in the form of\nschools, clinics or clean water for our people. In many\ninstances, bowing to the conditions set for the loans we\ncontract to expand our export base, we have to lay off\nworkers and thus consign thousands or even millions of\nfamilies to indigence as the small pay check that puts a meal\non the table, buys medicine when the child is sick, or\nprovides the uniform for the new school-goer in the family,\nis no longer forthcoming.\nThe United Nations has been advised, correctly in our\nview, to run efficient peace-keeping operations, to refurbish\nitself administratively and to upgrade its skills in all the\nspheres of its endeavours. We wish to add that the United\nNations must now also place upon its active agenda the\nquestion of development and tackle it with the seriousness\nit deserves. We have striven in this Organization to link the\nenvironment, human rights, democracy and humanitarian\nrelief with development. It is time we realized that\npeace-keeping and peacemaking can be carried out\nefficiently, and the problems that generate conflicts can be\nresolved, only if we promote the issue of development with\nvigour. And this can be done if the United Nations insists\non a more just, equitable and transparent world economic\nsystem that will confer the means for development on all\nnations. The task of eradicating global poverty must receive\nthe same attention, concentration and energetic action as are\ngiven to peace-keeping and peacemaking.\nThe democratization process, which is part of the effort\nto promote and uphold human rights, should not be limited\nto the national level. The full implementation of the\nprinciples of democracy within the family of nations should\nalso be one of our central concerns. It is in this context that\nwe seek the revitalization of the General Assembly, where\nthe sovereign equality of Member States finds full\nexpression. We look forward to the General Assembly\u2019s\nplaying its full role in the maintenance of international peace\nand security as required by the Charter. We also welcome\nthe initiative of the Security Council to make its work,\nincluding its decision-making process, more transparent.\nSuch transparency will obviously enhance the legitimacy of\nits decisions and, equally importantly, reflect the fact that it\nis the Members of the Organization which, under Article 24,\nconfer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and that in\ndischarging its functions the Security Council acts on their\nbehalf.\nMy delegation sees no need to go over the case, which\nhas already been well established, for the reform of the\nSecurity Council. Suffice it to say that, whatever the final\nform of a restructured Security Council, it is clear that its\nreform should be based on the principle of the sovereign\nequality of Member States and the clear\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nrecognition that the Security Council acts on behalf of the\nMembers of the Organization and should reflect the\nuniversality of our Organization. The Ghana delegation is\nready to participate in the search for a more legitimate and\neffective Security Council.\nWe welcome the commitment made by\nPresident Clinton to ensure the payment of contributions due\nfrom the United States in respect of peace-keeping\noperations. It is to be hoped that in the years to come the\nUnited States, which pays a substantial portion of the United\nNations budget, regular and peace-keeping, will continue to\nabide by this commitment and also address the question of\noutstanding contributions to the regular budget.\nIt is the hope of Ghana that this session will mark the\nbeginning of the renaissance of the United Nations, ready to\ncollectively commit itself to the pursuit of the objectives of\nour Organization as reflected in the principles and purposes\nof the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "It is always an honour and\na great pleasure to address the General Assembly. My first\ntask, a happy one, is to congratulate you, Sir, most warmly\non your election as President of the forty-eighth session of\nthe General Assembly. We know that in your hands this\nwill be a session of accomplishments.\nLet me also thank your able predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria, for his\noutstanding service during the forty-seventh session.\nI would next express our concern and sadness over the\nrecent disastrous earthquake in India and extend to the\nGovernment and, especially, to the families affected our\nprofound sympathies.\nTwo years ago, when I last stood here, there was a\nsense of high expectation, for we were witnessing the drama\nof political changes to a new world. Many new nation\nStates emerged from that process. We welcome the newest -\nand some of the smallest - Members of our global family\nwho joined us this year: the Principality of Andorra, Eritrea,\nthe Czech Republic, the Principality of Monaco, The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Slovak Republic.\nAs a small State itself, Samoa is particularly pleased to add\nits welcome, assured of the contribution these new Members\nwill make to our common effort.\nLet me also pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and\nexpress to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our\ndeepest admiration and appreciation for the spirit of reform\nand quality of leadership he brings to the work of the\nOrganization.\nWith one voice we in this Hall have hailed the ending\nof East-West tensions. We are right to do so. It has\nbrought about deep and positive changes. Now, as never\nbefore, the international community has real opportunities for\ncooperation and peace. In Washington, barely a month ago\ntoday, leaders of two great peoples, men of magnificent\ncourage and foresight, seized such an opportunity for the\nIsraelis and Palestinians. In our global village there is an\nimperative to secure a comprehensive, just and durable\nsolution to the overall Arab-Israeli conflict. In turn, that\npeace effort needs to be able to draw sustenance - moral,\npolitical and financial - from the whole family of nations.\nMost warmly we applaud the courage and vision of this bold\nstep. From our distance, and no matter how inadequate, I\npledge to the people of Israel and to the Palestinians\nSamoa\u2019s entire support.\nBut the new opportunities for cooperation in this post-\ncold-war era are being severely challenged by conflicts that\nrage in many lands and by the human misery they cause.\nTragedy and carnage are seemingly endless in Bosnia, in\nSomalia, and in territories of the former Soviet Union. In\nother areas, too - far too many - we witness daily the most\nshocking violations of the human person and wanton\ndisregard for the rule of law. This year alone, there have\nbeen close to 25 substantial conflicts in the world.\nAnd war is not the only scourge. For we have not\nfreed our world of hunger, poverty or illness. Millions of\npeople have fled from internal strife and persecution, famine\nand natural disasters. Millions more are migrating for\neconomic reasons.\nIn my part of the world, island communities now live\nunder the constant threat of ecological disasters. A rise in\nsea levels and destructive tropical cyclones are particular\ndangers. The evidence we have is that these are the global\nand adverse effects of induced climate change. They prey\non the natural vulnerabilities of many lands and their\npeoples, and severely undermine the national livelihood and\neconomic development efforts of many Governments.\nMy purpose is not simply to catalogue misery and the\nnegative, but rather to point to the vastness of our task.\nThere is no scope for retreat - we must advance with\nresolve. The world cries out for responses and solutions.\nAnd the fact is, the world is now looking more and more to\nthe United Nations. We do not, for a moment, delude\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nourselves about the complexities of these conflicts or the\ndepth of longstanding animosities - least of all, in the\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia. But I am compelled to\nsay that the horrors being perpetuated in Bosnia offend\ncommon decency and almost every principle for which this\nOrganization stands.\nThat is why we feel that the international community\nhas not been swift or decisive enough in taking action to end\nthe calculated brutality in Bosnia and avert the devastation\nof so much that is sacred in that land. We pray for the\nspeediest possible settlement, one that is comprehensive and\nhas realistic prospects for the lasting peace and economic\nprosperity of all concerned. There should be no reward for\naggression.\nThe grim outlook for many troubled areas of the world\nshould not, however, cast a shadow over the hope typified\nby the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord. Cambodia is a high\npoint in peacemaking, and we rejoice in this special\naccomplishment for the people of that ancient country and\nfor the United Nations, as we do in the announcement in this\nAssembly by Nelson Mandela of the imminent demise of\napartheid. South Africa\u2019s move towards a multiracial and\ndemocratic society is the attainment of a dream we have all\nshared for so long. We pray for the peaceful success of the\nannounced general elections in April 1994.\nWe are indeed at a turning-point - a point at which\nwe should now turn to the healing process. We must put\nbehind us the divisiveness and acrimony which have\ncharacterized the debates and the decisions of past years.\nAlmost every speaker in this debate has focused on\npeace-keeping and the unprecedented demands being made\nof the United Nations. Our support of United Nations\npeace-keeping operations is total, as is our acceptance of\npreventive diplomacy as fundamental to \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\". We have no military resources or experience, and\nwe have been able to assist only by way of our assessed\ncontributions. But it is clear to us that failure to provide\nadequate financial and other resources undermines both the\npeace effort and the authority of the United Nations.\nIt seems to be generally acknowledged that, in the\nspace of some two years, the cost of United Nations peace-\nkeeping has quadrupled to a level currently four times larger\nthan the United Nations regular budget. In our humble\nopinion, peace-keeping at such a level cannot possibly be\nsustained without adequate and improved financing and\nfinancial management. Above all, peace-keeping objectives\nand mandates need to be clearly identified and managed.\nThere is everything to be gained by the application of the\nprinciples of accountability, consistency and transparency.\nPeace-keeping at current levels has compounded the\ntragedy of war through the loss of United Nations staff and\npersonnel. In the strongest terms, we condemn the attacks\nand deliberate targeting of United Nations peace-keeping\nforces wherever they occur. We support early and effective\ninternational measures and necessary arrangements within\nthe United Nations system for the full protection of United\nNations personnel and forces, as well as action against those\nwho commit acts of violence against our messengers of\npeace.\nIn all this, the Security Council is the vital link. We\nnow have a proposal before the Assembly to take a closer\nlook at the arrangements and strengthening of the Security\nCouncil. We also acknowledge the useful report the\nSecretary-General has sent us on the various views\nexpressed. Our own concern is for the efficacy and\neffectiveness of the Council. So long as these are assured,\nSamoa would support the required reforms to the Security\nCouncil. But, no doubt, we should all take sufficient time\nto ponder these matters.\nIn the wider aspect, we believe that no amount of force\nand no measure of peace-keeping can sustain peace and\nsecurity without attention to the root causes. The general\nexperience is that human misery, brought about by poverty\nand the denial of human and democratic rights, is the real\nand fundamental problem. We therefore uphold the belief\nexpressed by many leaders from this rostrum that socio-\neconomic development and democratic reforms areessential\nto the prevention of political and social crises. We think this\nshould remain a major preoccupation of the United Nations.\nWe believe deeply in the underlying importance of\nhuman rights in all United Nations activities. In this respect,\nwe welcome the Declaration and Programme of Action\nproduced by the World Conference on Human Rights in\nVienna and the acknowledgement in unquestionable terms of\nthe universality of human rights. The results of the Vienna\nConference constitute a significant advance in the promotion\nand protection of human rights, not least in the recognition\nthat development has a true claim to be considered a human\nright.\nWe agree with and support the proposal to establish a\nUnited Nations high commissioner for human rights. Such\nan office could serve as a strong focal point for coordination\nof the currently fragmented branches of the United Nations\nhuman rights system and could help to ensure that human\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 13\nrights are integrated into the work of all United Nations\nprogrammes.\nThe very basis of human rights is the right of peoples\nto determine their own future and governance. This is\nfundamental, and it is something very close to our hearts,\ngiven our experience and the political evolvement of our\nown State. The South Pacific Forum has continued to call\non the metropolitan countries to take into account the wishes\nof the people in the Territories and to respect their right to\nself-determination.\nWe welcome the ongoing dialogue between France and\nall parties in New Caledonia regarding the future of the\nTerritory. The peaceful evolution towards self-determination\nin New Caledonia is in accordance with the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. Its attainment was made possible by\nthe constructive intervention of the United Nations\ndecolonization Committee and by the willingness of the\nGovernment of France, the parties in New Caledonia and the\nSouth Pacific Forum to show restraint to give full\nconsideration to each other\u2019s concerns and sensitivities.\nWhat we see in New Caledonia today stands as a testament\nto the cooperative spirit characteristic of the Pacific region\nand as a true example of peaceful and preventive diplomacy\nat work.\nAt the same time, we acknowledge and respect the\nviews and interests of those Territories that wish to continue\nwith the status quo.\nPeace, stability, security and the preservation of our\nenvironment are crucial to the South Pacific region. Our\ncommitment to these objectives is unwavering, and Samoa,\ntogether with its regional partners, will continue to call for\na permanent end to nuclear testing, to the dumping of\nchemical and toxic wastes and to the transportation of these\nmaterials in our waters. The South Pacific Forum countries\nhave continued to urge the remaining nuclear-power States\nto heed our concerns and to accede to the Protocols of the\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. That Treaty is the\nparamount symbol of the region\u2019s strong feeling about and\ncommitment to a nuclear-free environment. We are\nencouraged by recent indications from some of these States\nthat they will reconsider their current positions on the Treaty\nand on other nuclear-related issues that are of concern to the\nregion.\nSamoa is particularly pleased about the extension of the\nnuclear-testing moratorium. However, we are deeply\ndistressed to have learned last week of a breach of that\nmoratorium. I have cause to believe that substantial\nnumbers in the Assembly share our concern and our earnest\nprayer that no further tests will be carried out and that other\nnuclear Powers will not resume their nuclear-testing\nprogrammes. It is our dearest hope that such testing will\none day cease - permanently. We also urge all Member States -\nthe nuclear Powers in particular - to work towards the early\nconclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.\nWe welcome the unique opportunity offered by the end\nof the cold war to focus and develop comprehensive-nuclear-\ndisarmament initiatives. We stand ready to do what we can\nin support of these. We should say, however, that the\nprospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and - worse -\nof their acquisition by unfriendly parties is of major concern\nto us, as, of course, to the world community as a whole. It\nunderscores the urgent need for the control, reduction and\neventual elimination of these deadly weapons. The\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, which is a vital part of the\ndisarmament process must be extended indefinitely when it\ncomes up for review in 1995.\nWe look to the nuclear-weapon States to take the lead\nin the nuclear-disarmament process and, at the same time, to\nillustrate with concrete action their full commitment to our\ncollective goals and objectives. The South Pacific region\ncannot continue to be a testing ground for nuclear devices;\nor to be a dumping ground for chemical wastes; or to be\nexposed to contamination by toxic wastes and other\nenvironmentally threatening substances.\nEnvironmental security is crucial to Samoa and other\ncountries of the South Pacific. The United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, held in Rio\nin 1992, provided us with an opportunity to put our global\nhouse in order - an occasion of promise, of rising hopes.\nThe setting of Agenda 21 and the establishment of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development are only first steps.\nImplementation is the difficult task - the true test.\nLike other places, our small island States and low-lying\natolls face a host of constraints. Isolated and ecologically\nfragile, small island States like my own are amongst the\nmost vulnerable to external economic, trade and climatic\nfactors. Without international cooperation, and without an\nintegrated approach, the outlook is not promising.\nThe Global Conference on the Sustainable Development\nof Small Island Developing States - to be held in Barbados\nin April 1994 - will provide a first opportunity to implement\nAgenda 21 and to reaffirm commitments made in Rio. We\nfirmly believe that international attention, focused at next\nyear\u2019s global conference, will provide valuable guidance\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ntowards a sustainable-development effort worldwide. It\nseems to us that if there is failure to secure sustainable\ndevelopment for small island States, there will be no real\nchance of success elsewhere.\nThe work of the Preparatory Committee remains\nincomplete. But the stakes are too high for\ninconclusiveness, so a resumed preparatory session before\nthe Barbados Conference is essential.\nI should say that our call for international cooperation\nis fully matched by our resolve to do what is necessary and\npossible at the domestic level. As a country, we\nacknowledge and accept primary responsibility for our\nenvironment and development. To this end, we have\ncompleted a national environment-management plan, have\nput in place the necessary legislative framework and have\ntaken steps to adhere to the appropriate international\nConventions.\nIn all of this, we have had the fullest cooperation of the\nSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme - an\norganization established by the Pacific region and partner\ncountries to coordinate not only national and regional\nactivities but also the region\u2019s participation in world-wide\ninitiatives on the environment. This underlines our basic\nbelief that the total efforts of all nations, acting responsibly\nand in concert, will be crucial if we are adequately to protect\nour environment and our planet.\nI should note the general satisfaction of my delegation\nwith the world-wide debate, which is now under way, about\nthe future of development - and, thus, about our common\nfuture. The United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment was a special landmark. A few months ago,\ncontrary to predictions, the Vienna World Conference on\nHuman Rights registered important accomplishments. Next\nyear, we shall see the particularly crucial Conference on\nPopulation and Development; thereafter, the Conference on\nwomen, and then the social-development Summit.\nYesterday, we heard Papua New Guinea\u2019s initiative on\nopportunity and participation. We consider this a pertinent\nproposal, and that it is an important element in the overall\neffort to involve citizens and to enhance, in particular, the\neconomies of developing countries.\nThese global conferences and initiatives will map out\nnew priorities and courses of action requiring from States\nand ordinary citizens the highest degree of commitment and\ncooperation. Meantime, we will need to concentrate on\nstrengthening and revitalizing our Organization if we are to\nrespond efficiently and effectively to present and future\npriorities. To this purpose, Samoa supports all remedial\nreforms to the United Nations system to ensure optimum use\nof scarce resources.\nNext year has been declared, by the Assembly, the\nInternational Year of the Family. In two years\u2019 time, the\nUnited Nations will mark its fiftieth anniversary. This gives\nus all reason to move ahead with our work, resolved to\nimprove the condition of our world and the well-being of\nour global family.\n"

        "file_text": "I have the honour of speaking on behalf of the European\nCommunity and its member States.\nAllow me, first of all, Mr. President, to pay a tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, who conducted the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s proceedings during its forty-seventh\nsession.\nThe Assembly has unanimously decided to entrust to\nyou, Sir, the conduct of this the forty-eighth session. We\nwelcome that decision as we are familiar with your personal\nqualities and your professional experience. We also see this\nas a well-earned tribute to your country, the Republic of\nGuyana, and to the contribution made by the Caribbean\nregion to the activities of our Organization. The European\nCommunity and its member States, which continue to enjoy\nfruitful relations with the countries of the Caribbean, within\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe dynamic framework of the Lom\u00e9 Convention, assure you\nof their fullest cooperation.\nWe welcome also the admission to our Organization of\nthe Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, the\nPrincipality of Monaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and the Principality of Andorra.\nIn his address to the Assembly last year, my British\ncolleague, Mr. Douglas Hurd, made the point that, after a\nbrief interlude of optimism, the world had entered a period\nof instability and of challenges to law and order. This trend\nhas increased over the past 12 months. We now have to\ncope with new crisis situations, while - speaking only about\nEurope - a just and lasting solution to such a long-standing\nproblem as that of Cyprus has yet to be found, despite the\ncontinued efforts of our Organization.\nLong restrained by the so-called balance of terror, latent\nantagonisms have resurfaced in the Balkans, the Caucasus\nand Central Asia. The collapse of the old institutional\nframeworks has led to the emergence of forms of rapidly\ncompeting nationalisms. The personal ambitions of certain\nrulers and the propaganda machines they control have\nplunged clans or whole peoples into conflicts marked by the\nblind use of violence. In that process, the basic rights of the\nindividual and the elementary rules of international\nhumanitarian law have been constantly flouted.\nIn other countries, the economic and social crisis has\ncontinued to provide fertile ground for religious\nfundamentalism, enabling it to increase the number both of\nits followers and of its victims. Elsewhere, the existence of\na large immigrant population has served as a pretext for\nreactions of racial intolerance, which have even led to\ndeliberate criminal acts. All these forms of fanaticism\ndesignate human beings as the enemy to be destroyed. They\nmust be fought not only through political declarations and\nlaws but also through a more sincere and committed\nengagement in favour of the human values which should\nunite us all across continents and cultures.\nThe proliferation of these situations has gone hand in\nhand with a growing desire to possess weapons of mass\ndestruction. In this connection, we are concerned by the\nactions of Member States of our Organization which have\nample resources, bear regional responsibilities and claim to\nbe lovers of peace. The proliferation of these weapons\nrepresents a grave threat to both global and regional security\nand stability. It is of the utmost importance that the Non-\nProliferation Treaty should be unconditionally extended in\n1995 for an indefinite period.\nEconomic underdevelopment and the unacceptable\nliving conditions of hundreds of millions of inhabitants of\nthe planet constitute another major concern for the European\nCommunity and its member States.\nThe outcome of three decades of development\ncooperation cannot be regarded as positive. This means that\nall of us, countries of the South and of the North, must take\nserious stock of the situation. We know that it is pointless\nto speak of peace in the world if we do not at the same time\nwork towards global economic and social development. The\nforthcoming world conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen and\nBeijing will be important landmarks in this process.\nOur concerns have not blinded us to the important\nefforts undertaken in all regions of the world towards\ndemocratization and economic recovery.\nThe Republics which made up the former Soviet Union\nhave pursued the immense task of creating a political,\neconomic and social framework designed to strengthen their\nsense of identity as individual nations. We must help these\ncountries find ways of achieving deep-rooted national\nreconciliation while fully respecting each other\u2019s territorial\nintegrity. The European Community and its member States\nwill continue to support them substantially through technical\nassistance and partnership agreements. They will also\nmaintain their trade with the countries of Central and Eastern\nEurope, in particular through new or strengthened association\nagreements.\nThe European Community and its member States\nsupport President Yeltsin in his efforts to promote economic\nand political reform as well as to strengthen democracy in\nhis country.\nIt is in Africa that the gap between objectives and\nrealities remains most discouraging. Two hundred million\npeople across that continent live in abject poverty. However,\nin spite of armed conflicts and acute economic problems,\nthere are undeniable signs of the dawn of a new political era.\nIt is of course up to the African people to determine the\npace and practical form of their democratic development.\nSome dictators, however, are still clinging to the power they\nhave long exercised for their own exclusive benefit. Their\narmies, for whose services they somehow manage to pay, are\nlike a weapon permanently aimed at their own people.\nDespite appearances, they are now no more than an\nanachronistic element of underdevelopment.\nSouth Africa is approaching the historic moment when\nthe democratic majority of its people will accede to power.\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 11\nThe path leading to this has, alas, been littered with further\nmassacres and attacks. The European Community and its\nmember States reiterate their support for the negotiating\nprocess pursued by President Frederik De Klerk and Mr.\nNelson Mandela and appeal to the international community\nto assist South Africa in this crucial phase by helping to\norganize elections and to rebuild and develop the country.\nIn Asia, the positive trend of the past few years has\nbeen maintained. On the economic front, the Asian\ncountries of the Pacific Rim, particularly China, are\ncharacterized by remarkable dynamism. The European\nCommunity and its member States hope that this progress\nwill swiftly bear positive results for the living and working\nconditions of their populations.\nLatin America is a continent at peace, continuing its\neconomic recovery in accordance with the objectives of\ndemocratically elected Governments. In several of these\ncountries, rapid population growth, social imbalances and\ndrug-trafficking are, however, still a considerable handicap\nin the march towards progress.\nMore attention has been paid by the authorities to the\nindigenous peoples, but certain tragic events have occurred\nto remind us of the precarious conditions in which those\npeoples live.\nThe European Community and its member States\nwelcome the substantially improved prospects for peace and\nstability in the Middle East. They hope that following the\nrecent Israeli-Palestinian agreements new decisive steps will\nbe taken by Israel and the Arab countries directly concerned\nin the Middle East peace process. The recent\nIsraeli-Jordanian declaration of principles is a positive move\nin this direction. We call upon this Assembly to take\naccount of these major developments when considering the\nsituation in the Middle East.\nThe European Community and its member States, in\nkeeping with their long-standing position, stand ready to\nassume, in close coordination with the competent\ninternational institutions, an important part in the general\ncoordination of the assistance offered by the international\ncommunity to the Palestinian people in the occupied\nterritories. In this connection donor countries will, above all,\nhave to be guided by criteria of efficiency and speed.\nDuring this difficult period the United Nations has not\nbeen merely a passive onlooker.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights made it\npossible to adopt a Final Declaration which reaffirms and\nenriches the universal consensus on the essential respect due\nin all circumstances to the human person. The Vienna\nProgramme of Action provides for a large number of\nmeasures to ensure greater respect for, and promotion of,\nsuch rights throughout the world. The European Community\nand its member States will endeavour, from the present\nsession, to achieve application of these measures, in\nparticular as regards increased resources for the Centre for\nHuman Rights and the appointment of a United Nations high\ncommissioner for human rights.\nActive preparations have continued for other world\nconferences, on population, social development and the\npromotion of women. The follow-up to Rio was ensured by\nthe first meeting of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, which, from the outset, established a relation\nof partnership, which we consider to be highly promising.\nThe \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has been discussed in various\nbodies. The warm welcome it has received has been\nfollowed by various practical measures of implementation.\nWe would, however, like our Assembly to show more\nwillingness to abandon its reservations regarding certain\ntypes of preventive action which have already been adopted\nin practice by the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General.\nThe Organization itself has embarked on and made\nprogress with a series of restructuring measures. The most\ncomplex is probably the restructuring of the Security\nCouncil, but it is encouraging that this topic is now the\nsubject of open dialogue.\nPending a reform which would not compromise its\nefficiency, the Council has kept up the pace of its activities.\nIt has given a larger place in practice to the concepts of\npreventive diplomacy and cooperation with regional\norganizations. The Secretary-General has resolutely backed\nthis trend both through his numerous visits on the ground or\nthose of his personal representatives and through the\nadjustments he has made within the Secretariat. These have\nfocused particularly on strengthening the departments\nresponsible for managing peace-keeping operations. The\nindispensable extension of these services has not yet been\ncompleted and will require further assistance from the\nMember States. Indeed, there has been an overwhelming\nincrease in the United Nations operations in this area over\nthe last few years. They have not simply multiplied: their\nobjectives have also diversified. In several cases, the\ntraditional task of peace-keeping has had to be supplemented\n12 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nor, initially, replaced by the much more delicate task of\nrestoring peace.\nThe Organization has, in the eyes of some, met with\nfailure in the very difficult situations with which it has had\nto cope in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. The\nduplicity of some warlords constitutes a permanent threat of\ndestabilization.\nBut, in no circumstances has the international\ncommunity chosen to combine humanitarian-aid missions\nwith peace-restoring missions. The use of force has been\nseen only as a last resort in order to come to the help of\npeople held hostage by self-proclaimed leaders. Our\nOrganization has consequently been constrained to use,\nunder certain circumstances, means corresponding to the\nprovocations it has had to face. We must, however, draw\nlessons from the experience acquired through these various\noperations.\nThe breadth and complexity of humanitarian crises\nthroughout the world also require greater coordination of\nhumanitarian assistance both during strategic planning of\noperations and during their implementation on the ground.\nThe spirit of perseverance, in compliance with the\nCharter and human rights, is more necessary than ever. It\nenabled Cambodia to implement the Paris Agreements in\nconditions which proved to be very difficult - as indeed they\nhad promised to be. This represents a great victory for the\nCambodian people as well as a remarkable success for the\nUnited Nations, and was achieved through unprecedented\neffort: by numerous Governments, by thousands of officials\nand volunteers, and also by large numbers of soldiers,\ndozens of whom sacrificed their lives. The European\nCommunity and its member States pay tribute to the \\\"Blue\nHelmets\\\" who, frequently killed in cold blood, have been\nvictims of their duty throughout the world. Their safety, as\nwell as that of all United Nations staff, must be improved\nand the pursuit of their aggressors must be organized more\neffectively.\nThe European Community and its member States are\nalso convinced of the need to react to the consequences of\nthe presence of mines resulting from armed conflicts. These\ndevices claim numerous victims every year amongst the\ncivilian population and jeopardize the rehabilitation of vast\nareas of territory ravaged by war. We ask this Assembly to\nconsider the draft resolution which we have submitted on\nthis subject with a view to a more systematic and effective\norganization of assistance in mine-clearing. We also\nwelcome the French initiative of asking the United Nations\nSecretary-General to convene a conference to review the\n1981 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use\nof Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed\nto Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate\nEffects.\nThus, the overall picture of activities by the United\nNations and its Members during the last 12 months is far\nfrom disappointing, and I could have listed many other\npositive developments. However, when we consider the\ndifficulties facing us, it is hard to claim categorically that,\nwhatever happens, the United Nations will be able to meet\nthe challenges of the future effectively.\nThe Secretariat\u2019s capacities are being used to the full;\nthey are no longer sufficient to deal with Member States\u2019\nwishes in every case. The Organization\u2019s coffers are empty\nor virtually so. The development of new activities is\nhampered more and more often by disagreements about the\nallocation of costs. Most of the major contributors, who are\nseriously affected in their own countries by an unfavourable\neconomic situation, regard strict budgetary restraint as more\nimportant than ever. The cost of peace-keeping operations\nalone will be $3.6 billion for 1993.\nIn addition to the immediate cash-flow problems, there\nis an increasing structural deficit in the balance between the\nability to take multilateral action and ever-increasing requests\nfor intervention. What can we do to ensure that the United\nNations does not fall victim to its own success? We feel\nthat finding a solution entails three areas of action.\nFirst, of course, all Member States must pay their\ncontributions fully and in a timely manner. That is a\nfundamental obligation with which the European Community\nand its member States never fail to comply. The effort this\nrequires is neither more nor less than that demanded of other\ncontributors, be they \\\"big\\\" or \\\"small\\\", for each Member\nState is required to make a contribution in line with its\nability to pay. Failure to pay represents a serious breach of\nthe commitments entered into, and it is all the more\nregrettable that certain defaulting countries at the same time\nlay claim to a privileged role in the Organization\u2019s debates\nand decisions.\nSecondly, the various reforms undertaken in order to\nimprove the operational efficiency of the Organization have\nto be pursued with a maximum of determination. We have\nin mind in particular the management of the Secretariat, the\ncontrol of its expenditures and the forthcoming restructuring\nin the economic and social sector. It is unacceptable that the\nobjectives set could not be met owing to interminable\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 13\nnegotiations or power struggles between senior\nadministrators.\nThirdly, although the United Nations remains an\nintergovernmental body, it is called upon more and more\nfrequently to fulfil a central government task, with\nresponsibility for solving each and every problem that may\narise.\nIn order to cope with this growing tide of demands, the\nSecretary-General in his \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\" has quite\nrightly stressed the need for cooperation with regional\norganizations and arrangements.\nBut are they ready? Do they exist everywhere? Does\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations\nand regional organizations offer real prospects if the latter do\nnot become effective centres of decision and action? We\nfeel that, without the capacity for swift and ongoing\nintervention on a regional scale, preventive diplomacy by our\nOrganization is a resource which is undoubtedly\nindispensable but of limited scope. It will indeed facilitate\nsuccesses here and there, but will be insufficient to come to\ngrips with the most deep-rooted and most threatening\nantagonisms. If nothing changes, the danger of entire\ncountries imploding is real. The situation will channel\nmultilateral resources more and more into makeshift rescue\nand rehabilitation operations, to the detriment of collective\nsustainable development objectives.\nIn this connection the positive effects of an area of\nstability such as the European Community no longer need to\nbe demonstrated. The European Community was inspired at\nthe start by a profound desire for peacemaking and\nreconstruction. The same needs and aspirations are to be\nfound elsewhere in the world but have not been matched by\na comparable response.\nWe believe that there is no alternative to the\nestablishment of such areas in every continent. The resolute\npursuit of regional economic integration is a decisive and\nindispensable step in that direction. The benefits of\neconomies of scale and the free movement of persons and\ngoods then contribute as much to consolidating peace as to\nsharing prosperity. By uniting to form centres of stability\nand progress, the participating countries gradually free\nthemselves of the mounting problems and crises which, at\nthis time of tremendous change, tend to be more than they\ncan cope with on their own.\nIn addition to these areas of stability, it is also\nnecessary to create or strengthen broader regional\nmechanisms, making it possible for a number of subregions\nto develop principles of peaceful and prosperous coexistence.\nHere, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\ncan serve, if not as a universal model, at least as a source of\ninspiration. Even if its ability to intervene directly is\nlimited, it constitutes an indispensable platform for dialogue.\nWhen internal or bilateral crises occur, it encourages the\nneighbouring countries to show moderation and thus\ncontributes to limiting the conflict. As respect for common\nrules grows, more concrete collective actions can be\nenvisaged.\nThese are the essential tools for achieving the threefold\nobjective which the Secretary-General recommends in his\nlatest report on the activities of the Organization: peace,\ndevelopment and democracy.\nAlready 32 years ago, a young Egyptian jurist declared\nat the Academy of International Law:\n\\\"To encourage assemblies of States in a world that\nis becoming more and more Balkanized, to play\nthe role of bringing peoples together and to offer\nmassive and constant aid to underdeveloped\ncountries: these should be the primary objectives\nof the international organization.\\\" (Recueil des\ncours, Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International, La Haye,\n1960, II, pp. 69-70)\nThis jurist is today at the head of our Organization.\nTo be sure, in all continents regional bodies have\nalready embarked on this course of action: in the past year\nthey have contributed, in cooperation with the United\nNations, to crucial mediation and peace-keeping ventures -\nbut always after the conflict had flared up. Areas of genuine\nstability and more reliable regional mechanisms would make\nit possible to forestall major crises by reducing their causes.\nRegional integration indeed can only help contain the\ncollective frustrations and anxieties that fuel nationalist\nmovements. It also provides a formidable incentive for\neconomic growth and therefore a strategic element in\ncombating poverty. Finally, regional economic integration,\nas it is progressively being built, simply eliminates the\noption of war from the thinking of the Governments and\npeoples involved.\nThe disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and its\ntragic consequences make it all too clear that the comments\nwe have just made relate to a course of action that will\nprove long and demanding rather than a miracle cure.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNeither the European Community nor the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe has been able to prevent\nthe outbreak of the conflict and the subsequent series of\ndisasters. Like the United Nations and the United States of\nAmerica, the European Community and its member States\nhave consequently been accused of lacking strategy and of\nindifference. For the European Community and its\nmembers, one of the lessons to be learned from this\ncatastrophe is that the deepening of its own internal relations\n- more Europe rather than less Europe - would strengthen\nthe role it must play as an instrument for promoting stability\nand peace in Europe and neighbouring areas.\nNo one can dispute, however, the fact that the European\nCommunity and its member States have endeavoured to\nmediate from the earliest days of the conflict. It was the\nmembers of the European Community who, going against\nthe current, managed to persuade the whole Security Council\nto react to the worsening situation. Without compromising\ntheir positions of principle, and despite numerous\ndisappointments, the member States of the Community have\nat no point wearied of their thankless task.\nThe efforts deployed at the London and Geneva\nConferences bear witness to this. As you are aware, the\nEuropean Community and its member States have played a\nfundamental role on the ground, particularly through the\nactivities of their monitors, in the implementation of\nsanctions and through their contribution to the United\nNations Protection Force and to measures to help the victims\nof the civil war.\nThe European Community and its member States also\nreiterate their readiness to participate in the implementation\nof a peace plan accepted by all the parties.\nThe Treaty of Maastricht on the European Union should\nprovide us with the means of strengthening the Union\u2019s\nability to act in the world, in particular by implementing the\ncommon foreign and security policy. Once it has entered\ninto force - which should happen in the next few days - that\nTreaty will enable the European Union to play an enhanced\nrole in all areas of international policy and security and will\nestablish close working relations between the European\nUnion and the Western European Union. Moreover, the\nimminent enlargement of the European Union to include new\nmembers will simply increase its ability to exercise a\nstabilizing influence over adjacent countries.\nThe enlargement of the European Union and its\nreadiness to conclude association and cooperation agreements\nof ever wider scope with virtually all regions and countries\nof the globe are proof of our sincere desire to forge ahead\nwith the building of Europe while at the same time opening\nEurope to the world. This is the kind of Europe that is\nproving increasingly able to serve the objectives of the\nCharter. It provides encouragement to other countries and\nregions to unite, to join together, as Europe has done, in the\ncommon task of achieving greater peace in tomorrow\u2019s\nworld.\n"

        "file_text": " More than 12 months ago,\naddressing the Assembly, which since then has seen a steady\nincrease in its membership, with the admission of new\nMembers that I welcome today with great pleasure, I\nexpressed my personal satisfaction and that of the people of\nthe Republic of San Marino over the momentous changes\nthat have marked these past hectic years.\nToday, however, we face the pressing and serious\nproblem of managing those changes. It is of fundamental\nimportance to those peoples who have seen the laying of the\nfoundations of the edifice called \\\"Democracy\\\" that this\nprocess continue and be shored up by solid institutions. The\nstrengthening of those institutions must be accomplished to\nguarantee the solidity of that essential edifice, which may be\naltered or changed in some of its parts, but which cannot be\ndeprived of its foundations.\nToday more than ever, the importance of democratic\ninstitutions must be acknowledged, upheld and stressed.\nNow more than ever, peoples need to be assured that\nstruggles for power, those between factions and those caused\nby ethnic, economic and political interests, will be averted\nfor ever so that real peace may be made, restored and\nmaintained.\nMy country is convinced that a renewed commitment\nof the United Nations is necessary for the attainment of this\naim, in virtue of the role it plays as a universal factor that\nhas become a real point of reference for the entire world.\nNot even the most advanced democratic society can\nfully meet the needs arising out of the exercise of freedom.\nIn my opinion, however, any form of political regime other\nthan democracy would deprive man of his freedom to an\neven greater degree. Democracy, even in its initial and most\nincomplete forms, is organized in such a way that\nindividuals may take part, directly or indirectly, in the\nexercise of power.\nFurther development of the existing democratic r\u00e9gime\nis a precise commitment that my country has undertaken in\nan attempt to find a solution to one of the consequences of\nthe past emigration of its citizens. I am referring to the\nefforts we are making to facilitate the exercise of their right\nand duty to participate in political life through their votes.\nIn our attempts to solve this problem the relevant\ninternational instruments of the United Nations will be a\nprecise point of reference and an irreplaceable guide.\nI am following with particular interest the discussion\nunder way on the possibility of reforming the institutional\nmechanisms of the Organization. It is undoubtedly wise to\nadapt institutions to present circumstances, so that they will\nrespond effectively to the new challenges. San Marino\nsupports those reforms, prompted by the conviction that\nwider participation leads to more effective and shared\ninterventions. That is why with my country is following\nwith special attention the application submitted by Sweden,\nin its capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), for the CSCE\u2019s\nadmission to the United Nations with Observer States. That\napplication enjoys the full support of all participating States,\nand I wish to express here the desire of my country to see\nit accepted.\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe CSCE continues to play a leading role in Europe\nin favour of peace and the safeguarding of human rights.\nCloser cooperation with the United Nations has now become\nindispensable, and it will surely produce positive results.\nThe initial task of the United Nations was to lay down\nthe fundamental principles for the protection of human\ndignity and for a peaceful, democratic and civil coexistence.\nIt then undertook a wider-ranging task, in light of the\nevolution of rights and of those systems established for their\nsafeguard. Now the Organization must intensify its\nintervention straightforwardly and incisively in order to\nresolve critical situations.\nThe policy of pursuing the peaceful solution, resorting\nto negotiations, mediation and political diplomatic initiatives,\nis unquestionably the right course. That is the path to follow\nin our times; it is policy of a democratic society in which\nreason must always prevail.\nRecourse to force, even when it seems indispensable to\nmaintain or restore democracy, is always an unfair and\ndangerous option, since it takes a heavy toll of lives and\ncreates grounds for revenge that are risky and difficult to\ndispel and may always trigger civil wars.\nI truly hope we will not have to say one day that the\nmagic moment when our dreams seemed to have become\nreality has passed us by. We must persist in averting the\ndangerous strategy of nuclear deterrence.\nIf we manage to create a world with collective security\nas its prevailing feature, there will no longer be grounds for\nconflicts. Peace, however, does not depend exclusively on\nthe possession of weapons and on the thirst for supremacy.\nToday, more than ever, peace depends on solidarity, on\nrespect for rights and on our efforts in favour of tolerance.\nEurope is plagued by conflicts that offend peoples,\nminorities, women, children and the poor. Every continent\nis afflicted by wars and deep crises, which have become so\nendemic as to arouse the suspicion that they have been\naccepted as the norm. Some of the conflicts have become\nso acute that even humane acts, solidarity and the most\nindispensable interventions against hunger and cold seem\nnow to have faded into the background.\nExhausting and sincere mediation initiatives fail; crisis-\nmanagement becomes impossible; the solution of conflicts\nseems unattainable, despite the growing number of political,\ndiplomatic and military missions, and even relief missions\nare hindered in the performance of their work.\nSan Marino believes that the United Nations has the\nability, the authority and the structures to formulate a\ndynamic and effective plan able to prevent and solve\nconflicts, manage crises and maintain peace.\nThe authority and the means of the Organization may\nsometimes not involve military choices. In any case, such\ninterventions can be justified only when all possibilities of\na peaceful solution have been considered and it is borne in\nmind that resort to this option must not cause victims.\nCrises and conflicts may be averted by eliminating their\nroot causes. When riches are not fairly distributed; when all\ncitizens do not enjoy the same rights and duties; when rights\nand freedoms are not respected; when it is forgotten that\nminorities are composed of individuals; when a distinction\nis made between the dignity of man and that of woman;\nwhen injustice exists; when man and his rights do not prevail\nover the organization of the State and its military apparatus;\nthen conflicts inevitably arise.\nThe key principle of the United Nations, which has\nalways fascinated the people of the Republic of San Marino\nand has now become our trusted point of reference, is that\nof the indissoluble bond between personal freedom and the\nliberty of all peoples. That freedom must be based on a\ncomplex system of limits so that no man, in the exercise of\nhis rights, can ride roughshod over the rights of another.\nIn that spirit the Republic of San Marino recently\nwelcomed with sincere satisfaction the agreement of mutual\nrecognition signed by the State of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO). That agreement, concerning\nan area that has been theatre of war for a very long time,\nwas reached through peaceful negotiations and political\nmediation in which both sides gave up something to\nfacilitate the peace process.\nThis major event is an important point of reference, a\nproof of the existing good will and wish for certainty,\nconfirming that this is the only possible way to resolve\nconflicts.\nMy country is convinced that many challenges have yet\nto be met and still await effective solutions. We have to\nexert our best endeavours to defend the poor from\nunderdevelopment, to sustain and contribute to their progress\nby restoring to them, when the situation so requires, the\nenvironment of which they have been deprived as a\nconsequence of ecological degradation. Every man is a\nguardian of the world and is entitled to ask that it be used\ncorrectly.\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 15\nWe must express solidarity in the forms that such a\nhumanitarian and understanding attitude requires, respecting\nthe dignity of peoples and their freedom to make their own\nchoices and determine their own destinies.\nWe must play a fundamental role in educating future\ngenerations on mutual understanding, respect and tolerance.\nThis is the challenge facing the entire world and Europe in\nparticular. Together we will have to overcome the\nconsequences of intolerance to which we have given the\nnames of racism, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\", mass migrations, refuge\nand asylum.\nThe people of San Marino are following with particular\nconcern all issues related to minorities, their inalienable right\nto free existence and well-balanced development, respect for\ntheir cultures and religions, and the real exercise of these\nrights under the same conditions enjoyed by the majorities.\nThe reason for this special interest is probably to be found\nin the numerically small population of my country, which\nhistory has always taught to offer hospitality and express\nsolidarity with the weak, the oppressed and the victims of\npersecution.\nToday this problem has reached proportions that might\nbecome alarming. Nobody knows how many people may\nbe forced in the future to leave their native countries in\norder to survive, whether in flight from underdevelopment\nand hunger or prompted by the desire for freedom. Thus,\nthe problem has two faces. The first is the fact that no one\nshould be forced to leave his home and country; the second\nis the fact that all people, to the extent their circumstances\npermit, must be willing to offer hospitality in a spirit of\nsolidarity and brotherhood.\nHaving referred to this problem, I cannot fail to\nmention the situation affecting the former Yugoslavia, the\ncoast of which can be seen, when the air is clear, from the\nmountain on which the Republic of San Marino is situated.\nWho knows the destiny of that poor people or when this\nunacceptable war will finally end? I appeal to the General\nAssembly, to all States of the world and to the United\nNations that we put a halt to the catastrophe. Let us\nreiterate and strengthen within our own nations a sense of\ntolerance undertaken as a duty and not as a right.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the speakers who have preceded me\nat this prestigious rostrum have all unanimously\nacknowledged your outstanding intellectual qualities, your\nwealth of experience and your intensive knowledge of\ninternational issues which will guarantee a positive outcome\nto our work that promises to be very exciting at this time\nwhen we see emerging on the horizon the irreversible\nturning of the activities of the Organization towards real,\nmutually beneficial, cooperation.\nThe delegation of the Republic of Zaire, which it is my\nhonour to head, associates itself with the congratulations and\nwishes expressed by other delegations here present and\nexpresses the hope that your presidency will see the essential\nbasis laid down for the establishment of this new era of\npeace, prosperity, mutual understanding and tolerance that\nwe all so wish to see.\nI should also like to extend my sincere congratulations\nto the other members of the Bureau who, I am sure, will\neffectively assist you in carrying out your onerous but\ninspiring tasks as President.\nTo your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev,\nI should like to pay a particular and well-deserved tribute for\nthe competence, skill and know-how with which he so\ncapably guided the work of the General Assembly at its\nforty-seventh session.\nI should like to express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization, the sincere\nexpression of our appreciation and our encouragement of his\ndetermination in the search for peaceful solutions to the\nmany armed conflicts that are devastating the world.\nI should also like to welcome to the Organization the\nnew Member States. They can count on the cooperation and\nassistance, both bilateral and multilateral, of the Republic of\nZaire.\nBarely three years ago the overwhelming majority of\nthe inhabitants of this marvelous planet Earth were filled\nwith the hope of seeing close and multifaceted cooperation\nfor development among nations.\n\nAlthough the cold war was blown away by the force of\nthe wind of perestroika we are obliged to note that this\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly has opened at\na time when we are witnessing the resumption of armed\nconflicts in at least three of the five continents which make\nup this world.\nThe collapse of the socialist bloc brought with it only\na moment of calm for we note at present the explosion of\nhotbeds of tension and fratricidal wars in the former Union\nof Soviet Socialist Republics and the former Yugoslavia, and\nwe condemn the monstrous, inhuman and horrendous acts of\nmodern civilization there.\nThe primary cause of all these wars is religious or\nethnic intolerance and the non-acceptance of political\nopinions contrary to those which one believes to be of\nimmutable and subject to imposition on all. Thus, in Asia\nanachronistic situations persist and entire populations are\ncondemned to wander without any hope of a better\ntomorrow.\nNevertheless, my delegation backs the negotiations that\nare now taking place between Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO) on the question of Palestine\nand urges all the protagonists in this drama to do all in their\npower to ensure that these consultations lead to the\nconclusion of a peace agreement guaranteeing the right of\neach people to exist in internationally recognized territory.\nWe hail the courage and determination of their\nexcellencies the Prime Minister of Israel and the President\nof the PLO who have recognized autonomy for Gaza and\nJericho and have also committed themselves to put an end\nto acts of piracy and sabotage. May their example be\nfollowed by other States involved in this conflict so that a\nlasting peace can finally be established in this region and\nthat we can see genuine cooperation for development.\nSo too, we reaffirm our full support and our backing\nfor the efforts made by the two Koreas towards their\npeaceful reunification.\nWe should also like to take advantage of this\nopportunity to congratulate the United Nations authorities\nwhich have effectively contributed to the organization of free\nand democratic elections in Cambodia.\nAs regards Africa, this continent too has not been\nspared by the situation of semi-war, semi-peace in which\nyoung States must manage bloody conflicts which sorely try\ntheir fragile State structures and their precarious socio-\neconomic infrastructures. However, the Republic of Zaire is\ngratified to see the international community mobilizing to\nprevent new conflicts and to find peaceful solutions to those\nfratricidal wars which are devastating a good number of\nAfrican States.\nThe plethora of hotbeds of tension and the recourse to\nmilitary action, whether for intervention or for pacification,\nare likely to wipe out these efforts and to damage the\nhumanitarian action and the noble objectives of peace and\nharmony pursued by the United Nations.\nConcerning southern Africa, in particular, Zaire\nsupports the action being taken by the United Nations in\nMozambique, and urges all the parties to the conflict to\nrespect the commitments they have undertaken and to work\ntowards the establishment of lasting peace there.\nThe positive results that we have seen in South Africa,\nwhere the white minority has agreed to involve the black\nmajority in the administration of public affairs in a\nTransitional Executive Council, are grounds for satisfaction\nfor all those who have contributed towards them, and for\nlegitimate pride for Presidents Mandela and De Klerk.\nGiven these prospects for peace that we can see just\nover the horizon, it is our keen hope that there will be\ngenuine reconciliation within the black community in South\nAfrica so that a fratricidal war does not break out that would\nquite likely support the notions of those who wish to hold\nback the advent of a democratic and multi-racial Republic of\nSouth Africa.\nI beg the Assembly\u2019s indulgence, since I should like\nnow to dwell on the case of our neighbour Angola, which\nshares with Zaire a frontier over 2,600 kilometres long; in\nAngola, the civil war, which is becoming more intense, is\ncausing considerable loss of life and incalculable material\ndamage and is threatening the territorial integrity of that\nyoung nation.\nThe Republic of Zaire, which, since it acceded to\nindependence, has had to suffer the throes of civil war,\nrebellion and many attempts at secession, cannot afford to\nsupport a civil war in Angola. The tragic situation being\nexperienced by that fraternal nation is of extreme concern to\nus, because it is causing us enormous political, economic\nand social problems. Zaire is actually a semi-landlocked\ncountry, and the closure of the Benguela railway and the\ncontinuing insecurity right alongside Matadi port, our only\noutlet to the sea - as a result of the crossfire between the\nPopular Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola\n(FAPLA) and UNITA - are doing my country considerable\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3\neconomic damage right at a moment when it is no longer\nreceiving bilateral or multilateral assistance.\nIn addition to these many economic difficulties, there\nhas been a massive influx of our Angolan brothers and\nsisters, who are finding refuge with Zairian families, to\nwhich they are linked by historical ties of blood. Providing\nfood, shelter and so on for the refugees is increasing the\ndifficulties being experienced by the host families, who are\nthemselves rather disadvantaged.\nThe international community knows that the Republic\nof Zaire right now is going through a period of political\nturbulence and is encountering enormous economic and\nfinancial difficulties. In these conditions, where could Zaire\nfind the additional resources to finance a civil war in\nAngola? Taking into account its internal problems, my\ncountry has no interest in promoting the traffic in weapons\nof war through Matadi port, given that they could change\nhands and fuel a civil war on its own territory.\nMoreover, Zaire, which neither makes nor sells arms,\ndeplores the attitude of those countries whose citizens\nmanufacture arms and sell them to the belligerents - under\nthe tolerant gaze of their Governments - and then come and\nshed crocodile tears in international forums over the fate of\nthe victims of this fratricidal war.\nThe Republic of Zaire, which assisted the Republic of\nAngola in its struggle for independence and, through Zaire\u2019s\nmediation, facilitated the historic meeting between President\ndos Santos and Mr. Savimbi at Gbadolite, is still ready to\nseek, with them, ways and means of putting an end to the\nAngolan tragedy. This is the spirit in which Zaire welcomed\nMr. Alioune Blondin Beye, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative, on his visit to Kinshasa last September, and\nin which the President of the Republic of Zaire, Marshal\nMobutu Sese Seko, dispatched to his Angolan counterpart an\nemissary whose task was to dispel any ambiguity as to\nwhether there was meddling of any kind by my country in\nAngola\u2019s internal affairs.\nLastly, the Republic of Zaire, which has played an\nactive part at the recent Libreville conference on security\nproblems in central Africa and will soon sign the non-\naggression pact that was drawn up there, considers itself an\nimportant link in the peace and security of the subregion,\nand does not intend to take any action that might sour the\nrelations of good neighbourliness and cooperation that exist\nbetween our States. Ancient African wisdom tells us that\nwhen your neighbour\u2019s house is on fire, you must help him\nput it out in order to stop the wind wafting the flames\ntowards your own house.\nAfter the political turbulence that Africa experienced\nduring the first few years of independence, some political\nthinkers and players believed, in good faith, that establishing\nstrong government based on omnipresent and omnipotent\nsingle parties could forge national unity and ensure our\nStates\u2019 harmonious development. The Republic of Zaire was\nno exception to this outline. In fact, for over two decades\nnow a monolithic political system has been in operation,\nwith its ups and downs, and has ended up, as a result of its\nown internal contradictions, in such deadlock that on\n24 April 1990 the President of the Republic, after three\nmonths of consultations of the people, decreed the\ndissolution of the single party and proposed the introduction\nof a pluralistic political system.\nUnfortunately, the enthusiasm that followed gave birth\nto a sort of collective outpouring and the frenzied\nestablishment of political parties, of which there are now\n360 for a total population of 40 million or so. In our\nconcern to make an objective reassessment of our history,\nmap out our future and ensure national reconciliation, we\nheld a Sovereign National Conference, which, lasting over\n16 months, was the costliest and the longest in Africa.\nThe Conference raised great hopes but was unable to\nachieve all its goals because, from the outset, those behind\nit had come to it for two different reasons. For some, the\nConference was the best place to take power along\nrevolutionary-type lines - dissolving all the existing\ninstitutions and sidelining those in charge of them - while\nfor others, who championed a reformist type of plan, the\nConference ought rather to be the place for organizing\ngovernment through a progressive restructuring of the\ninstitutions. This basic difference caused heightened\npassions from the beginning to the end of the Conference,\nand the political players ended up more divided than they\nhad been before.\nAs the document setting out constitutional provisions\nfor the transitional period was not taken to its logical\nconclusion - it failed to abrogate expressly the Constitution\nin force - the country found itself with two basic\nconstitutional texts. In conditions such as these, it has been\ndifficult to arrange an equitable sharing of power between\nthe various transitional institutions, which is why we have an\ninstitutional crisis and a political impasse.\nTo extricate ourselves from this situation, and on the\ninitiative of the President of the Republic and the President\nof the Supreme Council of the Republic, the delegates of\nseveral political platforms met in caucus to create a new\ninstitutional framework. But the results of the caucus were\nagain disputed and the entire political class felt the need to\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nresume negotiations. These achieved, inter alia, the\nestablishment of a new institutional framework, the\nunanimous acceptance of a timetable establishing the various\ndates for elections in the next 15 months and the adoption by\nreferendum, within the same period, of a new constitution.\nThus, a referendum will be held in 1994 on the\nadoption of the new constitution. There will also be free,\ntransparent and democratic elections for mandates for the\npresidency of the Republic, the Parliament and the regional\nand local councils. The presence of an independent national\nelectoral commission and international observers is planned\nto reassure all sides of the proper carrying out of all\nelectoral operations. Thus, Zaire repeats its request to the\nUnited Nations bodies and countries with a long history of\ndemocracy for substantial help in the implementation of\nthese important timetables.\nI should like here, on behalf of the Government of my\ncountry, to thank Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\nGeneral of our universal Organization, who, at the request of\nthe President of the Republic, sent one of his closest\nassistants, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to Kinshasa to try to gather\nthe political class of Zaire around the negotiating table. We\nextend to him here the deep gratitude of the people of Zaire\nfor his selflessness and readiness in his attempt to reconcile\nthe sons and daughters of my country.\nIn an atmosphere of political crisis and social tension,\nthe protection of human rights becomes very difficult and is\nsubject to suspicions. The reestablishment of State authority\nand respect for the laws of the land are often identified, at\nbest, with constraints and, at worst, with arbitrary actions,\nwhile a country cannot become involved in development\nprojects without order or collective discipline.\nDespite the flaws noted in the implementation of human\nrights, Zaire has nevertheless made commendable efforts\nalong those lines by granting full freedom to the press and\nauthorizing the free exercise of political activities and the\nfree expression of opinions. It intends to follow up these\nmoves by cooperating with the specialized agencies of the\nUnited Nations in making more effective those bodies in\nZaire entrusted with ensuring the strict observance of human\nrights.\nThe democratization process is irreversible in Zaire and\nno one is contemplating re-establishing the old order. We\nall aspire to change and to the establishment of a State of\nlaw. What is important at the present stage of my country\u2019s\ndevelopment is to know how to implement that change\npeacefully. For now, we are asking the international\ncommunity and in particular those countries which wrongly\nbelieve that they have received a mandate to administer\nZaire to let the Zairians themselves settle their own\nproblems, for whenever they are free of foreign interference\nthey always manage to overcome their antagonisms. We\ntherefore urge our usual partners to help us to overcome this\ncrisis instead of dividing us by canonizing some and\nrendering others anathema.\nThe opportunity has thus been offered to certain\ncountries that call themselves champions of democracy to\nsupport the organization of free and transparent elections in\nZaire rather than to propose undemocratic plans that bring\npeople to power who do not have the vote of the population,\nwhich alone can confer legitimacy. That, in our view, is the\nonly way to rein in the excessive ambitions of certain\npolitical leaders who, in their obtrusive declarations in\nKinshasa and the Western capitals, are harming the proper\nunfolding of the democratization process.\nThe international community is certainly unaware of the\ndishonourable treatment experienced by Zairians in their\ntravel to other countries. At present, it is nearly impossible\nfor a citizen of Zaire to travel to, or opt to reside in, certain\ncountries of the northern hemisphere, since for his visa is\nautomatically refused unless he reviles his country and the\nlegally established authorities. Is it the full enjoyment of\nfundamental human freedoms when he cannot reside in a\nterritory other than his own unless he requests the status of\npolitical refugee? Are the citizens of Zaire treated this way\nbeing punished for their opinions? How can those countries\nthat practise this policy of exclusion have a precise idea of\nwhat is transpiring in Zaire when they are preventing one\ncategory of my fellow citizens from freely expressing\nthemselves and championing political ideas that run contrary\nto their own?\nThe political uncertainties that have overshadowed Zaire\nfor three years have pushed into the background the\neconomic and social problems of a country in which strikes,\ncity-wide shutdowns, civil disobedience and looting have\ntorn asunder the economic fabric and aggravated the\npeople\u2019s poverty. Zaire - which has seen itself arbitrarily\nand vexingly deprived, under the pressure of certain Western\nPowers, of access to financial facilities and to bilateral and\nmultilateral assistance at a time when its people has the\ngreatest need - hopes that the new era in the offing will\nprovide an opportunity for all its partners to assist it to\nrevive its collapsed economy.In this context, my country\nvery much hopes to resume dialogue with the Bretton\nWoods institutions to improve the management of public\nfinances and to promote the flourishing of free enterprise.\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5\nAs everyone knows, Zaire is a subcontinent made up of\na mosaic of tribes and ethnic groups which periodically, as\nhappens throughout the world, have trouble living together.\nAs we approach major political or electoral stages, tensions\nexacerbated by demagogues is transformed into open\nconflicts that compel, often in inhuman conditions, some of\nour compatriots to abandon their homes.\nThe Government of the Republic of Zaire cannot\ntolerate a situation in which citizens of Zaire find themselves\nrefugees in their own land. Thus, more specifically\nconcerning Shaba, it is not correct to speak of \\\"ethnic\ncleansing\\\", since the Shaba, like the two Kasai, are not\nethnic groups but the provincial homes of several ethnic\ngroups. The Government has taken measures to halt all\nforced displacements, ensure the security of those who wish\nto remain in Shaba, and organize transportation of those who\nhave opted to leave in humanly acceptable conditions. This\ntask, like that of the restoration of displaced persons to their\noriginal homes, requires enormous material and financial\nmeans.\nIn cooperation with the specialized bodies of the United\nNations and non-governmental organizations, the\nGovernment is working to gather all available means in\norder to come to the aid of the victims of this tragedy.\nHere we should like to welcome the action carried out,\nat the request of the President of the Republic, by the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, who sent a\nspecialized inter-agency team led by Mr. Darko Silovic to\nstudy in the field the ways and means to bring humanitarian\nassistance to these disadvantaged peoples. We fervently\nhope that the international community will respond\nmassively and positively to the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal,\nand we are grateful in advance for this.\nConcerning the ethnic difficulties in North Kivu, it is\nimportant to know that this is an ancient problem born of\ncolonization, which was then perpetuated by the\ntransplantation of Rwandese peoples to Zaire and by the\ninflux of refugees following the ethnic conflicts that\nneighbouring country has experienced. Without lingering\nover the underlying causes of this conflict, we should like to\ninform international opinion that the Government has taken\nmeasures to re-establish calm in the region and to ensure the\nsecurity of all parties to the conflict.\nAn appeal to humanitarian assistance for those peoples\nwho have lost everything in these sad events is sent out to\nthe international community, the non-governmental\norganizations and Zaire\u2019s customary partners, in light of the\nurgency of the situation and the paucity of our means which\ndo not allow us to cope with it alone.\nBefore concluding my statement, I should like to take\nup a problem which is of the greatest concern to the\ninternational community and to my country in particular:\nenvironmental protection. Zaire, whose considerable\nexpanse of tropical humid forest gives it the symbolic status\nof the planet\u2019s second lung would appreciate the\ninternational community\u2019s acknowledgement of the huge\nsacrifices it is making, which are depriving it of incalculable\nfinancial resources.\nThe preservation of the ozone layer requires that\nadditional resources be found for the implementation of\nAgenda 21 and the conventions dealing with biodiversity.\nThus, my country believes that its commitment not to cut\ndown various species of trees which it considers the\ncommon heritage of mankind should allow it to benefit from\ncertain types of compensation which would fill this financial\nvacuum or at least this lack of earning power.\nFinally, the delegation of the Republic of Zaire joins in\nthe request made by numerous delegations for a restructuring\nof the United Nations system to allow all Member States,\nregardless of size, fully to play their role in building a world\nof justice, peace and mutually advantageous cooperation.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nallow me at the outset to extend to you the warmest\ncongratulations of the Greek Government on your election\nto the presidency of the forty-eighth session of the General\nAssembly. Your distinguished personal qualities and\ndiplomatic skills augur well for the progress of work of the\ncurrent session.\nI should be remiss if I did not express the deep\nappreciation of the Greek Government to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations ,\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the most distinguished way\nin which he has been discharging his high duties. His\ndynamism, energy, perseverance, political will and\nleadership, together with a determined vision of the new\nworld structure, constitute invaluable and solid foundations\nfor a more efficient and creative United Nations response to\nthe challenges of the close of the twentieth century. He has\nour full support.\nLet me also join previous speakers in welcoming, from\nthis rostrum, the new Members that have been admitted to\nthe United Nations this year.\nWe were deeply shocked by the tragic news of the\ndevastating earthquake in India, which has resulted in the\nloss of tens of thousands of lives. I express, on behalf of\nthe Greek Government and of the Greek people, our sincere\nsympathy for the families of victims and for the friendly\npeople of India.\nEarlier this week, the Foreign Minister of Belgium, in\nhis capacity as President of the Council of the European\nCommunity, delivered a statement on behalf of the European\nCommunity and its 12 member States. My Government\nfully subscribes to its content.\nAn unprecedented and historic event has enhanced\nhopes for the peoples living in the Middle East. Israelis and\nPalestinians have made a courageous step, in Washington,\ntowards peace. Greece, together with its European\nCommunity partners, offers its full support for keeping the\npresent momentum so that the parties involved may soon\nreach comprehensive and lasting agreements. We have\nalways taken the stand that peace in the Middle East could\nbe achieved through direct dialogue between all the parties.\nThe Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Mitsotakis, addressing\nthe General Assembly in 1981 in his capacity as Foreign\nMinister stressed, inter alia, that:\n\\\"The prolongation of the Arab-Israeli conflict and\nthe failure of all unilateral attempts to resolve it\ndemonstrate that only dialogue among the parties,\nincluding the Palestine Liberation Organization, can\nlead to a just and lasting solution.\\\" (A/36/PV.16, p. 17)\nWe are extremely satisfied that these historic, direct talks\nhave paved the way to peace.\nIn today\u2019s global political landscape, the international\ncommunity must address many challenges that are neither\nfamiliar nor simple. Troubling developments in areas with\nvarying political and economic conditions are affecting\nmillions of people who are caught in a circle of violence and\nsuffering. Millions face starvation. We must take heart,\nhowever, from the determination of peoples in all parts of\nthe world to sustain freedom and human rights, and to\nchoose their futures even in the face of declining output,\nrising unemployment and inflation. In the quest for a better\nworld, for a better future, man is striving to improve his\nsocial, economic and political institutions.\nThe future of mankind is inextricably linked to the way\nin which we have lived and acted during the twentieth\ncentury and, in particular, during the last four decades.\nDuring this period the international community had rested its\nhopes on the United Nations system in order to address the\nchallenges of modern society. Our Organization has stood\nthe test of time. It has offered us a valuable service in the\nfields of peace and security. It has also helped us, to a great\nextent, in our common endeavours towards eliminating\ninjustice, economic imbalances and social disparities, and in\nsafeguarding the environment.\nWe firmly believe that all Members of the United\nNations, together, have a moral obligation to act in order to\nensure a better future for mankind. Previous speakers have\nduly stressed the need to react jointly to the challenges.\nIn this respect, allow me to announce that the\nGovernment of Greece, eager to contribute towards this end,\nhas the honour to propose the convening in Greece, in\nJanuary of the year 2000, of an international United Nations\nsummit aimed at adopting a global agenda for the twenty-\nfirst century. The general topic of this summit conference\ncould be \\\"Partners for a Better World: on the Threshold of\nthe Twenty-first Century\\\". An ad hoc preparatory committee\nor an open-ended working group of the whole could be\nestablished by this body to cope with the substance and the\norganizational aspects of the summit. Greece expresses its\nwillingness and readiness to work bilaterally and collectively\ntowards the realization of this United Nations summit\nconference. I might add that, after all, Greece was the\ncradle of the democracy that humanity as a whole now\nenjoys. It is the right place to hold the summit proposed by\nthe Greek Government.\nWe are living through a period of radical changes,\nespecially in Europe. Former adversaries are now\ncooperating on the basis of common values and principles.\nHistorical agreements have been reached in arms control and\narms reduction, both regionally and globally.\nThese changes have also brought new risks and\nuncertainties: the proliferation of new States; the\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 17\nreappearance of claims of numerous national minorities\nsuppressed under communism, and with them the danger of\ndisputed borders; and, on top of these, the economic collapse\nand heavy transition costs in the former communist\ncountries, as well as the re-emergence of nationalism,\nnational antagonisms, religious fanaticism and populist\ntendencies. All of these issues have set the stage for a new\napproach to the question of security and stability in Europe,\nwhich has emerged as the major issue of political importance\nin the old continent. Let me also emphasize that security in\nEurope is linked to the economic development and maturity\nof the democratic process and institutions in Eastern Europe,\nthe Balkan peninsula and the Maghreb. Uncontrolled and\nunlimited migration resulting from political turmoil and\neconomic hardship in these countries could cause social and\neconomic problems affecting even the more prosperous\ncountries in Western Europe.\nThe significance of the United Nations in maintaining\npeace has grown dramatically. It is enough to compare the\n13 peace-keeping operations undertaken during the first\n42 years of its existence with the same number of operations\nestablished between 1991 and 1992. Only last week the\nSecurity Council decided to establish two new peace-keeping\noperations in Haiti and in Liberia.\nThe prestige, credibility and power of the United\nNations have been enhanced by the positive outcome of the\npeace-keeping operations. However, the United Nations\nsystem was not ready to cope with such an extended\nchallenge, and there seems to be a consensus that United\nNations methods and capabilities need to be adjusted and\nimproved. More effective ways to prevent and contain\nconflicts have been considered by the United Nations, world\nleaders and respected think-tanks. The Secretary-General\u2019s\n\\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" has stimulated the ongoing\ndiscussions and has already resulted in the adoption of a\nseries of measures.\nGreece strongly supports the United Nations\npeace-keeping operations, as well as peace-building and\npeacemaking activities. Our presence in Somalia, Iraq,\nKuwait and Western Sahara indicates our increasing\ninvolvement in peace-keeping. In this context, I should also\nmention our contribution to the United Nations polling\nofficers unit in Cambodia and in other parts of the world.\nCyprus, a member of the United Nations, still remains\noccupied and divided. Thirty thousand Turkish troops\noccupy 38 per cent of the Republic. What is more,\nthousands of settlers from the mainland have upset the\ndemographic balance of the population. We note with deep\nconcern a complete lack of progress towards a solution of\nthe Cyprus problem during this year. In spite of the efforts\nof the Secretary-General and his representatives, talks in\nNew York and in Cyprus came to a standstill because of the\nunwillingness of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to engage in\nmeaningful negotiations either on the overall agreement or\non confidence-building measures. We join the\nSecretary-General\u2019s call to Turkey to fully assume its\nresponsibilities and exercise its decisive influence with the\nTurkish-Cypriot leaders in order to achieve progress.\nThe recent breakthrough in the Middle East has proved\nthat there are no intractable problems, if there is a political\nwill. This genuine will is required from Ankara in order to\nre-establish the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of\nCyprus, while guaranteeing and protecting the rights of all\nits citizens. Here, I would remind the Assembly that the\nquestion of the missing persons has not been resolved.\nGreece will maintain its constructive attitude in the hope that\nit will be reciprocated. My Government this year increased\nits contribution to the United Nations Peace-keeping Force\nin Cyprus to $6.5 million, as evidence of our strong\ncommitment to achieving a political settlement while\nsafeguarding peace in Cyprus.\nWe follow with particular attention the tireless efforts\nof the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to achieve\ndecisive reforms to consolidate the democratic institutions\nand establish an open market economy. We sympathize with\ntheir calls for assistance. We participate in all initiatives to\npromote a smooth integration of the newly established States\ninto international institutions. The consolidation of\ndemocratic institutions and processes in Russia is of the\nutmost importance for Europe and for my country in\nparticular.\nAn eloquent example of the upheaval brought about by\nthe dramatic changes in Europe is the situation in the former\nYugoslavia. Here, and especially in Bosnia, the upheaval\nhas turned into a tragedy of unprecedented proportions. No\nmatter how much we contribute to prevent and ease the\nsuffering of the people, there is no remedy unless and until\na political solution has been agreed upon by all parties.\nTheir leaders should understand that continued fighting\nincreases hatred and decreases the chances of a compromise,\nand should seize any acceptable opportunity for peace for\nthe sake of their people. The Co-Chairmen of the\nInternational Conference on the Former Yugoslavia have\nexercised all their ingenuity to convince those leaders of\nthese simple truths. They have consistently tried to guide\nnegotiations towards the principles of the London\nConference. Cyrus Vance, Thorvald Stoltenberg and\n18 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nLord Owen deserve our gratitude for their tremendous\nefforts.\nGreece, along with its European Community partners,\nplays a constructive role in the search for a negotiated\noverall settlement. We were close to an agreement last May\nafter the Athens meeting, for which the Greek Government\nand particularly the Prime Minister, Mr. Mitsotakis, worked\nhard. Let us hope that the present chance will not be\nmissed.\nWhen an agreement is reached in Bosnia, we must take\nan active part in the huge task of the reconstruction of the\nformer Yugoslavia. We propose to start planning for this\ntask right now. The main responsibility lies with the\nEuropean Community. Greece expresses its readiness to\nhost an international meeting for the rehabilitation and\nreconstruction of the former Yugoslavia, with the\nparticipation of donors, as well as of neighbouring countries.\nSubstantial economic and financial assistance is the\nprerequisite for achieving social harmony and consolidating\ndemocracy. Let us hope that peace will be achieved sooner\nrather than later. Serious consideration should be given now\nto planning for the day after peace is achieved.\nMay I remind the Assembly that the agreement between\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians came very suddenly. Only\nnow is the international community thinking of ways to\nassist the region to recover and achieve economic\nreconstruction and rehabilitation. Let us not be late in the\ncase of the former Yugoslavia. If we act right now, we act\non time. The day after should be taken into serious\nconsideration by all concerned, and especially by the\nEuropean Community and the neighbouring States.\nMy Government deeply appreciates the efforts of the\nCo-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International\nConference on the Former Yugoslavia in accordance with\nSecurity Council resolution 817 (1993). We thank\nMr. Vance for agreeing to continue these efforts in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 845 (1993).\nThe resolution of this problem will enhance stability in the\nBalkan region. Greece\u2019s position is clear: we are striving\nto eradicate a potential point of friction in the Balkans,\nfriction which may lead to tension with unpredictable and\nperhaps grave consequences.\nOn this occasion I reiterate our earnest desire to\nstrengthen, as far as possible, our relations with all our\nneighbours. We have pursued this policy consistently. To\nthis purpose, we will continue our efforts to enable our\nnorthern neighbours to accomplish the difficult task of\nreconstructing their economies. The Balkan economies are\ninextricably interdependent; we need the cooperation of our\nnorthern neighbours in order to link further our economies\nwith those of the Central, Northern and Western European\nStates. So our neighbours need the cooperation of Greece in\norder to integrate their economies with the European\nCommunity as well as to have access to the trade routes of\nthe Mediterranean and the Middle East.\nGreece is fully aware of the need to assist, and has\nalready enormously assisted, Albania in overcoming its\nconsiderable economic difficulties and consolidating its\ndemocratic institutions. At the same time, we again urge the\nAlbanian Government to grant in practice the fundamental\nminority rights established within the process of the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nparticularly in the fields of education and religion. Religious\nfreedom and the right to education should not be denied to\nthe Greek minority nor to any minority anywhere in the\nglobe. Albania cannot deny to the minorities within its\nborders what it itself asks for its minorities abroad.\nThe elimination of weapons of mass destruction,\nincluding in particular nuclear, chemical and biological\nweapons, is a goal towards which, despite progress achieved,\nwe must persevere. The signing of the chemical-weapons\nConvention on 12 January 1993 was an important step. We\nlook forward to the Conference of 1995 for an unconditional\nand indefinite renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We\nalso note with satisfaction the progress made towards the\nnegotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in\nVienna last June, has led to the emergence of common views\nand strategies involving large sectors of our societies and to\nprospects for better cooperation between the institutions and\norganizations active in this area.\nWe hope that the vicious circle of violence in South\nAfrica will end soon, with the cooperation of all South\nAfrican leaders, and that a new political system will be born.\nGreece, along with its European Community partners,\nintends to play a constructive role in assisting that country\nin its transition to majority rule.\nIn Somalia, the United Nations embarked upon the first\npeace enforcement operation to secure a safe environment\nfor humanitarian operations, disarm militia and pursue the\ndifficult task of political recovery. Pacification has been\naccomplished to a large extent\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 19\nthough serious problems remain. As a troop contributor to\nthe United Nations Operation in Somalia, Greece firmly\nbelieves that this operation should not be allowed to fail.\nGreece and its European Community partners maintain\na fruitful dialogue in both political and economic matters\nwith the countries of Latin America. This dialogue will be\ncontinued with great interest at the San Jose and Rio\nministerial meetings, which will take place next year under\nthe Greek presidency of the European Community and in\nGreece.\nIn many of the poorest developing countries, standards\nof living continue to decline, while in other developing\ncountries the results of economic performance are, to say the\nleast, mixed. Thus, some economies in Asia are vibrant.\nLatin America, with the debt crisis behind it, has pursued\nsuccessful structural adjustment programmes. On the other\nhand, in half of the developing world the picture remains\nbleak. It is particularly so in Africa. The needs are\ncompelling.\nWe share the view that growth should be sustainable in\nthat it creates more employment, less poverty and greater\nequality of opportunity, and also in that it promotes human\nfreedom and the preservation of the environment. Successful\nnational policies are necessary to bring about greater\nparticipation by the people in economic, social and political\nlife.\nIn concluding my statement, I appeal to every Member,\nnot only in my capacity as Foreign Minister of Greece, but\nalso as a man who wants to see his grandchildren live in a\ndifferent, better world - a world of tolerance, peace and\nsolidarity. Let us join our efforts and share our experience\nfor a better tomorrow. Let us be tolerant of each other in\norder to ensure a better life for our children and for their\nchildren. Let us ensure that solidarity and partnership\nprevail over sterile antagonism, micronationalism and\ntotalitarian ideologies and regimes. Let us work together to\neliminate war, famine, genocide, \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\",\nholocaust, xenophobia, racism and aggression.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Samuel\nInsanally on his election to his responsible post, and to wish\nhim every success in his work.\nAllow me also to express gratitude to the President of\nour last session, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, for his able guidance of\nour work, and to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-\nGeneral, for his dynamic, tireless work to restructure the\nOrganization and enhance its effectiveness, given the\nqualitative changes occurring in the system of international\nrelations.\nI should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the\nnew members of the United Nations: the Czech Republic,\nthe Slovak Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Eritrea, Monaco and Andorra.\nThe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place at a momentous time. The twentieth century,\nwhich has experienced two of the most destructive wars in\nthe history of mankind, as well as the cold war and the arms\nrace, which have depleted natural and financial resources,\nthe intellectual and moral potential of civilization, is\nnevertheless ending on an optimistic note. Totalitarian\nregimes have fallen, scores of countries have gained\nindependence and universal values of democracy and the\nmarket economy are now finding new advocates throughout\nthe world.\nWe are proud that our small country, which straddles\nEurope and Asia, a country with an ancient culture and a\nproud history, has not been left behind in the truly universal\nhistorical process of the triumph of democracy and national\nand economic revival. Azerbaijan regained its independence\nless than two years ago. The path travelled by our country\nover these 22 months has not been without difficulties and\nhas been marked by contradictions and tragic events.\nNevertheless, we are convinced that the young State of\nAzerbaijan is following the only true path leading to genuine\nindependence.\nThis has been borne out by the results of the recent\npresidential elections held at the beginning of October, when\nthe overwhelming majority of the people of Azerbaijan voted\nfor Mr. Heydar Aliyev, an experienced politician and\nrecognized leader of our country, who is firmly committed\nto the idea of building a democratic, secular society with a\nmarket economy.\nUnfortunately, the natural historical process of the fall\nof empires and the acquisition of independence and\nstatehood by their peoples is often accompanied by excesses\nof extreme nationalism. Many attempt to exploit the\ndemocratization of the social and political life of young\nindependent States to undermine their internal stability.\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nNationalist separatist movements are often used as a way to\nachieve these ends.\nUnfortunately, Azerbaijan has fallen victim to such acts\nof provocation. For six years now the Republic of Armenia\nhas been waging an undeclared war against Azerbaijan to\nfulfil its territorial claims. The sad facts of Armenia\u2019s\naggression are as follows: 20 per cent of the territory of\nAzerbaijan is now occupied by Armenian troops, and\n1 million of our country\u2019s civilians have no homes or means\nof survival. The economic infrastructure of the Azerbaijani\nRepublic\u2019s occupied region has been destroyed. Unique\nhistorical and cultural sites of Azerbaijan have been\ndestroyed. And all this is occurring under the cover of an\nongoing propaganda campaign and alleged non-involvement\nby the Republic of Armenia in the aggression.\nAzerbaijan has often proclaimed, and continues to\nproclaim, its commitment to the principle of the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes. We welcome and commend the\nefforts of the international community, the United Nations\nand the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(CSCE) as well as the efforts made by individual States -\nRussia, the United States, Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan - in\nrecent years to achieve a peaceful settlement of the\nArmenia/Azerbaijan conflict.\nAzerbaijan welcomed the Security Council\u2019s adoption\nof resolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993) calling for the\nimmediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the\noccupying forces from Azerbaijan territory that had been\nseized. Azerbaijan also welcomed the initial timetable -\nworked out within the framework of the Minsk Group of the\nCSCE - of urgent steps to implement Security Council\nresolutions 822 (1993) and 853 (1993), several revised drafts\nof which, however, were aborted because of the Armenian\nside.\nAzerbaijan stresses its commitment to the initial\napproach of the CSCE - that is, that the Minsk Conference\nshould be preceded by the complete liberation of\nAzerbaijan\u2019s occupied territories. This was stressed in\nparticular by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\nG. A. Aliyev, yesterday during the reception for CSCE\nrepresentatives who are now visiting the region.\nWe are confident that, despite certain difficulties -\nsometimes substantive - in the approach to the terms of the\npeaceful settlement of the conflict, the political realism and\nthe sense of responsibility for the fate of our people shown\nby the Azerbaijan side will be appreciated by our negotiating\npartners.\nAzerbaijan, which is richly endowed with a variety of\nnatural resources and which has a fairly well-developed\nindustrial potential, has all the conditions necessary to\novercome our objective difficulties in this transitional period\ntowards a market economy.However, since one out of every\nsix inhabitants of our country has been forced to leave his\nhome and now has no means of survival, as a result of the\nhostilities and occupation of one fifth of our territory, the\nhumanitarian assistance provided by various international\norganizations that have enormous experience in this area is\nassuming great importance for our country.\nIn this difficult period for my country, Azerbaijan - and\nprimarily the people of Azerbaijan, who have suffered most -\nhas been given all round support and assistance by the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Health\nOrganization and the International Federation of Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Societies. On behalf of my people and\nGovernment, I take this opportunity to express profound\ngratitude to all international organizations, humanitarian\ninstitutions and specialized agencies and the peoples and\nGovernments of many States that have responded to the\nsuffering of the Azerbaijan people who have fallen victim to\naggression.\nThe Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan also\nexpresses profound gratitude to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for having established a United\nNations - United Nations Development Programme Interim\nOffice in Azerbaijan. We are deeply convinced that the\nactivities of this Office will help to strengthen and expand\nthe comprehensive relations between our Republic and the\nUnited Nations system. We are convinced, also, that this\ncooperation will be mutually advantageous in view of the\ninitial results of interaction between the Republic of\nAzerbaijan and the system of specialized agencies of the\nUnited Nations, the majority of which our country joined in\n1992 and 1993.\nWe attach overriding importance to international\ncooperation in the field of the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment and also to the comprehensive expansion of\nworld trade and the elimination of all barriers that restrict\nthat process.\nAzerbaijan welcomed the decision to convene a World\nSummit for Social Development and is prepared to take an\nactive part in preparing for that Summit, the successful\nconvening of which we believe will lay the basis for an\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 23\neffective global development strategy for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOur country is taking an active part in the preparations\nfor the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements\n(Habitat II), which will take place in 1996 in Istanbul.\nThus despite the objective and subjective difficulties\nencountered by my country, Azerbaijan, during the past year\nhas been taking decisive action to integrate itself fully into\nthe world community. We are convinced that integration\ninto the world\u2019s political, economic and humanitarian\nprocess is possible only by increasing cooperation between\nStates at the bilateral and multilateral levels.\nOur country shares the general conviction regarding the\nneed to reduce the threat of the use of weapons of mass\ndestruction and subsequently to destroy them, has acceded to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and\nis taking an active part in the preparatory work for the\nReview Conference that will take place in 1995. Azerbaijan\nsupports the indefinite extension of that Treaty and believes\nthat it should be made universal. We are convinced that the\nnon-proliferation Treaty is an instrument that strengthens all\ninternational efforts and regional initiatives that seek to\nprevent any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\nto eliminate obstacles that threaten international and regional\npeace and security.\nIn this connection we welcome the positive steps taken\nrecently in the area of disarmament, including the adoption\nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and\non Their Destruction, which was signed by Azerbaijan and\nthe majority of countries of the world.\nOne outstanding example of our progress towards\nbuilding a democratic, lawful State was Azerbaijan\u2019s\naccession to the basic instruments of international law in the\narea of human rights, such as the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the\nRights of the Child, the Convention relating to the Status of\nRefugees (1951) and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status\nof Refugees, and some others. Our country is very\ninterested in the various initiatives being taken in the area of\nprotecting human rights. The idea of establishing, within the\nUnited Nations system, a new post of high commissioner for\nhuman rights, reflects an intention to enhance international\ncooperation in this area. We are prepared actively to\nparticipate in the discussions on this question.\nAnother pressing issue, one that requires urgent and\nconstant attention, is that of refugees and displaced persons.\nIt is time for the international community to draw up proper\nrules and standards to govern massive, forced migrations\nwhich could help overcome their main causes and\nconsequences.\nDesirous of making a worthy contribution to the various\nareas of the activities of the United Nations, Azerbaijan\nsubmitted its candidacy for, and was elected to, the\nCommission on Human Settlements and the\nIntergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology\nfor Development. We are convinced that the great scientific\npotential and practical experience of our specialists will help\nthese commissions to do effective work.\nIn 1995 the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth\nanniversary. In the almost five decades that have elapsed\nsince the United Nations was created, its historic meaning\nand universality have become strikingly clear. Today it is\ntime for serious, meaningful changes, changes commensurate\nwith the needs of our rapidly changing world. We believe\nthat, given the new context of international relations, the\nrestructuring of the United Nations, and particularly of the\nSecurity Council, must meet the great expectations of\nMember States. Expansion of the membership of the\nSecurity Council, the need for which is the subject of serious\ndiscussion, should help the Council continue effectively to\ndischarge its primary task, that of the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.Of course the role and\nresponsibility of the Secretary-General will shift towards\nenhanced peacemaking and diplomatic activity.\nIn conclusion, we look to the future with optimism, to\na future where peace and cooperation will prosper. We call\nupon States Members of the United Nations to make every\neffort to promote the establishment of a safe, secure,\ncommon home. We are sure that constructive discussions\nand debates at this session will make an important\ncontribution to the building of a better world in the coming\ncentury.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by\ncongratulating the President, on his election to his high\noffice. I wish him every success and pledge to him the full\nsupport of my delegation.\nIt gives me pleasure to welcome the new Member\nStates which have joined the Organization since the\nbeginning of the forty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly - the new Member States of Andorra, Eritrea, the\nCzech Republic, Monaco, the Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, and Slovakia. With 184 Member States - and\neven more prospective Members - our Organization is able\nto claim for itself a higher degree of universality than ever.\nIn extending the reach of the United Nations, we serve\nthe basic goals for which our Organization was brought into\nbeing; for the rule of law, freedom and the dignity and worth\nof the human person are ideals common to all men,\nirrespective of their cultural or geographical surroundings.\nBut the simple reach of the United Nations must not be\nconfused with its comprehensiveness as an institution.\nTherefore, as we recommit ourselves to the basic objectives\ninscribed in the United Nations Charter almost 50 years ago,\nwe must also maintain the flexibility necessary to readjust\nour structures and working habits accordingly.\nThe question how to maintain the cohesiveness of the\nUnited Nations amidst the myriad - and at times conflicting -\ndemands being made of it presents itself nowadays with\nparticular force. Changes on the world stage have taken\nplace with almost dizzying speed in the last four years. The\nmost important of those changes, the passing of the cold\nwar, has created new opportunities for the United Nations\nand has raised expectations among the peoples of the world\nat large. At the same time, the world itself has in many\nways become more unpredictable, placing serious obstacles\non the path of long-term planning.\nTo escape this quandary, there is a need to take a\nbalanced view of what the United Nations can and cannot be\nexpected to do. We must moderate ambition with reality.\nWe must not divorce the words we use from the actions we\nare willing to take. If we do, we may indeed succeed in\nbuilding a Platonic city in speech, a United Nations which\nwould stand only a limited chance of ever being actualized,\nbut the down side would be to risk undermining the trust\ninvested by the public in our Organization.\nOn the bright side, a number of recent developments\nhave helped the United Nations in translating its basic vision\ninto reality. Breakthroughs have taken place in regional\nconflicts which have been a thorn in the side of the\ninternational community for several decades. Governments\nhave increasingly come to recognize the growing threat to\nthe ecosystem of our planet. The protection of human rights\nis no longer seen as the exclusive domain of the nation\nState. Last but not least, mankind has moved further away\nfrom the brink of nuclear Armageddon.\nThose are considerable accomplishments. But this is\nnone the less hardly the time for members of the community\nof nations to congratulate each other. There are regions of\nthe world where terrifying carnage is still taking place before\nour very eyes. Deterioration of the environment, while\nhighly uneven in gravity and scope, is a long way from\nbeing reversed. Human-rights abuses continue in many\nplaces on an appalling scale. And while the threat of a\nworldwide nuclear catastrophe may have passed, there is a\ndangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,\nbringing uncertainty and new instabilities in its wake. Now\nis clearly the time to rise above these issues that divide our\nAssembly and to concentrate our efforts on dealing with\nsuch challenges effectively.\nThe landmark peace agreement recently signed between\nformer adversaries in the Middle East should be a source of\nencouragement to all nations. We are being reminded of the\nancient truth that where there is sufficient devotion and will\namong the parties concerned, there is also a way to solve\neven the most intractable issues. My Government welcomes\nthe historic accord between the State of Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization. We hope that the mutual\nrecognition of the two parties will yield further agreements\nin the region, paving the way for a comprehensive peace\nsettlement.\nWhile paying tribute to the vision and bravery of Israeli\nand Palestinian leaders, I take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the Government of Norway on its initiative in\nbringing the ancient adversaries together at the same table,\nand I also commend the Governments of the United States\nand Russia for their valuable mediation. It is now up to the\nworld community to provide the political support and the\neconomic aid for reconstruction so vitally needed to keep the\nprocess alive. The Nordic Governments, for their part, have\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nalready decided to participate fully in that endeavour. This\nis a process which cannot be permitted to fail.\nThe world community has recently witnessed another\nbold step forward, which, hopefully, also marks an important\ncontribution to international peace and stability. I am\nreferring to the courageous statesmanship of the President of\nthe Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, in moving decisively\ntowards democratic elections to Parliament. As the only\ndemocratically elected representative of the Russian people,\nPresident Yeltsin deserves the vigorous support of the\noutside world in carrying out his far-reaching programme of\nreform.\nA different area offering a glimmer of hope is South\nAfrica. My Government welcomes recent progress towards\ngenuine democracy in South Africa, including the decision\nto hold free and fair elections next year. The international\ncommunity should now speedily heed the call of Mr. Nelson\nMandela, made from this podium last week, for the removal\nof all economic sanctions, an action Iceland hopes will serve\nfully to normalize the status of South Africa in the\ncommunity of nations. Iceland, for its part, has already\nabolished the embargo on trade with South Africa.\nSadly, we face continuation of the conflicts in the\nformer Yugoslavia, not least the tragic situation prevailing in\nBosnia and Herzegovina. It serves to remind us that ethnic\nconflicts can no longer be regarded as the sole responsibility\nof individual States. The inhumanity perpetrated on innocent\ncivilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other former\nYugoslav Republics has reached a point where the\ninternational community must act, and decisively, with all\nthe resources provided for in the Charter of the United\nNations. My Government fully supports the negotiations\nsponsored by the United Nations and the European\nCommunity, and looks forward to an early agreement and\nimplementation of the Geneva peace plan. The parties to the\nconflict must be brought to realize that a solution can be\nfound only through peaceful means. Iceland also attaches\nimportance to the effective functioning of the war crimes\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Those responsible for\natrocities must be brought to justice.\nAs the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has exposed\nthe present limitations of regional structures, the United\nNations has assumed responsibility for reintroducing peace\nand stability in the area. Meanwhile, there are outstanding\nexamples of cooperation and coordination between the\nUnited Nations and other organizations, including the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Western European\nUnion (WEU) and the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolutions with regard to the former\nYugoslavia.\nIn Iceland\u2019s view there is a need to develop these\nrelationships further. Suffice it to say that NATO\u2019s\nreadiness to employ military force for the relief of Sarajevo\nand for the long-term implementation of the Geneva peace\nplan would serve the interests of the international community\nand should therefore be welcomed and encouraged.\nTwo years ago we welcomed the three Baltic States,\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as sovereign Members of the\nUnited Nations. Since then the world community, and their\nEuropean neighbours in particular, have reached out and\noffered cooperation and help in the ongoing reconstruction\nof those Republics. The Baltic States have, for their part,\ndemonstrated their willingness to live up to the highest\nstandards of democratic societies. They adhere to\ninternational instruments and are members of organizations\nthat are fully capable of monitoring their respect for\ninternational obligations in the field of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. I should like to express my\nGovernment\u2019s hope that negotiations on the departure of all\nforeign military forces from Estonia and Latvia will soon be\nsuccessfully concluded and a clear timetable established.\nThe recent departure of foreign forces from Lithuania should\nset an example.\nRestoring the environment and attaining sustainable\nglobal development are among the most challenging tasks\nfacing the world community today. The outcome of the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, held in Rio de Janeiro last year, has brought\nthose tasks into sharper focus. The subsequent establishment\nof the Commission on Sustainable Development was an\nimportant step in facilitating international cooperation for the\neffective follow-up and implementation of the outcome of\nthe Conference. However, declarations, strategies and action\nplans are only as good as their implementation. If the\ncredibility of the United Nations in this area is to be\nmaintained in the wake of the Rio Conference, we must\nmake sure to obtain real action and results.\nThe action programme contained in Agenda 21 of the\nRio Conference provides a sound basis for our individual or\njoint activities aimed at sustainable development. It does\nnot, however, cover all activities harmful to the environment,\nincluding pollution of the marine environment from\nland-based activities and the depletion of marine living\nresources in many parts of the world. While the programme\ncontains important recommendations pertinent to these\nForty-eighth session - 27 September l993 35\nissues, the main responsibility for developing global action\nto protect the marine environment and to conserve its living\nresources has been delegated to other forums, including the\nUnited Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and\nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks.\nIceland has participated actively in that Conference.\nTogether with Argentina, Canada, Chile and New Zealand,\nIceland has submitted a draft convention that seeks to deal\non a global level with the conservation and rational\nmanagement of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory\nfish stocks. Consistent with the United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea, the draft convention calls for\nincreased regional cooperation in the establishment of\nconservation and management measures and elaborates\nmechanisms for the enforcement of agreed measures. My\nGovernment will continue to work with all other interested\nGovernments to achieve results at the next session of the\nConference, results acceptable to all fishing nations, both\ndistant-water States and coastal States.\nAs a nation overwhelmingly dependent on marine living\nresources, Iceland has supported efforts to establish an\ninternational regime to govern all aspects of the uses of the\noceans. Iceland participated actively in the Third United\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea and ratified the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1985.\nIceland believes that the Convention provides for a widely\nacceptable regime for the rational exploitation of the world\u2019s\nmarine resources and establishes rules for a wide range of\nuses for the seas, thereby reducing the potential for conflict\namong States in this field.\nThe Government of Iceland is greatly encouraged by\nthe results of the most recent round of consultations, under\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General, directed at addressing\nproblems which have prevented certain industrialized\ncountries from becoming parties to the Convention. We are\nhopeful that at the next round agreement will be reached on\nthe framework of negotiations which will enable the early\nentry into force of the Convention with universal\nparticipation.\nAs early as 1989 Iceland emphasized in this forum the\nneed for a new international instrument, an \\\"Earth Charter\\\",\nwhich would define the responsibilities and rights of nations\nwith respect to the environment. My Government regrets\nthat an agreement on such a charter was not reached before\nthe Rio Conference. We would therefore strongly support\ntransforming the Rio Declaration into an \\\"Earth Charter\\\"\nbefore the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations two\nyears hence.\nAll nations have an obligation not only to protect and\npreserve the environment, but also to promote human rights\nand foster social and economic progress. The United\nNations Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna last\nJune was a world event of major significance. The results\nof the Conference, especially when seen in the context of\nimprovements in the international political climate in the\nrecent past, give us reason to hope for a more effective\nimplementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\neverywhere.\nFor the first time ever it appears that the majority of\ncountries in the world now pledge allegiance to the\nprinciples of democratic rule of law. Still, we are\nconfronted with breaches of human rights all around the\nworld. In the follow-up to the Conference on Human\nRights, we must address such breaches squarely and focus\nattention on ensuring greater respect and accountability by\nGovernments for the protection of human rights. This\nmeans, among other things, devoting more resources to this\nfield as a reflection of the political commitment of Member\nStates. Increased resources are required if the Centre for\nHuman Rights is to be able to provide effective advisory\nservices and human-rights monitoring. At the same time,\nIceland would like to support the establishment of the post\nof high commissioner for human rights.\nThe determination of our countries to promote social\nprogress and better standards of life is an important\ncommitment embedded in the United Nations Charter.\nIceland hopes that the world summit in 1995 will serve to\nbring issues of social development into sharper focus and\nhighlight, in particular, the plight of the more than one\nbillion people living below the absolute poverty line.\nIn this connection, I would like to draw special\nattention to the growing problem of world population\ncontrol, which could have serious social, economic and\nenvironmental repercussions if not properly managed in the\ndecades ahead. Around 90 per cent of the predicted world\npopulation growth between now and the end of the first\nquarter of the twenty-first century is expected to occur in the\ndeveloping countries, placing enormous new strains on their\nresources. Against this background, the decision to convene\nan international conference on population and development\nin Cairo next year is to be welcomed.\nTo stimulate social development, we need, among other\nthings, economic growth. The liberalization of world trade\nis the single most important vehicle for world economic\ngrowth. The growing importance of the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is clearly manifested in the\n36 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nflood of new accessions and the overriding importance\nattached to the Uruguay Round by the Governments of the\nworld. Since the end of the cold war, GATT has achieved\nan even greater role in international relations; countries in\ntransition see it as a vital venue for their relations with each\nother and for their integration into the world economy. In\nthe last few years political walls between cultures and\nnations have been demolished. Trade barriers must not,\nhowever, be allowed to replace iron curtains.\nEconomic reform, the environment, job-creation and\ninvestment, to name but a few, are issues that affect and are\naffected by international trade. A successful conclusion of\nthe Uruguay Round, which now seems to be within reach,\nwould dramatically improve our ability to deal with those\nproblems through international cooperation and trade. A\nfailure, on the other hand, would be a fatal blow to the\nmultinational trading system and to GATT. Protectionism\nwould again raise its ugly head and conflicts would erupt,\nwith disastrous consequences for the world economy.\nGATT\u2019s business is therefore the world\u2019s business.\nThe Uruguay Round represents a tremendous opportunity to\nrevitalize world trade. All countries stand to gain from this.\nThe biggest gain will accrue to the developing countries and\nto economies in transition. We who are gathered here at the\nGeneral Assembly representing the citizens, our countries\u2019\nconsumers, cannot and must not allow special-interest groups\nto block the negotiations in the few strenuous final steps\nneeded to reach the goal before the end of this year.\nIssues of social and economic development, of human\nrights and of environmental protection are part and parcel of\nthe notion of extended security, which we are all getting\naccustomed to in the aftermath of the cold war. Arms\ncontrol remains, however, a very important element of\npost-cold-war security. The success achieved in nuclear- and\nconventional-arms control in recent years represents a\nhistorical turning-point which must be exploited for the\nlong-term advancement of global peace and stability. Here,\nthe United Nations is singularly well placed to assume a\nmore active role. This applies to both global perspectives\nand support for regional initiatives.\nThe systematic acquisition of nuclear warheads, ballistic\nmissiles, and chemical and biological weapons by a number\nof States is a matter of serious concern to the international\ncommunity. Non-proliferation should be given priority and\nefforts made to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is both universally\nadhered to and indefinitely extended. It is also to be hoped\nthat the present moratorium on nuclear testing will\neventually be succeeded by a comprehensive and verifiable\ntest ban.\nPeace-keeping operations are among the areas where\nthe Organization has enjoyed considerable success. The\nresult is that Member States have placed increasing demands\non the Organization. However, the time has now come to\nreview the activities of the United Nations in this field. The\ngoal must be to ensure that peace-keeping operations serve\nthe purpose for which they were intended and that their\nmandates are specific and more limited in time. In this\nconnection, the idea of a United Nations stand-by force that\nwould enable the United Nations to act swiftly when crises\narise should be carefully considered. The existence of such\na force would enhance the credibility of and respect for the\nOrganization. Meanwhile, Member States must live up to\ntheir current obligations and pay their assessed contributions\nto peace-keeping operations in full and on time.\nAt the outset of my speech I referred to the need for\nthe United Nations to be responsive to change. Since the\nlast review of the membership of the Security Council took\nplace, there has been a substantial increase in the number of\nStates Members of the United Nations. At the same time the\nCouncil has, especially in recent years, increasingly assumed\nthe role envisaged for it in the relevant provisions of the\nCharter. The time is therefore ripe to review the Council\u2019s\nmembership. The goal of such a review must be to make\nthe Council more representative and thus, indeed, more\neffective.\nI would like to welcome initiatives taken recently to\nstreamline the structure of the United Nations and to make\nits daily operations and management more effective. This is\nnecessary in particular in order for the Organization to\nregain the trust of its Member States. In this connection,\nIceland favours the establishment of a permanent office of\ninspections and investigations and hopes that such an office\nwill help to ensure that allegations of fraud, waste and\ncorruption are investigated expeditiously.\nNow, more than ever, there is an opportunity for the\nUnited Nations to adapt to the positive political\ndevelopments of the recent past and to revamp its structures\nfrom within. Let us join forces in building a stronger United\nNations, a United Nations which embodies the ideals of its\nfounders and remains at the same time responsive to the\nbasic needs of people everywhere.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to express\nmy warmest congratulations to Ambassador Insanally, on his\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its forty-\neighth session. I should also like to welcome into our midst\nAndorra, the Czech Republic, Eritrea, the former Yugoslav\nRepublic of Macedonia, Monaco and Slovakia, whose recent\nadmissions have brought the United Nations even closer to\nbecoming truly universal.\nDuring the last year, the international community\ncontinued to face extremely grave challenges. This period\nhas seen, along with certain positive achievements, more\nalarming failures and disappointments. The questions to\nwhich we have to respond take us back once again to the\nbasic problem of multilateralism, that is to say, to defining\nin our complex world the values that can ensure a cohesion\nwhich is necessary for our common will to be translated into\njoint action.\nThe fall of communist dictatorships in Central and\nEastern Europe and the end of super-Power confrontation\nhave brought about an international political climate in\nwhich new approaches can be found in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the resolution of global\nproblems. They are based on greater opportunities for closer\ninteraction and the participation of each and every United\nNations Member State in managing and influencing the\ncourse of events. These opportunities and the ability of the\ninternational community to turn them into tangible results are\nmanifest in the conflict-resolution processes in Central\nAmerica and South-East Asia, in the resolute reversal of\nbrutal aggression in the Gulf, in the fundamental\ntransformation we are witnessing in South Africa and in the\nhistoric agreement in the Middle East. These evolutions\nclearly demonstrate that with political courage,\nfar-sightedness and readiness for compromise, even the most\nintractable problems can be untangled and resolved. They\nshow us an example that ought to be emulated in all regions\nof the world.\nThe convulsions of the new era of world history are\nstrongly felt in a country like Hungary which, as it has so\noften in its history, finds itself again close to conflict-ridden\nareas. Despite the difficulties that inevitably accompany the\nhistoric transition processes of the region, the Hungarian\nGovernment, ever since it took office in 1990, has been\nstriving consistently and successfully to maintain the\ncountry\u2019s internal stability and to ensure that it remains a\nmainstay of stability in our troubled region. Stability should\nbe omnipresent and universal, and we have to find the\nappropriate ways and means to achieve it.\nAs regards the old continent, Hungary wants to see\ndemocracy, prosperity, security and the institutions, such as\nthe Council of Europe, the European Community and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that lie at its\nfoundation, gradually expand eastward.\nFor some time now the world has been living in the\nshadow of events that ominously remind us of the darkest\nperiods in the history of mankind. The conflict in the\nformer Yugoslavia has been raging for more than two years.\nBut most regrettably, not even the worst cases of disregard\nfor the norms of international law and the principles\nenshrined in the Charter, not even the gravest crimes against\nhumanity and the most brutal mass violations of fundamental\nhuman and minority rights, have proven to be sufficient to\npersuade the world, when there was still time, to counter\naggression promptly and effectively, to prevent the\nacquisition of territory by use of force and to take a firm\nstand against the abhorrent policy of \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\".\nThe end result of such policies of passivity,\nappeasement and complacency, of the striking lack of an\nability to learn from past experiences and of the absence of\nthe necessary political will to act, is well documented right\nhere, in this building, in a shocking and soul-stirring photo\nexhibition about the horrors of war in the former Yugoslavia.\nIt brings home a painful awareness of the practical\nconsequences of unbridled extreme nationalism and the\ncompelling message not to relax and relent in our national,\nregional and international efforts to uphold in an\nuncompromising manner the purposes and principles of the\nCharter.\nForty-eighth session - 30 September l993 19\nThe renewal of Central and Eastern Europe and the\neconomic and social processes there have thrown to the\nsurface tendencies of political and ethnic fundamentalism\nwhich, having been elevated to the level of official State\npolicy, have unleashed or could lead to conflicts threatening\nthe security of the whole of Europe. In our interdependent\nworld, every nation on Earth, irrespective of where it is\nsituated, should realize the danger of this venomous\ncontagion if it were allowed to spread across our planet.\nThe people and the Government of Hungary continue\nto follow the developments of the crisis in the former\nYugoslavia with utmost concern. As a country immediately\nadjacent to the crisis area, Hungary has sought to avoid\nbeing dragged into this conflict, while continuing at the same\ntime to voice its principled position on the crisis and abiding\nby the relevant decisions of the international community.\nOne has to reckon with the fact that this crisis is not\nlimited to the war-torn areas of Bosnia and Croatia. It\nfesters in Serbia proper, where there is growing pressure on\nthe different ethnic communities inhabiting the country,\nincluding the Hungarian community in Vojvodina. In this\nformerly autonomous province, the successive waves of\nintimidation and discrimination have already significantly\nreduced both the size and the proportion of the Hungarian\nminority. There continues to be a constant threat of a\nfurther massive influx of refugees into Hungary, I am afraid.\nIn the conditions prevailing in Serbia and Montenegro, just\nas in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, it is of utmost\nimportance to seek adequate international protection for these\nethnic communities and national minorities. Indeed, one of\nthe key issues in settling the crisis is to ensure their rights\nwithout any discrimination, whether they have majority or\nminority status, with the same norms and standards applying\nto each and every one of them.\nBecause of its geographical situation, Hungary finds\nitself confronted with special economic problems arising\nfrom the implementation of sanctions imposed by the\nSecurity Council against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n(Serbia and Montenegro). Our economic and financial losses\ndirectly attributable to the effects of implementing the\nsanctions are constantly growing, and have now reached $1\nbillion. We highly appreciate the steps taken so far by the\nSecurity Council vis-\u00e0-vis those countries that have suffered\neconomic losses and have made use of their right to consult\nthe Security Council under Article 50 of the Charter. We\ntrust that the international organizations and institutions\nconcerned will find early solutions to help alleviate those\npressing problems. It is clear from the experience gained in\nconnection with the various sanctions regimes in place that\nattention from the international community commensurate\nwith the scale of the problems caused to third countries is\nrequired in order to examine how best we can establish an\neffective mechanism for the implementation of Article 50.\nWithout such a mechanism, the burden placed on an\never-growing number of countries fulfilling their\ninternational obligations will remain disproportionately and\nunjustly heavy.\nIn this connection, it is totally unacceptable to take\nretaliatory measures in response to actions by any State in\nfulfilment of its obligations under the Charter. Therefore,\nillegal measures such as attempts to block free and safe\nnavigation on the Danube river, which is an international\nwaterway vital for many countries of Europe, warrant\ninternational action, and the States concerned rightly expect\nthe international organizations to provide effective assistance\nin this matter.\nIn the light of recent bitter experiences, we have\nbecome more acutely aware that the world cannot be made\na safer place unless there are international organizations able\nand willing to take resolute and timely action. Multilateral\ndiplomacy must be at its best if it is to offer remedies where\nother possibilities for preventing or settling conflicts have\nbeen exhausted. We consider it especially important that the\nvarious tools of preventive diplomacy and crisis management\nshould be constantly at the disposal of the international\ncommunity.\nHungary is highly interested in the ongoing work aimed\nat a comprehensive review and enhancement of the United\nNations peace-keeping, peacemaking and peace- building\nactivities. Many substantive proposals have been made and\nuseful observations put forward in this regard. We hope that\nthey will assist in our endeavours to carry out genuine and\npurpose-oriented reform measures in the world Organization.\nWe expect that the present session of the General Assembly\nwill move us ahead in the debate on how to bring certain\nprovisions of the Charter into line with the changing realities\nof our world. Conditions seem ripe today for giving most\nserious consideration to questions relating to the review of\nthe Charter. The fundamental aim of such a review is to\nmake the United Nations function better. At the same time,\nit should in no way undermine the effectiveness of the\ndecision-making processes at the United Nations. In this\ncontext, Hungary fully understands the pressing financial\nsituation of the world Organization and, as its contribution\nto redressing this state of affairs, has, as of this year,\neliminated all its arrears to the regular budget.\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn our view, there are, inter alia, two particular areas\nwhere a review of the provisions of the Charter is needed.\nFirst, there is a long-overdue need for a review of those\nCharter provisions that imply a distinction between United\nNations Member States on the basis of their status of\nsignatory or enemy State. On the eve of the fiftieth\nanniversary of the birth of the United Nations, the\nelimination of this obsolete distinction would be more than\na gesture towards a number of countries that have, over the\nyears, fully proved their commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter. Secondly, the role\nplayed in today\u2019s world politics by some States and their\ncontribution to the realization of the purposes and principles\nof the Charter justify their more intimate involvement in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We are\naware that the issue of the enlargement of the permanent\nmembership of the Security Council will be the subject of\nfurther discussions. However, we believe that two countries\n- Germany and Japan - already qualify to play the enhanced\nrole that would stem from permanent membership in the\nSecurity Council.\nMy Government continues to believe that the United\nNations provides a most fitting framework for translating\ninto reality our global responsibility for the international\nprotection of human rights. It is our deep conviction that the\nSecurity Council should pay appropriate attention, and act\nresolutely and promptly, as part of its preventive actions, to\nmass infringements of human and minority rights, since they\nconstitute threats to regional and international peace and\nsecurity.\nWe should pursue an effective integration of human\nrights elements into the workings of the whole United\nNations system. Hungary supports the early establishment\nof a post of high commissioner for human rights. An\nappropriate mandate from this session of the General\nAssembly could ensure, through this new institution, an\nadequate presence for human rights elements, particularly in\nthe various fields of early warning, conflict management,\npeace-keeping and peace-making, electoral assistance and\npost-conflict peace-building. The high commissioner could\nmake the human rights activities of the United Nations more\ntransparent to world public opinion. We intend to lend our\nfull support to a mandate for the high commissioner that\nwould also cover the protection and promotion of minority\nrights. In our view, the high commissioner could also play\na major role in raising public awareness of the positive\nmodels of multinational coexistence and minority protection\nsystems that are functioning well in various democratic\ncountries of the world. Here I can refer to the previous\nspeaker, whose country, I believe, is a good example of this.\nWe believe that this task is of major importance and has\nnever been higher on the agenda than it is today. The\napplication or adaptation of these successful solutions to the\nspecific circumstances prevailing in other parts of the world\ncould greatly contribute to a more satisfactory human rights\nsituation in our world at the end of this turbulent century.\nI have obviously not exhausted all the problems\nbesetting the world. Our Governments today have an\nenormous responsibility to find answers to the new\nchallenges. If we fail to act now, we risk losing all the\nachievements won with the ending of the cold war.\n"

At a time of radical historic\ntransformation and growing interdependency in the modern\nworld, the global role and significance of the United Nations\nis growing correspondingly as a political instrument for the\nworld in the consideration and solution of common human\nproblems.\nIndependent Uzbekistan, recognized by all States, has\nnow become a full-fledged member of the United Nations.\nEmbassies of many countries and offices of various\ninternational agencies have been opened in the Republic. I\nam pleased to acknowledge the fruitful activities of the\nUnited Nations Office in Uzbekistan, the opening of which\nwas undertaken on the personal initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\nI should like to take this opportunity, on behalf of my\npeople and the Government of Uzbekistan, to express sincere\ngratitude to the United Nations and all its Member States for\ntheir recognition and support of my country\u2019s independence.\nUzbekistan, with its population of 22 million,\nconstitutes both the geographical and political basis of\nCentral Asia. One of the most ancient world civilizations\nemerged in the region, and this land was crossed by the\nGreat Silk Road. The history of my people goes back deep\ninto the past, being more than 3,000 years old. Once-\nprosperous empires and kingdoms in the territory of ancient\nTuran, Transoxania and Turkistan had a marked impact on\nthe development of world culture.\nThe cities of Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva\nhave been known far and wide since time immemorial and\nhave had trade links stretching from China to Spain and\nfrom Europe to the Indian Ocean. These cities were noted\nfor magnificent architectural structures and attracted\noutstanding thinkers, scholars and artists from all parts of the\nworld. The great Tamerlane turned Samarkand into a capital\ncity of his empire and was famous as a patron of scholars,\nphilosophers, architects, poets and musicians. Spiritual,\nintellectual and aesthetic values have had a profound effect\nin shaping the way of life and traditional culture of our\npeople. We are proud of our history and revere the memory\nof our great ancestors, the thinkers of the East: Al-Bukhari,\nAl-Termezi, Ahmad Yassavi, Bahaudin Naqshbandi,\nAl-Kworazmi, Beruni, Avicenna, Nawai, Ulugh Beg and\nmany others who made an invaluable contribution to world\ncivilization.\nHaving declared its independence, Uzbekistan has now\nentered an era of spiritual and intellectual renaissance and\nradical transformation in the economic, political and social\nspheres. We have embarked on the building of a\ndemocratic, lawful and secular society with an open-market\neconomy and a strong system of social welfare. There is\nconsent among the people of Uzbekistan on the need,\ndirections and forms of developing political institutions, and\nthere is now perceptible progress towards democratic\ntransformation. The new Fundamental Law of the Republic\nof Uzbekistan, adopted last December, has been highly\nreceived by independent international experts and meets the\nessential criteria of a democratic constitution while ensuring\nall human rights and basic freedoms of citizens. Free and\ncontested general elections have been held for Head of State\nand the Parliament. There is a clear separation of powers in\nthe country, and the multi-party system is gaining strength.\nOur people have regained their freedom following more\nthan 100 years of oppression and now have an opportunity\nto decide their own destiny, develop their culture and bring\nabout their spiritual renaissance. The Republic, inhabited by\npeople of more than 100 nations and nationalities, provides\nall ethnic groups with broad and equal opportunities for the\ndevelopment of their national cultures, traditions and\nlanguages. We are proud that, despite the difficulties of\ntransition, Uzbekistan has been able to preserve political\nstability, peace and ethnic accord.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan is a country of great\npotential, unique natural resources and a promising future.\nAbout half of its population is below the age of 18. It is\nthird in the world in cotton production, eighth in gold\nextraction, tenth in the production of copper and is among\nthe leading nations in deposits of rare metals and strategic\nraw materials. Uzbekistan possesses huge energy resources\nand has much more to offer the world market. It has long\ntraditions of craftsmanship, trade, commerce and farming\nand is a great country for tourism. The Republic has a\npowerful scientific, intellectual and spiritual potential.\nResearch carried out by our scientists in the fields of\nmathematics, physics and biology has won renown far\nbeyond the region. But our principal wealth is an open,\nhard-working, hospitable and proud people noted for its\nsense of honour and dignity.\nFree Uzbekistan has chosen its own path to reforming\nsociety and has elaborated its own model for transition to a\ndemocratic society and a free market economy. At the same\ntime, we are quite aware that the Republic - which earlier\nserved as a raw-materials appendage of the former Soviet\nUnion, exporting cheap raw materials and importing\nlow-quality finished products - with a hypertrophied\neconomy and devastated environment, can hardly be\nexpected to overcome in a short span of time the situation it\nhas inherited. Given the high birth rate, acute problems of\nemployment and considerable material difficulties, economic\nand spiritual development can be expected to outstrip\npolitical transformation. We must work out a solid legal\nfoundation, educate people in living in a law-abiding society,\nencourage tolerance of diverse views and opinions and,\nabove all, change the mentality of the people, whose outlook\nwas shaped by the command-administrative and\ntotalitarian-distributive system we lived under for the last\n74 years.\nAny other approach, or a thoughtless acceleration of\nevents, may lead to conflicts and civil confrontation in many\ncountries of the former socialist camp. As we have seen,\nsuch approaches have led to civil confrontation, inter-ethnic\nclashes and the further proliferation of problems, rather than\nto their solution, and may discredit the very idea of a free -\nmarket economy and democratic reform. This can be seen\nquite clearly from the examples of those countries that are\nnow going through a very difficult time in their history. It\nhas become evident today that there are no universal models\nof social and economic development that are equally\nacceptable to all countries. There seems to remain no\nmarked difference between the orthodox concepts of\ncapitalism and socialism. The need has emerged to shape\nnew and free thinking without ideological indoctrination,\nwhich would reveal the entire diversity of the forms and\nways for each country\u2019s transition to an entirely new\ncondition.\nTaking into consideration the concrete situation,\nmentality and traditions of the Uzbek people, we have\nproclaimed five basic principles of our reform. First, we\nhave proclaimed the priority of the economy over politics\nand the de-ideologization of both domestic and external\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3\neconomic relations. Secondly, we consider that the State\nneeds to play the role of main reformer and initiator of\ndemocratic transformation in our Republic during the\ntransition period. Thirdly, we proclaim the preservation of\nlaw and order and the supremacy of law. Fourthly, we\nbelieve it is of exceptional importance to have a strong\nsocial policy protecting the interests of all citizens, especially\nthe neediest and those requiring Government support.\nFinally, we believe the transition to free-market relations will\nhave to be carried out gradually, on an evolutionary basis.\nA popular saying in our country goes, \\\"Never destroy the old\nhouse before you have built a new one.\\\"\nSocial stability and State security are vital factors in\ndemocratic reform. Hardly any other problem can be solved\nwithout them. Uzbekistan has steadfastly and consistently\nsupported security and stability in all regions, especially in\nour own, Central Asia. The specific characteristics of our\nregion and its geopolitical situation are such that negative\ndevelopments may trigger world-wide instability. Suffice it\nto say that about 60 million people associated with various -\nand I stress, various - ethnic and religious groups live in\nCentral Asia. Both nuclear and conventional arms of\ntremendous destructive force have been accumulated in this\nregion, and any violence may result in disasters of\nunforeseeable magnitude.\nIn this connection, one cannot avoid discussing the\nsituation in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border. One\ncould argue about the political interests of the parties\ninvolved; however, there is no doubt that the bloody conflict\nin Tajikistan has arisen as a result of the unlawful efforts of\none of the sides to seize power through the force of arms\nand intimidation and maintain it on the basis of continued\nmaterial and ideological interference from the outside. Thus,\nnumerous political forces and different parts of the\npopulation have become involved in this armed conflict. It\nhas been internationalized also because financial and\nlogistical support of anti-government fighting units with\nmilitary equipment, as well as training centres, were located\nbeyond the borders of Tajikistan.\nThe Government of Uzbekistan is concerned at the\ncontinued conflict in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan\nborder, primarily because for centuries the peoples of Central\nAsia have been linked by close economic, spiritual and\ncultural relations. At the present time, there are in essence\nno real borders in the classical sense among the countries of\nthe region. That is why any outbreak of conflict for purely\ngeographical reasons may affect the whole region.\nWe are also concerned at the uncontrolled accumulation\nof modern arms in huge quantities. Where do they come\nfrom, and who is arming the extremists and terrorists? What\nis the world community doing, and what should it do to\nprevent the flow of arms into zones of fratricidal conflict?\nThese burning issues, which affect millions of people and\nentire nations, are awaiting a solution.\nThe problem of Tajik refugees has become extremely\nserious as their conflict escalates. Tens of thousands of\npeaceful people have been compelled to leave their homes.\nUzbekistan is sending food products, medicine and other\nvital necessities to Tajikistan and is encouraging the return\nof the refugees, and through the United Nations office\nsupports the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees for the rendering of humanitarian assistance.\nUzbekistan resolutely condemns extremism, terrorism,\nreligious fanaticism and fundamentalism in any form. It is\nin favour of the peaceful resolution of conflicts by political\nmeans, of holding negotiations between opposing parties, and\nof non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States,\nand it is prepared to render further humanitarian assistance\nto the Tajik people, primarily to refugees returning from\nAfghanistan. In the early stages of the conflict in Tajikistan,\nUzbekistan twice drew the attention of the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to the\nurgent need for thorough consideration of the situation and\nits settlement within the framework of the United Nations.\nWe are grateful to the United Nations and to the\nSecretary-General for their prompt response to the concern\nwe expressed and for their efforts to settle the conflict. We\nbelieve that the international community will properly\nappreciate this contribution to peace. A United Nations\nmission headed by Mr. Kittani, the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Envoy, has been working fruitfully in the region.\nData collected by the mission have, in our view, provided\nan opportunity to draw objective conclusions as to the nature\nand the driving forces of the conflict at a meeting of the\nUnited Nations Security Council.\nNevertheless, there is hardly any basis today on which\nto talk about sufficient attention being paid to the situation\non the Tajik-Afghan border in the light of the current\nsituation in Tajikistan as well as in Afghanistan. We have\nnot understood the scale and potential of this conflict and its\nglobally devastating consequences. I should like to take this\nopportunity to appeal to participants in this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to express their constructive views on\nways of solving this problem.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nUzbekistan would welcome the convening of a standing\nUnited Nations seminar on security, stability and cooperation\nin Central Asia. Tashkent, a city with peacemaking\ntraditions, steeped in the spirit of international cooperation\nand ethnic accord, is prepared to be the venue for this\nseminar. In accordance with Article 52 of the United\nNations Charter, the parties involved could discuss, within\nthe framework of the United Nations seminar, the\npossibilities of setting up an effective system of regional\nsecurity in Central Asia.\nSuch a system could contemplate measures for the\npreservation and restoration of peace in case of conflicts and\nwars, including collective sanctions of a diplomatic,\nfinancial, economic and other nature against those who\ntoday would venture to violate peace and existing borders,\nand produce recommendations for the United Nations on the\nestablishment of stability and lasting peace in this region.\nUzbekistan supports the idea of a new role for the\nUnited Nations as a global institution in safeguarding\nsecurity on Earth, which was advanced by the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nin his \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" (A/47/277), which he outlined\nin the Security Council on 31 January 1992. We invite the\nSecretary-General to pay a visit to the Central Asian region,\nincluding the Republic of Uzbekistan. I am sure that the\nauthority of the United Nations and the Secretary-General\nwill make it possible to prevent the negative development of\nevents in the region.\nIn \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali\nattaches great importance to preventive diplomacy in today\u2019s\nworld, which coincides fully with our own view. From this\nlofty international rostrum, I wish to call upon the United\nNations to strengthen further its peacemaking work,\nspecifically in zones of emerging conflicts.\nIt must unfortunately be admitted that, in many cases,\nauthoritative international agencies react to conflict situations\nnot when - speaking figuratively - they smell smoke, but\nonly afterwards, when the fire has already flared up and is\nalmost impossible to put out. To prevent the escalation of\nconflicts, the international community should abandon the\nrole of passive observer it so often plays and instead adopt\nthe stance of an active peacemaker.\nIt would be expedient in this regard to establish a\nspecial group under the United Nations Security Council to\nanalyse and forecast emerging international conflicts for the\npurpose of rapidly preparing recommendations for the\nSecurity Council, other United Nations agencies and the\nworld community so that the necessary measures can be\ntaken.\nCurrent realities in the world today show that the\nsecurity of one nation cannot be guaranteed at the expense\nof another State and that regional security can be viewed\nsolely in concert with global security. On this basis,\nUzbekistan is in favour of the total abolition of nuclear\nweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons will have to become a more efficient treaty,\nunrestricted by any time limits. Our Republic will actively\nparticipate in preliminary negotiations for the preparation of\na conference on the prolongation of this Treaty. Uzbekistan\nis a staunch supporter of proclaiming Central Asia a\nnuclear-free zone.\nWe are firmly determined also to hold negotiations on\nsigning the chemical weapons Convention. Uzbekistan\nconsiders that we need international control over the\nproliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons in\nCentral Asia.\nI should like to draw particular attention, among other\ntop-priority problems, to the question of stepping up our\ncommon efforts against narcobusiness. We would like to see\na large-scale cooperation in the struggle against this scourge,\nthis white death. It is a secret to no one that a large\npercentage of the narcotics consumed throughout the world\nare produced in and transported through Central Asia.\nConcentration of narcobusiness in a single region alone\nprovides sufficient ground for the world community to focus\nits efforts on the elimination of this horrible business.\nUzbekistan is ready to cooperate in this area with all\ninterested countries and organizations. We would welcome\nthe establishment, under the aegis of the United Nations, of\na regional commission on Central Asia for the coordination\nof joint efforts in the fight against narcobusiness.\nWe also favour greater United Nations involvement in\ncontrolling the environment and preventing global ecological\ndisasters, and we are ready to facilitate the implementation\nof that noble mission by all available means.\nLike so many regions of the planet, Central Asia faces\nan ecological disaster on an unprecedented scale. First and\nforemost, there is the tragedy of the Aral Sea. In recent\nyears it has lost two thirds of its volume, its water table has\nshrunk by half and its shoreline has retreated 80 kilometers,\nthe content of mineral salts has increased fourfold, 2 million\nhectares of arable land have become desert, and sandstorms\nrange at distances greater than 300 kilometers from it. All\nthis adversely affects the sanitary and health situation in the\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5\nregion. In its ecological and socio-economic consequences,\nthe problem of the Aral Sea, according to United Nations\nexperts, is one of the major calamities of the twentieth\ncentury.\nThe death of the Aral Sea may have unpredictable\naffects the whole world. We appeal to the world community\nto render assistance in saving the Aral Sea and the adjoining\nzone. In light of the global nature of this disaster,\nUzbekistan would appreciate the establishment of a United\nNations special commission on the Aral Sea which, in\ncoordination with the region\u2019s Governments, and through\nUnited Nations channels, would attract international\nresources and opportunities for the solution of this ecological\ntragedy. As a first step, this commission could hold an\ninternational conference under United Nations aegis in\nNukus, bordering on the Aral Sea.\nUzbekistan became independent at the end of the cold\nwar. This new epoch requires a new and sober assessment\nof all problems facing the United Nations and the world\ncommunity. We are concerned by the growing suspicion\nbetween the advanced countries of the North and the\ndeveloping countries of the South. We regret that the former\nideological intolerance between East and West is now being\nreplaced by ethnic and religious intolerance. We are also\nconcerned about the growing trend towards fundamentalism,\nextremism and terrorism.\nIn our view, under the circumstances, the United\nNations should be the world\u2019s principal tool for the\nprevention of new hotbeds of confrontation which could\njeopardize human progress. We believe that urgent and\neffective measures are now necessary so that a key organ of\nthe United Nations - the Security Council - can adequately\nreflect the socio-economic, ethno-cultural, religious and\nspiritual diversity of today\u2019s world; its currently conservative\nstructure should be reconsidered.\nThe world\u2019s nations are on the threshold of a new\nmillennium. They want to face a bright, promising future\nand leave behind the cataclysms of past global ideological\nconfrontation. There is growing conviction that there is no\nalternative to peace, cooperation and universal security.\nWhat will the future of mankind be like? What kind of\nnew era is opening? Will it succeed in overcoming the\nheavy legacy of the past? Will it achieve openness and\nsincerity in inter-State relations, eliminating mutual\nsuspicion, distrust and diktat, particularly the latter? The\nfuture of the community of nations depends on the answers\nto these questions. Uzbekistan is determined to progress\nsteadily towards the achievement of its national objectives,\nin harmony with the common interests of the world\ncommunity and the deep democratic processes that\ncharacterize the current level of its development. The Uzbek\npeople are aware that hard times still lie ahead but they are\nassured of a great future in the single family of mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency\nof the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly and to\nexpress our conviction that your experience and diplomatic\nskills will make a valuable contribution to the work of this\naugust body. My delegation will spare no effort to support\nyou in the fulfilment of your tasks. I should also like to\navail myself of this opportunity to thank your predecessor,\nMr. Stoyan Ganev, for the way he conducted the work of the\nGeneral Assembly during a difficult period.\nOver the last eight months, this Organization has been\nable to welcome six new Member States: Slovakia, the\nCzech Republic, The Former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia, Monaco, Eritrea and Andorra, thus enhancing\nthe universality of the United Nations.\nSince the last session of the General Assembly we have\nbeen witness to historic gains in regional disputes. The\nsigning of the peace agreement between Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization is a unique breakthrough\nand will, it is hoped, lead to a just and lasting peace for the\nregion. When the President of the African National\nCongress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, spoke in this Hall on 24\nSeptember, he outlined the historic advances made towards\ndemocracy in South Africa. We are very hopeful that a new\nSouth Africa will play a vital role in the development of the\nAfrican continent.\nMy country was admitted to the United Nations on\n18 September 1990 and has tried over the last three years to\nmaintain as active a presence and participation as possible.\nWhile Liechtenstein was the 160th Member in 1990, the\nOrganization today has 184 members. This considerable\nincrease in the Organization\u2019s membership makes it clear\nthat the ongoing discussion of equitable representation on\nand expansion of the Security Council\u2019s membership is\ntimely and necessary.\nIn our view, the priorities in reforming the Security\nCouncil are cohesion and effectiveness. It is of great\nimportance, however, that the discussion of reforms also\ninclude the question of the Security Council\u2019s work, since\nbroad support for its actions is an indispensable condition of\nits legitimacy, which can only be guaranteed by enhanced\ntransparency and cooperation with other Member States.\nArticle 23 of the Charter establishes that the contribution to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security is the\nfirst criterion for membership in the Council; it is obvious\nthat the second criterion - equitable geographical distribution\n- has so far not been given due attention. In view of the\nobvious importance of the Security Council\u2019s composition,\nwe favour taking the necessary time to make adjustments\nbeneficial to the credibility of the Organization as a whole.\nThe new effectiveness of the Security Council is\nmanifested, among other ways, by the recent considerable\nincrease of peace-keeping and peacemaking missions. These\noperations are closely observed by the public and are often\ntaken as a yardstick for the activities of the United Nations\nas a whole. While we think it important to give more\nattention to other fields, such as that of social development,\nwe are aware of the impact that the failure or success of\npeace-keeping activities can have on the credibility of the\nOrganization. In our view, the United Nations should not\nengage in an ever-increasing number of peace-keeping\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 9\nmissions all over the world. A more important role should\nbe given to preventive diplomacy, which can be carried out\nby regional organizations or arrangements such as the\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).\nThe participating States consider the CSCE a regional\narrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United\nNations Charter, and as such it provides an important link\nbetween European and global security. Liechtenstein, as a\nparticipating State, believes that enhancement of the\ncooperation with the CSCE is crucial; my country favours\nthe idea of granting observer status to that organization and\nhas supported the request for the inclusion of an additional\nitem to this effect in the agenda of the forty-eighth session.\nPreventive diplomacy cannot, however, replace peace-\nkeeping, and the United Nations must remain as active in\nthat field as is necessary. It must be pointed out that the\nexisting infrastructure in New York is not sufficient to cope\nwith the wide range of tasks, and urgently needs to be\nimproved.\nDeplorable events in the recent past have made it clear\nthat there is not sufficient protection of civil and military\npersonnel involved in peace-keeping missions. We therefore\nwholeheartedly welcome the inclusion of a new agenda item\nproposed by the delegation of New Zealand regarding the\nquestion of responsibility for attacks on United Nations and\nassociated personnel and measures to ensure that those\nresponsible for such attacks are brought to justice.\nWith the growing involvement of the United Nations in\ncomplex conflicts, the Organization\u2019s role has been\ntransformed into a more active and comprehensive one. As\na result, relief workers expose their lives to great risk in\ntheir efforts to alleviate human suffering. My delegation\nbelieves that it simply cannot be tolerated that relief workers,\nwho themselves want to save lives, should become targets.\nThe United Nations should make it very clear that these acts\nof violence will not go unpunished. The emblems of the\nUnited Nations, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent must be\nrespected.\nHumanitarian assistance today faces the challenge of\nmany complex emergency situations. These challenges must\nbe met on the basis of the principles of neutrality,\nimpartiality and humanity; humanitarian aid must not be\npoliticized. When we are called upon to give proof of our\nsolidarity, we must provide the necessary financial means.\nWe are, however, also called upon to address the root causes\nof many disasters, such as poverty, population increase and\ncivil and ethnic strife. Imbalances feed misery; they not\nonly are unfair but are dangerous.\nForty-five years after the adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a great deal remains to be\ndone in this field, to which we attach particular importance.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 was\na very important event, and we all know how difficult it was\nto adopt the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.\nThis text can constitute a milestone in the history of the\nUnited Nations only if it is followed by determined action by\nthe General Assembly in the spirit of the Vienna\nDeclaration. In our view, it is of the utmost importance that\nthe the Centre for Human Rights be given the resources\nnecessary to enable it to carry out its tasks even more\nefficiently. In addition, the creation of the post of high\ncommissioner for human rights is a laudable initiative, and\nthe General Assembly should provide him or her with a\nstrong mandate within the already existing structures.\nIt is a well-known fact that the financial situation of the\nUnited Nations is disastrous. In his speech of 26 August,\nthe Secretary-General accordingly outlined initial steps to\ncope with this crisis. The measures taken by the Secretary-\nGeneral seem to be unavoidable, and we hope they will not\nhave a negative impact on the work of the General\nAssembly. In our view, urgent action by the General\nAssembly is needed to prevent further deterioration, which\ncould have serious consequences. Punctual and full payment\nof the assessed contributions must be made by all States and\narrears must be paid in full and promptly. Proposals aimed\nat ensuring proper utilization of resources and establishing\nadequate accountability within the United Nations should be\ndiscussed thoroughly and expeditiously. Finally, an overall\nreform of the financial sector seems to be necessary. All\nsuggestions which might contribute to this aim, especially\nthose contained in the so-called Volcker-Ogata report, should\nbe studied with due attention.\nMuch has been said about the changes that have taken\nplace since the ending of the cold war. Unfortunately we\ncannot say that all these changes have been positive. To the\ninfinite regret and dismay of the whole international\ncommunity, we have continued to witness the outbreak of a\ngreat number of ethnic and national conflicts, accompanied\nby the untold suffering of innocent people. There must be\na better way for the world to manage its affairs. While\ntensions within and between communities may be an\ninevitable part of the human condition, it is, in our view, of\nthe utmost importance that ways be found to defuse them\npeacefully and without bloodshed.\nIn this context, I should like to refer briefly again to an\nidea which might take us a step in the right direction and\nwhich I introduced when I had the great honour to address\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nthe General Assembly for the first time at its forty-sixth\nsession, very soon after Liechtenstein became a Member of\nthe United Nations. On that occasion, I ventured to suggest\nthat a basis for some solutions could be found within the\nprinciple of self-determination. The value of this great\nprinciple has been fully demonstrated in the traditional\ncontext of decolonization. But it need not be limited to that\ncontext. Applied also to communities within States, and\nallowing for them to have different levels of autonomy\naccording to the particular circumstances of different\ncommunities, it could perhaps defuse many of the tensions\nwhich are such a potent source of conflict. Such principles,\nplaced within a suitable framework, would give an effective\nand practical dimension to the principle of self-determination\nwhich it has sometimes seemed to lack. Eventually such\nprovisions could perhaps come to be elaborated in a\nconvention to be of general application.\nSince first putting those thoughts before this Assembly,\nwe in Liechtenstein have been encouraged by the degree of\ninterest which has been shown in them. Our ideas are\nflexible, although our objective - which is to find practical\nand effective ways of avoiding, or at least reducing, tensions\nbetween communities - remains firm. We have refined our\ninitial thoughts on the subject in the light of comments made\nby others, and we developed our ideas further at the last\nsession of the General Assembly, both during debates in the\nThird Committee and when the Head of Government\naddressed the Assembly in the course of the general debate.\nOn that occasion, the Head of Government announced\nthat the Government of Liechtenstein would be inviting each\nGovernment represented in the Assembly, including\nObservers, to nominate an independent expert to attend an\ninformal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein to discuss these\nmatters further. That meeting took place from 16 to 18\nMarch this year, attended by participants nominated by 46\nStates and international and non-governmental organizations.\nI attended it myself throughout, and can say personally how\nvaluable we found the contributions participants made to the\ndevelopment of our thinking. Perhaps I might be allowed to\ntake this opportunity to thank them all for their participation\nin what we see as an important and valuable project.\nOver the past two years we have, in these various ways,\ncarried forward our belief that, in the ideas first put forward\nto Assembly in 1991, the international community may find\nsome way forward in its search for ways of avoiding the\nkind of internal conflicts which cause ever-increasing human\nsuffering and which are increasingly dangerous for the peace\nand safety of our world. To make further progress we\ndecided this year to seek to inscribe an item on the\nAssembly\u2019s agenda which would enable our ideas to be fully\ndiscussed by the full membership of the United Nations. We\nare grateful that our proposal was accepted and now appears\non the agenda for this session as item 108 (b), entitled\n\\\"Right of peoples to self-determination: Effective realization\nof the right of self-determination through autonomy\\\". We\nlook forward to the debate which will follow, and I hope to\nbe able to participate myself in at least part of it. We hope\nthat in the light of what may be said in the debate, the\nAssembly will agree that there is, in the ideas which we\nhave put forward, something valuable which merits further\nconsideration and elaboration.\nWe do not underestimate the difficulties ahead. We are\naware of the sensitivities of this whole subject, especially in\nthese times. Great though those difficulties and sensitivities\nmay be for some States, we are convinced that the needs of\nthe international community are even more pressing. The\ndangers, horrors and suffering to which tensions between\ncommunities within States can give rise, and of which we\nsadly have daily reminders, make it essential for the\ninternational community to make every effort to open up\nnew thinking in this field in order to find practical and\neffective means for further promoting the principles and\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe consider it a great privilege to have an Organization\nsuch as the United Nations, founded upon a Charter which\nencompasses the highest ideals of humankind. I wish to take\nthis opportunity to reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to the\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on behalf of Venezuela, to extend\nto you, Sir, our very special congratulations on your election\nas President of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth\nsession. It is of great significance to us that the Permanent\nRepresentative of Guyana - a country with which we\nmaintain special relations of friendship and cooperation -\nshould be directing the work of this important Assembly.\nThe President of Venezuela, Mr. Ramon J. Vel\u00e1squez, would\nhave liked to be present on this important occasion.\nHowever, the current situation in the country necessitates his\nremaining in Caracas.\nIn recent months Venezuela has had to assume\nexceptional responsibilities. Yesterday marked the end of\nour term as president of the Security Council. During that\nterm, events of vital importance have taken place in the\nworld. In particular, during the past 12 months we have\nwitnessed with horror the re-emergence of hatreds, barbarism\nand episodes of ethnic cleansing that we thought had been\nconsigned for ever to the saddest and blackest pages of\nhistory. In the conflict that is tearing apart the former\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, Venezuela has played an important\nrole - a role widely recognized by the other members of the\nCouncil - in the protection of human rights. Acting within\nthe framework of the international bodies, we have sought,\nabove all, to restore peace to that tormented region.\nThe United Nations has accumulated a wealth of\nexperience in the deployment of operations for the\nmaintenance of order - even in some situations in which\npeace had not yet been attained. With the new situation in\nthe world, an organization that was established for purposes\nof dialogue and negotiation is faced with challenges of a\ndifferent kind. From the maintenance of order in a\ntraditional sense, it has moved on to operations that include\nmilitary aspects, humanitarian, institutional and electoral\nassistance, the monitoring of human-rights issues and even\ndevelopment aid. In recent months the United Nations has\nplayed an active and varied role against an ever-changing\ninternational background.\nThis year, too, the world has seen the emergence of new\nhopes. In one of the most strife-torn regions of the planet,\nwhere there appeared to be no prospect of understanding or\nfuture coexistence, two old enemies, the State of Israel and\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, have taken significant\nsteps towards a joint search for peace and the harmonious\ndevelopment of the two peoples. Venezuela welcomes the\nWashington agreement between Israel and the PLO, and will\nwork within the framework of the United Nations to achieve\na body of measures and resolutions that will help to erase\nthe hatreds of a past that is still too close. Similarly, we\nsupport the peace initiatives and the process of\ndemilitarization and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\nthat have always been an essential part of the work of this\nAssembly.\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 9\nDuring our months on the Security Council, we have\nexperienced, at first hand, the accelerated pace of world\nevents today. We are concerned at the uncertainty of the\nroads to be taken and the instability that prevails in many\ncorners of the world. There are no longer any ideologies,\nestablished values or clear directions. Nevertheless, amidst\nall the confusion a few issues have emerged which could\nbecome the single prevalent ideology of mankind. These are\nhuman rights, the defence of democracy and the protection\nof the environment.\nLast June, in Vienna, the United Nations sponsored that\nremarkable encounter, the World Conference on Human\nRights. We engaged there in a fruitful dialogue between\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations, with the\naim of working together to wipe out the injustices that still\nexist in our countries. In Vienna, we came to realize that\nthe protection of human rights has become a topic of interest\nto people of different races from all parts of the world. The\nConference confirmed the universal value of those rights and\nreaffirmed that democracy, human rights and development\nare equally important and mutually reinforcing objectives.\nThe further improvement of democracy might begin in\nthis Organization, where the reform of the Security Council\ncontinues to be necessary in order to make its decisions\nmore representative. The General Assembly must attach the\nproper importance to the discussion of this issue. Venezuela\nshares the general concern with making the United Nations\na more transparent and democratic Organization. The new\ninternational scenario calls for a more representative Security\nCouncil without exclusive rights that discriminate against\nsome Member States.\nIn the context of the defence of democracy, the United\nNations and regional organizations have made outstanding\nefforts, especially in Haiti, where it is our hope that the\nlawfully constituted Government will be restored, and in\nGuatemala, where forces attempting a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat were\ndefeated by the weight of civil society. Today, democratic\nregimes prevail in almost all of Latin America. However,\nour democracies are still young and have experienced\ndifficulties in recent months.\nIn Venezuela, we have overcome a severe political\ncrisis which undoubtedly had the result of strengthening our\ninstitutions. Following a process which took place entirely\nwithin the framework of the law, Mr. Ram\u00f3n J. Vel\u00e1squez\nsucceeded to the highest office. He is a distinguished\nhistorian, respected by all political forces in the country for\nthe honesty he has shown in his career and for his profound\nknowledge of the Venezuelan mentality.\nDemocracy is a system of values within which respect\nfor institutions is not only a duty but a necessity. There\nhave always been attempts in Latin America to justify the\nuse of force. Order, the fight against terrorism or\ncommunism, the inefficiency of the State: these reasons\nhave often been used to justify regimes that, finally, did not\nre-establish order but abolished freedom. In the past, this\nhas happened in Venezuela. Today, we have the serenity of\nwaiting for our institutions to function, and we can now say\nwith pride that democracy persists in Venezuela and that we\nhave been able to overcome a serious political crisis.\nNevertheless, our future is clouded by economic\ndifficulties. The defence and maintenance of democracy\nrequires the full cooperation of the industrialized countries\nin the search for a form of economic development that will\nafford our impoverished peoples a life of dignity. Hence,\nwe support the proposal by the President of the General\nAssembly, Mr. Samuel Insanally, for a summit to discuss the\nworld\u2019s economic problems and agree on programmes of\naction to solve them. We agree that the \\\"Agenda for Peace\\\"\nput forward by the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, should be complemented by an\nagenda for development which would place socio-economic\nproblems on the same level as those of a purely political\nnature. The establishment and preservation of democracy\ninvolves reaching a balanced and equitable global growth\nrate.\nBalanced growth was the central topic of the first\nsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development in\nNew York. The establishment of that Commission is one of\nthe most significant outcomes of the Earth Summit in Rio de\nJaneiro. There is an intimate link between the issue of\ndevelopment, the financial resources required in order to\nattain it and the strict protection of the environment. Despite\nthe lack of encouraging results, we still believe firmly in the\nRio Declaration on Environment and Development, and we\nwish to draw particular attention to Principles 3 and 4, which\nread as follows:\nPrinciple 3:\n\\\"The right to development must be fulfilled so as to\nequitably meet developmental and environmental needs\nof present and future generations.\\\"\nPrinciple 4:\n\\\"In order to achieve sustainable development,\nenvironmental protection shall constitute an\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nintegral part of the development process and\ncannot be considered in isolation from it.\\\"\nAccordingly, we are greatly concerned at what is\nhappening on Venezuela\u2019s Amazonian border. My country\nhas attached very special importance to the preservation of\nnature. Fully 17 per cent of our territory consists of\nspecially protected national parks in which economic\nactivities are closely monitored and restricted. On the\nsouthern border, in particular, we have had the support of\nscientific organizations and universities in the establishment\nof the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, covering\nan area of 60,000 square kilometres. In this zone, by law,\neconomic activities must be compatible with the fragility of\nthe tropical forest ecosystem. Particular importance is\nattached to the cultural and linguistic heritage of the\nindigenous peoples, whose way of life has always been\ncompatible with preservation of the environment.\nOver the past five years, unfortunately, we have\nundergone a true invasion whose results are disastrous for\nthe environment and which has introduced a climate of\nviolence hitherto unknown in the area.\nThe cause is illegal mining, which, while taking\nadvantage of the forested and inaccessible nature of\nAmazonia, is destroying rivers and whole hectares of\nvegetation. This phenomenon has reached a scale large\nenough to cause concern, to the point that it is escaping\ncontrol by the States. Just recently - last July - illegal\nminers massacred a group of Venezuelans, of the Yanomami\ntribe. Brazil and Venezuela, where the criminal act was\ncarried out, have established an ad hoc commission to\ninvestigate the facts and to make sure that the criminals are\npunished. But the fact that these events can occur gives a\nclear idea of the seriousness of the situation we are facing in\nAmazonia. Trees are being cut down, the sources of our\ngreat rivers are being deforested, the waters of the great\ntropical forest are being polluted with mercury and the\nindigenous population, the original inhabitants of the region,\nare being murdered.\nThe Amazonian border of Venezuela, 2,200 kilometres\nlong, has been preserved. On our side there is the biosphere\nreserve, and in Brazil there is the Yanomami park,\nestablished in 1992 and covering 94,000 square kilometres.\nNevertheless, the deaths of the indigenous Venezuelans show\nthat violence and destruction are beginning to penetrate these\nprotected areas. Illegal mining is a business behind which\nare the gold and diamond transnationals that arm them,\nprovide them with machinery and build landing strips in the\nforest. They are deforesting Amazonia. Each year an area\nof forest the size of Portugal is destroyed. They are wiping\nout plants and animals: it is estimated that\n1,200,000 species will disappear in the next 25 years. They\nare annihilating the local population, and this in 1993, when\nthe whole world is commemorating the International Year\nfor the World\u2019s Indigenous People.\nTherefore, Venezuela addresses the international\ncommunity to denounce this serious environmental situation.\nAll the countries of the Amazon Basin have clearly\nproclaimed our sovereignty over the land in question.\nAmazonia belongs to us, but we have the responsibility to\nprotect it, now and for future generations. We must work\ntogether to preserve our tropical forest. Each country in the\nregion is making special efforts to take up the challenge of\nsustainable development in this zone where the ecological\nbalance is so precarious. We particularly welcome the\nestablishment in Brazil of the Ministry of the Environment\nand the Conservation of Amazonia, which will undoubtedly\nbe an important factor in solving the problem. Only open\nand sincere dialogue between the countries of the region will\nenable us to resist the gold and diamond multinationals that\nare destroying, without regard for morality, this important\npart of the heritage of mankind.\nWe must live up to the environmental commitments\nentered into at the Rio Summit. We need technical support\nand political, economic and social backing to confront the\neconomic interests that are destroying our heritage. I appeal\nto the mining transnationals to understand that development\ndoes not mean destruction; to international agencies to help\nus implement the principles of sustainable development in\nthis zone; and to the wealthiest countries to understand that,\nwhile poverty and ignorance persist among large segments\nof the population in Latin America, violence and\nenvironmental destruction will continue.\nThe United Nations has performed a monumental task\nin convening the Earth Summit and the Conference on\nHuman Rights, and now the major meetings on population\nand social development. The resolutions adopted at these\nconferences are now being violated in Amazonia. Venezuela\nis making a great effort to ensure the preservation of the\nenvironment, often in areas to which access is extremely\ndifficult. We are fighting for human rights among people\nwho are not accustomed to respecting the law. We are\ntrying to proceed in accordance with the principles of\nsustainable development, standing up to the companies that\nare seeking only to extract the wealth of the soil at a rapid\npace. These are difficult tasks, but we are convinced that\nthis effort is necessary in order to conserve our Amazonia\nand preserve it for future generations of our peoples and also\nForty-eighth session - 1 October l993 11\nfor future generations of all mankind. The United Nations\nis the appropriate forum for the whole world to learn of our\nefforts to preserve this territory, its biodiversity and the\nintegrity of its rightful inhabitants.\n"

        "file_text": "In addressing this Assembly for the first time, I\nam pleased to extend to you, Sir, the congratulations of the\ndelegation of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,\nwhich I have the honour to head, on your outstanding\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nforty-eighth session. In our view, your moral and\nintellectual qualities and your extensive experience in\ninternational affairs are clear guarantees of the success of\nour work. I assure you that my delegation is fully prepared\nto assist you as you undertake your noble mission.\nI should like to join those representatives who have\ncongratulated your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, on his effective leadership of the Assembly during\nits forty-seventh session.\nLet me take this opportunity also to express a warm\nwelcome to the new States Members of the Organization.\nThe multifaceted action of the United Nations over the\nnumerous years of its existence has given us a true\nappreciation of the institution\u2019s major role, as well as of the\nworth of the men who, during that time, have borne the\nresponsibility for it. This is why my delegation expresses\nsatisfaction at seeing Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the head\nof the Organization. We pay a resounding tribute to him for\nhis dedication and determination to work for peace and the\nwell-being of mankind.\nForty-eight years after its creation, and despite a\nparticularly difficult international situation, our Organization\nis still struggling to discharge properly the lofty and onerous\nmission entrusted to it. Equally, with the passage of time,\nits activity has escalated and become more diversified.\nUnfortunately, we are today obliged to note that the United\nNations is increasingly confronted by enormous financial\ndifficulties, which hamper its proper functioning. The\nfinancial crisis that it is experiencing stems primarily from\nthe crushing imbalance between its various tasks and its\nscanty financial means.\nThus, in the area of peace-keeping, the United Nations\nis responsible for numerous rather costly operations, while,\nin several regions of the world, hotbeds of tension and\nincreasing instability seem to presage other difficult\nsituations that are likely to transcend the boundaries of the\nOrganization\u2019s ordinary or traditional role. The task is huge,\nand we must not remain passive in the face of such\nsuffering. It is therefore up to all Member States to\ncontribute effectively to securing an improvement in the\nOrganization\u2019s peace-keeping system.\nWhile, within the framework of the work of this forty-\neighth session, we are still reviewing a multitude of\nproblems to which we must find solutions, let us recognize\nthat the session does have the advantage of being held at a\ntime when, for the first time in more than 40 years, we are\nseeing encouraging and promising results with regard to the\ndevelopments in respect of the problem of Palestine.\nThe Government of the Comoros would like, through\nme, to congratulate the signatories of the Washington\nagreement. It provides grounds for hope that this mutual\n\nrecognition and the autonomy of certain territories represent\nan unquestionable guarantee of the establishment of a\nsovereign and independent Palestinian State, so that this part\nof the world, which for so long has been disrupted by war,\ncan finally experience peace and stability. We pay a well-\ndeserved tribute to the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization for his perseverance in defending the rights of\nthe brotherly Palestinian people, whose just struggle we have\nalways supported.\nIn the same context, my country has great hopes for the\nnegotiations between the South African authorities and the\nrepresentatives of the black majority. My country sincerely\nhopes that these negotiations will culminate in the\nestablishment of a truly united, multiracial and democratic\nSouth African society.\nIt is clear that action by the various United Nations\nauthorities has made a considerable contribution to\nstrengthening the credibility of our Organization and the\nconfidence the international community has in it. On the\nother hand, the rebirth of democracy in Eastern Europe, the\nopening up of Africa to a multiparty system and the\nrelaxation of tensions among the super-Powers are also\nfactors which should give us hope for a better world. But\nhow can we not be concerned or doubtful when in some\nparts of the world there are still hotbeds of tension and\nfratricidal wars? In fact, the deterioration of the situation in\nSomalia, with all its consequences, in particular the mass\ndisplacement of the population and the murder of those who\nare defending peace, calls for ever greater vigilance and\nsolidarity on our part. It is time for the international\ncommunity to take effective action with a view to the\nholding of a conference of national reconciliation to put an\nend to this war. It is also crucial that States and\ninternational organizations continue to render their valuable\nassistance to these peoples, who are in dire need.\nWith regard to Africa, I am concerned about our\nneighbours in Mozambique, in Angola, in Liberia and in all\nof these countries where human dignity and conscience are\nbeing jeopardized, where, unfortunately, dialogue is yielding\nto force and violence. The Federal Islamic Republic of the\nComoros is launching a fraternal appeal to these countries to\nconsider the consequences of these wars for the future of\ntheir peoples and of Africa as a whole, and hopes that reason\nwill finally prevail.\nMoreover, we are still deeply concerned at the present\nsituation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The\nexternal aggression perpetrated against this independent and\nsovereign State requires that our Organization, and in\nparticular the Security Council, the major organ responsible\nfor the maintenance of peace, take the necessary action to\nsave that country. We fully support the resolutions of the\nSecurity Council concerning this problem, in particular\nresolution 859 (1993), in which it called\n\\\"for an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities\nthroughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as\nessential for achieving a just and equitable political\nsolution to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nthrough peaceful negotiations\\\".\nOn the other hand, the Federal Islamic Republic of the\nComoros is supporting the efforts of our Organization to find\na lasting solution to the Korean problem. My country urges\nthe parties involved to implement measures to facilitate the\nreunification of this country, whose people have suffered for\nso long from being divided.\nEnvironmental problems are a concern of the\ninternational community, which is aware of the adverse\nconsequences of the destruction of the ozone layer and the\ndeterioration of the ecological milieu. It is in this spirit that\nour States are adopting strategies and policies aimed at\nsafeguarding the environment. Convinced that one cannot\nseparate the environment from development, our\nGovernments must establish procedures and devise national\nframeworks which will give priority to sustainable\ndevelopment, in accordance with the recommendations of the\nRio Conference. Along these lines, the Federal Islamic\nRepublic of the Comoros, with a view to combating the\nproblems of pollution, deforestation and the destruction of\nnatural species, has given priority in its development plan to\nthe preservation of the environment and its natural resources.\nAnother area to which we should devote specific\ninterest is that of human rights. By the adoption of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1948,\nthe international community, through the General Assembly\nof our Organization, for the first time in the history of\nmankind, shouldered the permanent responsibility of\npublicizing and championing human rights. Today more\nthan ever before, we continue to have confidence in our\nOrganization, which has always known how to stress the\nconcept of fundamental human rights and freedoms and has\nmade ensuring them one of its fundamental goals. It is\ntherefore important for the United Nations to give priority to\nhuman rights programmes. There is also a need, within the\nframework of national policy, to implement and create\ninstitutional conditions that would guarantee respect for\nhuman dignity.\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held recently\nin Vienna, Austria, allowed the international community to\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 3\nreaffirm its unswerving dedication to respect for inalienable\nhuman rights. However, it is our Organization that must see\nto the implementation of the Vienna recommendations.\nWe cannot separate the concept of human rights from\nthe concept of democracy, for we cannot conceive of a\ndemocracy that would ignore or fail to guarantee human\nrights and freedoms. This is why our Organization should\nshow particular interest in the changes taking place\nthroughout the world, changes which are, inter alia, reflected\nin the collapse of dictatorships and the emergence of\ndemocratic political regimes. The United Nations must\nencourage and support actions aimed at advancing the\ndemocratic process.\nAs members are aware, the wind of freedom and\ndemocracy that has wafted through the world has spared no\ncontinent. Thus, in the Federal Islamic Republic of the\nComoros, the time has come for democracy and a multiparty\nsystem. We have engaged in a revision of our Constitution\nin order to adapt it to the realities of today\u2019s world, with the\nactive participation of all national political movements. We\nare moving towards legislative and regional elections to give\nthe country all the institutions required by a State of law.\nYou will agree with me, Mr. President, that this\ntransitional stage of our young democracy is difficult. We\nare, however, aware that it must be passed through in order\nto achieve a harmonization of the democratic process as a\nwhole. The Government of the Islamic Federal Republic of\nthe Comoros, concerned for the well-being of its people, is\nsparing no effort to create conditions which promote respect\nfor human dignity and the maintenance of political and\nsocial stability in the country.\nSuch an undertaking requires the assistance of peace-\nand progress-loving countries and organizations, to help our\ncountry effectively manage these freedoms, and to place our\nyoung democracy on a solid foundation.\nWe cannot close this political chapter without recalling\nanother problem, a non-violent one, certainly but no less\nimportant: that of the Comorian island of Mayotte. This\nquestion will be the subject of a debate in the Assembly, as\nit is at each of our regular sessions. That is why I will spare\nthe Assembly a list of the facts behind this thorny issue.\nBut I express again the full readiness of the Government of\nHis Excellency\nMr. Said Mohamed Djohar and the Comorian people to give\nthe highest priority to dialogue and concerted action to\nresolve this regrettable dispute which we have had with\nFrance since we attained our sovereignty.\nThere is no need to emphasize that the new\ninternational political landscape at the end of the century\nmakes the interdependence of peoples and the solidarity of\nnations the irreplaceable and only means by which we can\nguarantee the economic and social development of our\nStates.\nUnfortunately, international economic relations are still\nmarked by the bipolar attitude responsible for the growing\ngap between rich and poor countries. We must now change\nthis attitude - an outcome of the cold war - as a result of\nwhich the rich have been becoming even richer and the poor\neven poorer, and create harmonious conditions for global\neconomic relations. We believe in the ideals of peace and\nsecurity, but we are firmly convinced that they cannot be\nfully achieved if famine, malnutrition, disease and natural\ndisasters continue to be the lot of the majority of the States\nwhich make up the international community.\nThe future of the developing countries continues to be\na priority of the various specialized institutions of our\nOrganization, but the failure of various development\nprogrammes and strategies initiated in our respective\ncountries is no secret. That fact compels us to give thought\ntogether to ways and means to relaunch a different type of\ndevelopment, of which our Organization must be the\ncatalyst.\nThe advent of a new economic world order is more\nlikely today than yesterday, despite a crisis that is weakening\nthe financial Powers, de facto reducing their capacity to give\ndevelopment assistance. We understand the new obligations\nof the big Powers, faced with unemployment, reduced\nproductivity and the need to support the new States born of\nthe fragmentation of the eastern bloc. But it is up to them\nto give a new impetus to vertical cooperation, in order to\nenable the countries of the South to extricate themselves\nfrom chaos.\nIn that spirit, the developing countries have indeed\nlearned the lesson that they must rely on themselves first and\nforemost. This is why, from Africa to the Orient, structures\nare emerging whose objective is to assure regional economic\nintegration. The establishment of the African Economic\nCommunity will meet Africa\u2019s need for an instrument for\nfunctional cooperation which can harmonize development\nand cooperation between the States of this continent, the\nbreadbasket of the world.\nFor the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros,\ncooperation with the developing countries is an essential\nelement in such cooperative relations. My country is one of\nthose which are convinced that South-South cooperation can\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nbe an important factor in rebalancing world economic\nrelations.\nIn its continuous development efforts the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros is focusing on freeing and\nrestructuring development support institutions. In the spirit\nof this impetus towards socio-economic recovery, we have\nagreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank on a structural adjustment programme whose success\ndepends on the full and active support of the international\ncommunity.\nAs the century draws to a close, the world is\nexperiencing profound changes in the ideological, political,\neconomic, social, scientific and technical spheres. The\nproblems it is facing require consideration at the global level\nfrom now on. International solidarity compels us to act in\ngreater cooperation in managing world affairs.\nWe have the instrument for this: the United Nations.\nBut we are among those who believe that if it is to be more\neffective the Organization and its specialized agencies must\nbe transformed to adapt to the tremendous democratic\ndynamism of the new international system. In order to give\nthe United Nations the political power for real decision-\nmaking, the Security Council must genuinely represent the\nworld as it is today.\n"

        "file_text": "Permit me, first of all, to\ncongratulate Ambassador Insanally on his unanimous\nelection as President of the United Nations General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. I am confident that,\nunder his dynamic and wise leadership, coupled with the\nsupport of that able and consummate diplomat, His\nExcellency Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations, the deliberations of this Assembly will\nproduce constructive and fruitful results in meeting some of\nthe major challenges our world is facing at this time and in\nlaying a sound foundation for international relations in the\nforeseeable future.\nOur appreciation is also extended to His Excellency\nStoyan Ganev, the President of the General Assembly at its\nforty-seventh session, for his successful conduct of that\nsession of the Assembly.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to welcome\nthe new Member States that have joined us. I expect that\ntheir participation at this session will contribute significantly\nto international peace and cooperation.\nThe world has witnessed phenomenal changes within\nthe last two or three years. With the collapse of Soviet\ncommunism, many new independent States have emerged,\nand several countries whose citizens lived unwillingly behind\nthe Iron Curtain for almost half a century have rejoined the\nfree world. The bipolar world has disappeared and the cold\nwar has practically ended. These great changes provide an\nopportunity for us to reduce international tensions, to attain\ntrue parity among nations, to put an end to wasteful\ninvestments in destructive and devastating armaments and to\nfree up our resources for more productive use by all our\ncitizens.\nOn the other hand, however, we also see that these\nchanges in the world have created substantial uncertainties\nand in many instances have given rise to extremely tragic\nregional, local, ethnic and religious conflicts which, unless\naddressed by the international community, will endanger\nworld peace. These conflicts, combined with the continuing\nproblems of poverty, the widening gap between the rich and\nthe poor, and the scourge of drug use and drug trafficking\ncould offset the advantages we all hope to gain from the\nrecent changes. Do we have the vision, the creativity and\nthe resolve to ensure that the world takes positive advantage\nof the new realities for the benefit of all countries and\npeoples? Or will we continue to be myopic, dogmatically\nblind and self-centred, and risk losing this great opportunity?\nThe Afghan people have a special stake in the choice\nwe collectively make. We wish to ensure that our choice is\nthe right one and that all countries, including Afghanistan,\nshare fully in the benefits that should flow from the new\nrealities. Our special stake is based on our belief that the\nchanges that have taken place in the world are partly the\nresult of the enormous sacrifices made by our nation during\nthe 14 years of struggle against Soviet occupation and\ncommunist rule.\nIn this context, I would like to say a few words about\nsome of the issues confronting the world community today,\nissues which we must address in this Assembly. I will then\ndiscuss the situation in Afghanistan and state what our\nexpectations are of the United Nations and the world\ncommunity.\nOne of the issues confronting us is that of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The country\u2019s situation is indeed tragic, and\nwill be a test case to determine whether we in the\ninternational community have the sense of justice and can\nmuster the resolve to end this tragedy successfully and\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 21\njustly. The continuing occupation of Bosnian Muslim\nterritories by the Serbs, backed by the armed might of\nSerbia, the intransigence of the Serbians vis-\u00e0-vis the\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the untold atrocities\ncommitted against the innocent Bosnian Muslim population\nis not only an affront to this Organization but also an insult\nto humanity. The delegation of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan believes that aggression must not be rewarded\nand that any territorial gains that were made as a result of\nforce should and must be rectified. A definitive time limit\nshould be set by which the Serbs should agree to the terms\nof the London Conference and withdraw from the seized\nterritories. Otherwise, the current arms embargo against\nBosnia should be lifted and other urgent and effective\nmeasures, including the use of force, should be considered\nby the United Nations and the international community to\nensure that the Bosnian tragedy is ended and the Serbian\naggression repulsed.\nThe Palestinian people have suffered long. The Islamic\nState of Afghanistan would like to see peace finally achieved\nfor these people in a way that meets their national objectives\nand satisfies their right to self-determination. We believe\nthat the declaration of principles on Palestinian self-rule\nsigned in Washington on 13 September 1993 will serve as\nthe basis for a long-term solution to the Palestine problem\nand ensure peace and stability only if it is followed by\nearnest negotiations that lead first, to the withdrawal of\nIsraeli forces from the occupied territories; secondly, to the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State that\nincludes the Holy City of Jerusalem, one of the three most\nsacred cities of the Islamic world; thirdly, to the return of\nthe Palestinian refugees; and fourthly, to a resolution of the\nproblem of Israeli settlements in a manner acceptable to the\nnew Palestinian State.\nKashmir is another tragic issue that requires urgent\nattention. This issue has not only caused substantial\nsuffering to the people of Kashmir, but has become the\nsource of friction between two important neighbouring States\nin South Asia and has prevented the full realization of the\neconomic and trade potentials that exist within and outside\nthe region. The Islamic State of Afghanistan therefore urges\nthe resolution of this issue by these two States through\nnegotiations under United Nations auspices or under any\nother arrangements that may be acceptable to both sides,\ntaking into account the wishes and aspirations of the people\nof Kashmir.\nIn the case of Somalia, the Islamic State of Afghanistan\nis distressed by the chaos which has resulted from increasing\ncivil upheaval. We support the peace-keeping efforts of the\nUnited Nations and hope that international participation can\nensure a safe end to the turmoil in Somalia and the\nestablishment of a viable government to protect the interests\nand rights of the Somali people. We believe all peaceful\navenues that might help in solving this problem should be\nexplored.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan supports every\nequitable international effort to prevent the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons. However, given that most of the tragedies\naround the world are caused by the massive increase in the\navailability of conventional weapons, my delegation would\nwelcome and support a resolution to control the production\nand sale of such weapons. Such a resolution should also\nprovide for effective arms collection programmes in\ncountries which are saturated with weapons that are causing\ninternal and regional instability.\nNow I would like to focus the attention of the\nAssembly on my own country, Afghanistan. As all of you\nknow, Afghanistan has suffered enormously within the past\n15 years. I do not wish to go into the details of the\ndestruction that has taken place, but I would like to highlight\na few points very briefly.\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has\naptly summarized the tragedy of Afghanistan:\n\\\"Few countries in history have suffered to the\nextent Afghanistan has over the past fourteen years.\nAside from the physical destruction, which was often\nnothing short of cataclysmic, the results of the war\ninclude well over a million people killed, over 2 million\ndisabled, nearly 6 million refugees in neighbouring\ncountries, and 2 million internally displaced persons.\\\"\nAlmost the entire transportation, communication, and\npower infrastructure in Afghanistan has been either wiped\nout or severely damaged. The agricultural system is in total\ndisarray, with the irrigation system destroyed, much\nlivestock killed and the agricultural credit and extension\nservices totally defunct. The placement of millions of mines\nthroughout the country makes it impossible to revive the\nagricultural sector. Forests are denuded and the environment\nspoiled. Attempts to provide health care, medicine,\nimmunization and so on are stymied by the destruction of so\nmany hospitals and clinics. Mental health problems resulting\nfrom many years of war and bombings have no relief. In\naddition, thousands upon thousands of amputees require\nartificial limbs. Thousands of schools have been destroyed\nand many of our teachers and professors have been killed or\nexiled. Indeed, illiteracy has overtaken almost our entire\npopulation. A whole generation of Afghans has no\nexperience of normal life or of education in any form.\n22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe other two urgent problems we have are both linked\nto the lack of jobs and of economic alternatives within\nAfghanistan: the problem of large numbers of weapons in\nprivate hands and the problem of illicit drugs. I shall return\nto both of these matters a little later.\nLet me describe the plight of one individual, Abdul\nRahim. This man escaped to Pakistan from the war in\nAfghanistan nine years ago. He was newly married, with\none baby, and during his years in Pakistan he had two more\nchildren. Two of his brothers were killed in battle, and the\nthird died of disease that went untreated because of poor\nmedical facilities. He is responsible for two of his widowed\nsisters-in-law and their five children. Thus, as he returns to\nhis village in Afghanistan he is the head of a family of\ntwelve. He finds that his parents, who had refused to leave,\nare no longer there. It will be some time before he learns of\ntheir fate. His home is reduced to a pile of rubble, as,\nobviously, are those of his neighbours. The shops of the\nvillage are gone. The once-paved road that came almost to\nthe village is an unrecognizable path of dust and rocks.\nThere is no water and no electricity. Worse, there are no\ntrees or source of wood, and winter\u2019s shadow grows longer\nwith each cold night. In his once productive fields lie\nburned tanks and odd pieces of metallic rubble. His cousins\nnervously talk of land mines, one of which killed an old\nneighbour the day before his return. His family is concerned\nabout lack of flour, tea and sugar. This person is just an\nexample; there are millions of people like him in\nAfghanistan.\nOne of the most damaging legacies that Afghanistan\nhas inherited from Soviet occupation, Communist rule and\nthe long, drawn-out war is a substantial break-up of our civil\nand military administration and the virtual collapse of our\neconomic and financial institutions. In the past year the\nGovernment has taken substantial steps to correct the\nsituation. Indeed, progress has been made in re-establishing\ncentral authority and in reviving public and private economic\nand financial institutions. None the less, considerable work\nand much assistance will be required before we begin to\novercome those shortcomings.\nIn addition, given the destruction that has taken place,\nwe are in need of a massive reconstruction programme\nwhich we are unable to undertake unless we are assisted by\nthe international community. Last year the General\nAssembly adopted a resolution calling for reconstruction\nassistance to Afghanistan. Not much has happened since\nthen. A similar draft resolution will be presented to the\nAssembly this year, and we hope that it will be supported\nand that many can take part in putting it into effect.\nWhen we raise the question of assistance for\nreconstruction and revitalization of the economy, our request\nis gently dismissed with the reply that once security is\nestablished, Afghanistan will be helped. While granting that\nsecurity is important for a full-fledged reconstruction\nprogramme, I would suggest that a reasonable degree of\npeace and security does exist in large parts of Afghanistan.\nIn these areas reconstruction is possible and, if started, could\nserve as a catalyst in revitalizing the entire Afghan economy.\nThere are only a few areas where tensions exist and where\nthere may be intermittent fighting. We should also bear in\nmind that it may not be possible to have full peace and\nsecurity in the country unless we are able to start the process\nof reconstruction and provide people with productive\neconomic opportunities to make it attractive, and indeed\npossible, for them to give up their arms. The vicious circle\nof security first and then reconstruction or economic revival\nfirst and then security must be broken if we are to make any\nprogress.\nAnother dimension of security is obviously political.\nTo ensure that the entire Afghan nation participates in\ndetermining the country\u2019s future political structure, we plan\nto hold elections in the course of the coming year. We have\ntherefore requested the United Nations to help organize and\nsupervise the election process.\nNow I should like to come back to the two or three\npoints which I mentioned earlier.\nOne issue worth mentioning here and which has had\nboth regional and international implications is that of\nnarcotic drugs. At the present time the illicit cultivation,\nproduction, stocking, smuggling of and trafficking in narcotic\ndrugs are without a doubt critical problems that face\nhumanity. Regrettably, one of the legacies of the long war\nis the transformation of some parts of our country into\nstaging areas for illicit drug activity. This phenomenon,\nwhich is the result of the unavailability of economic\nalternatives, is a source of great pain to us. The Islamic\nState of Afghanistan, despite its scarce resources, has\nundertaken serious measures in the struggle against illicit\ndrugs. We shall spare no efforts in combating these illegal\nactivities. However, we must not overlook the reality that\nAfghanistan, with its extremely limited means and massive\neconomic and financial needs, is not in a position to\naccomplish effectively this task on its own. Afghanistan\nneeds urgent support from the international community to\nintensify the struggle against cultivation and of trafficking in\ndrugs.\nAnother area where we require cooperation is that of\nland mines. Last year the Secretary-General\u2019s report brought\nForty-eighth session - 11 October l993 23\nto the attention of the world the fact that there are more than\n10 million land mines in Afghanistan. It should also be\nmentioned that, on average, about 300 people fall victim to\nland mines each month. The agricultural sector, the\ntraditional base of the Afghan economy, will never be\nrevived until these mines are cleared. We of course express\nour gratitude for the past and ongoing mine-clearing\nprogrammes of the United Nations and experts from other\ncountries. However, there is an urgent need for greater\nassistance by interested countries both in actual\nmine-clearing operations and in training Afghan citizens so\nas to enable us to complete this task in as short a time as\npossible. In this connection, the delegation of the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan wholeheartedly supports the new item,\nintroduced by the European Community, on the current\nagenda of the General Assembly concerning mine-clearing\nprogrammes for war-stricken countries.\nWe Afghans want to reconstruct our country and to\nheal the wounds of the war that was imposed upon us. We\nlook forward to a normal life in which all our citizens\nparticipate fully in the political, economic, and social life of\nthe country, without any prejudice and without\ndiscrimination based on ethnicity, religious sect, language or\ngender. Here we consider it particularly important that\nAfghan women play an effective and positive role in the\nprocess of rebuilding Afghanistan. We want to raise the\nstandard of living of our people. We want to live in peace\nwith all our neighbours and to cooperate fully with them so\nthat we can use the vast resources of our region to the\nmaximum advantage of all our peoples. Indeed, we want to\nserve as a transit and trade route in our region. To this end,\nthe Islamic State of Afghanistan intends to devise a\nreconstruction and development strategy that takes into\naccount not only Afghanistan\u2019s own requirements, but also\nthe requirements of the region.\nWe are of course distressed by the recent upheavals in\nTajikistan. We have made every effort to ensure that\ntensions along the Tajik-Afghan border are reduced. For this\npurpose, official visits at the highest levels have been\nexchanged between the two countries. These visits have\nresulted in mutual understanding on important issues.\nAppropriate communiqu\u00e9s to this effect have been issued in\nKabul and Dushanbe. We welcome the decision of the Tajik\nauthorities to solve their internal political problems through\nnegotiations so that the Tajik refugees now in Afghanistan\ncan return to Tajikistan voluntarily with confidence, in\nsecurity and with honour, in accordance with international\nnorms. To this end we are planning to reach a trilateral\nagreement between Afghanistan, Tajikistan and the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan stands firm in support\nof human rights. This we consider not only an international\ncommitment, but also a religious conviction. The fact that\nafter the collapse of the communist regime in Afghanistan\nand the takeover by the Mujahideen, no policy of revenge\nagainst the former regime members was pursued is a good\nindication of this commitment. It is true, however, that due\nto the massive number of weapons now in private hands in\nour country some individual incidents of human rights\nviolations have taken place, and skirmishes between different\narmed groups have regrettably led to the loss of innocent\nlives. Therefore, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is taking\nmeasures to collect heavy arms from various armed groups.\nWe seriously hope that these efforts will bear fruit in the not\ntoo distant future.\nI also want to make it clear that, having been the\nvictims of terrorism ourselves, the Afghan nation opposes\nterrorism in any form or shape. We will never tolerate\nterrorism or allow Afghan territory to be used for such acts.\nTerrorism and the killing of innocent people is abhorrent to\nour religious beliefs and to our traditions. God Almighty\ncondemns the killing of innocent people and says that when\nanyone kills an innocent person, it will\n\\\"be as if He slew the whole people\\\". (The Holy Koran,\nV:35).\n24 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nThe world is also witness to the fact that throughout the\nunequal war against the former Soviet Union the Afghans at\nno point carried out any acts of terrorism against Soviet\ncitizens or Soviet property.\nI would like to conclude by stating that the international\ncommunity will draw maximum advantage from the changes\nthat have taken place in the world if we assume\nresponsibility for, and become committed to, working\ncollectively towards improving the lives of all peoples, while\neach country maintains its full independence and enjoys\nequal rights and privileges as a separate nation. All\ncountries represented in this body should be thinking not\nonly of the prevention of conflicts, but also of engaging our\nenergies to uplift the economic, social, and political lives of\nevery nation and citizen so that all are safe, secure and free.\nIt is with such vision, such commitment, such sense of\nsharing, that we will be able to realize the objectives for\nwhich this Organization was founded. For the attainment of\nthese goals, we must ensure that new opportunities in the\nworld are not wasted and that the sacrifices of millions of\npeople who gave their lives for freedom and dignity, as well\nas the silent suffering of those who despaired under years of\npoverty and oppression, were not in vain.\nFor our part, I would like to assure the Organization\nand the international community that Afghanistan will be a\nfull and cooperative partner in all constructive collective\nefforts aimed at ensuring international peace, stability,\nprogress, freedom and justice.\nMay God bless everyone present and help us all in our\nefforts.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I join\nprevious speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Samuel\nInsanally on his election as President of the forty-eighth\nsession of the General Assembly, and wish him success in\nperforming this highly responsible function. At the same\ntime, I address sincere thanks to Mr. Stoyan Ganev for the\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ncompetent manner in which he led this great forum during\nhis presidency.\nI also take great pleasure in expressing my gratitude to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his\ntireless efforts aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the\nUnited Nations.\nI take this opportunity to convey cordial congratulations\nto the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Eritrea, Andorra and\nMonaco on their admission to the United Nations.\nRecent political developments in a number of States\nand at the international level brought about the end of the\ncold war, the abatement of the danger of a nuclear\ncatastrophe and some other positive changes. Unfortunately,\nwe are compelled to note at the same time the emergence of\nsome negative phenomena, such as disastrous regional and\ninter-ethnic conflicts. The end of this century presents a\nterrible picture: countries and people torn apart by fierce\nfratricidal wars, towns and villages set on fire, thousands of\ndisplaced people and refugees, innocent victims, tearful\nwomen and children.\nThe serious and complicated problems of our times -\nfor example, those rooted in history or border disputes, and\nthose with ethnic and religious, political and economic,\nsocial and spiritual origins, have generated various conflicts\nwith grave consequences. These problems may lead to the\noutbreak of new violent confrontations in Europe that could\nendanger international peace and security. Under these\ncircumstances, which are indisputable, the United Nations\nand other international organizations, such as the Conference\non Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Western European\nUnion (WEU) and the European Economic Community\n(EEC) have a crucial role in stopping these unfavourable\ndevelopments by the peaceful settlement of conflicts, thus\nleading to the strengthening of peace, international stability\nand security.\nWhile appreciating the European efforts to find an\nadequate response to new challenges to security and stability,\nboth at the global and regional levels, we consider that the\nrole of the United Nations in this respect remains decisive.\nIn order to meet the new imperatives, the United Nations\nought to undergo a profound reorganization and a careful\nreassessment of its means. The report of the\nSecretary-General, \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", represents a\nreference point in the modern history of the United Nations\nand the starting-point of these necessary changes. We\nwelcome the continuation and broadening of the debates on\nthis matter.\nThe recent outbreak of regional conflicts - the Yugoslav\ncrisis in particular - reveals certain deficiencies in the\ninternational machinery dealing with peace and security\nissues, and indicates an urgent need for improvement.\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the reforms initiated\nwithin the framework of the Organization and is confident\nof its ability to adapt itself to the new political climate.\nThe appointment of an Under-Secretary-General for\nHumanitarian Affairs strengthens this confidence. In our\nopinion, the programme of reforms should include the\nfollowing three priorities: restructuring the Secretariat,\nrationalizing the work of the Main Committees and their\nworking mechanisms, and reinforcing the role of the\nSecretary-General in his relations with the subsidiary bodies\nand specialized agencies.\nI should like to point out that our delegation has been\npursuing with great interest the debates on the agenda item\nentitled \\\"Question of equitable representation on and increase\nin the membership of the Security Council\\\". We consider\nthat an increase in the membership of the Council aimed at\nensuring wider representation would be in full consonance\nwith the major changes that have occurred lately in the\ninternational arena and would reflect to a much greater\nextent the present level of democratization in international\nrelations. At the same time, we share the opinion that any\nchanges should maintain and increase the efficiency of this\nvital organ of the United Nations, taking into account a\nfurther possible recourse to the remarkable contributions by\nmajor Powers.\nOver two years have passed since the Republic of\nMoldova proclaimed its independence. Our aspiration to\nbecome a democratic State with a market economy is\nabsolute, notwithstanding the difficulties of transition. Our\ncountry has taken the first steps in this direction, irreversibly\nengaging itself on the path towards democracy. This\nresolute choice is reflected in our endeavours to join in\ninternational cooperation, an integral part of which is respect\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nThe Republic of Moldova has ratified the international\nconventions on human rights. The Government has\nconsistently come out in favour of assuming new\ncommitments to adapt the Republic\u2019s internal legal\nframework to international standards.\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 15\nThis position of principle on human rights on the part\nof the Republic of Moldova was reiterated at the World\nConference on Human Rights. Unfortunately, this\nconstructive approach has been vehemently challenged by\nthe separatist forces in Transdniestra, which are being\ninspired and supported from abroad. Shortly after the\nproclamation of independence, the pro-imperial forces started\nhostilities that resulted in great losses of innocent lives and\nflagrant violations of the basic rights of the native\npopulation, who were born and bred in areas controlled by\nseparatists.\nThe allegations by certain political forces and mass\nmedia in the Russian Federation that the conflict is an inter-\nethnic one are simply not true. In fact, it is a political\nconflict aimed at rebuilding the imperial structure. These\naccusations by the pro-imperial forces are meant to lead\npeople to the conclusion that human rights are being violated\nin the Republic of Moldova and that ethnic groups had been\nsubject to discrimination. In this respect, I should point out\nthat these accusations were not confirmed by the United\nNations and Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE) missions that visited my country on several\noccasions.\nThose same accusations were the pretext for the\nRussian Federation\u2019s decision to keep up a presence by its\narmed forces on my country\u2019s territory. The conditions\nimposed for the withdrawal of the Russian Fourteenth Army,\nnamely that special legal status must be granted to the\neastern districts of Moldova, is an attempt to keep that\ngeographical area - including the Republic of Moldova - in\nRussia\u2019s sphere of influence.\nThe presence of foreign military forces on the territory\nof the Republic of Moldova is the principal source of\ninsecurity and instability for my country. As was so rightly\npointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on the\nwork of the Organization, the question of the withdrawal of\nthe Fourteenth Russian Army is a major stumbling-block\nalong the way to a settlement of the conflict.\nIn this context, I should like to thank the European\nCommunity which, in their memorandum to the General\nAssembly, called for an early withdrawal of foreign troops\nfrom Moldova. In fact, the Fourteenth Army has huge\namounts of military hardware and enormous weapons\nstockpiles in Transdniestra that could easily be taken over by\nseparatist forces: this is what happened during the escalation\nof hostilities in 1992.\nMoreover, many residents of the eastern districts\ncontinue to be illegally drafted into the Fourteenth Army.\nThis is another example of crude interference in the internal\naffairs of the Republic of Moldova, and is a serious violation\nof international law.\nThus, with the political, logistic and moral support of\nthe Fourteenth Army, the separatist leaders are still doing\neverything they can to impede the talks on a political\nsettlement of the conflict. This has prevented the\nimplementation of the Moldovan-Russian agreement of\n21 July 1992 on the principles for a peaceful settlement of\nthe military conflict in the eastern districts of the Republic\nof Moldova.\nThe high degree of politicization of the foreign military\nforces stationed on my country\u2019s territory and their support\nfor the anticonstitutional regime in Transdniestra are the\nmain threats to the independence, integrity and security of\nthe Republic of Moldova. At the same time, the presence of\na foreign army in Moldova is the major obstacle to a\npeaceful settlement of the conflict in the eastern districts.\nWe therefore consider unacceptable the Russian Federation\u2019s\ninsistent proposals for it to be entrusted with a United\nNations mandate for peace-keeping operations in conflict\nzones throughout the former Soviet Union.\nFirst, we are convinced that neither the CSCE nor the\nUnited Nations have exhausted possibilities for solving these\nregional conflicts.\nSecondly, one of the basic criteria for participation in\npeace-keeping operations is impartiality. In view of Russia\u2019s\nobvious interest in these zones and its insistence on\nassuming the role of peace-keeper, it is clear that these\nefforts are aimed at continuing and justifying its military\npresence on the territories of independent and sovereign\nStates Members of the United Nations. Russia\u2019s final goal\nis obviously the revival of the old imperial structures with\nthe blessing of the international community.\nThe acceptance of the 14th Army\u2019s presence on the\nterritory of the Republic of Moldova as a precedent will\ncertainly be very dangerous, not only for the territories of\nthe newly independent States but also for all the adjacent\nareas.\nThe negotiations between the Governments of the\nRepublic of Moldova and the Russian Federation - which\nbegan last year - on settling the terms for the withdrawal of\nthe 14th Army have not attained any significant results. The\nRussian side obstructs the negotiations and displays no\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nwillingness to withdraw its military forces. In these\ncircumstances, the CSCE mission in the Republic of\nMoldova suggested that it participate in these negotiations.\nWhile the Moldovan party supported this initiative, the\nRussian party rejected it on every occasion. We note with\ndeep concern that the constructive attitude in favour of\ncompromise taken by the leadership of the Republic of\nMoldova is being repaid with a policy of fait accompli\nmeant to separate the Transdniester area from Moldova and\nplace a \\\"Trojan horse\\\" in my country.\nThe recent developments are relevant in this sense and\ndeepen this concern. General Alexandr Lebed, the\ncommander of the 14th Army was recently elected, with the\ntacit consent of Moscow authorities, a deputy to the\nso-called Supreme Soviet in the \\\"partial elections\\\" that took\nplace in the self-proclaimed \\\"Dniester Republic\\\". In this\nway General Lebed has proved once again his lack of good\nfaith and his total disregard for the provisions of the\nagreements signed by Presidents Mircea Snegur and Boris\nYeltsin.\nThe Government of the Republic of Moldova considers\nthat the defiant and cynical actions of General Lebed, who\nis a Russian citizen and the commander of a foreign army\ntemporarily stationed on the territory of my country,\nconstitute blatant interference in the internal affairs of a\nsovereign State. This action is a new attempt by certain\nconservative forces in Russia to recognize de facto the\nso-called Dniester Republic.\nIt would probably be enlightening to recall that the\nself-proclaimed authorities in Transdniestria applauded with\nenthusiasm the putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev in August\n1991. Moreover, during the recent events in Moscow, troops\nfrom Transdniestria were sent to the Russian capital to join\nthe Communist hardliners in their fight against President\nBoris Yeltsin. The active participation of Transdniestrian\nfighters in the Moscow rebellion was a logical consequence\nof the close ties between the Tiraspol leadership and the\nreactionary Russian parliament, which violated all\ninternational norms under the false slogan of \\\"defending the\nRussians\\\" by means of the so-called Dniester Republic and,\nin practice, created a bridgehead in Moldova for the\nrestoration of the Soviet empire.\nIn this context, I should like to inform the international\ncommunity that the situation in the area of conflict continues\nto be tense and is very likely to become unstable.\nWe have all accepted the general principle that a\nforeign army cannot be stationed on the territory of another\nState without the consent of the Government of the host\ncountry. I should also like to recall the appeals contained in\nthe documents of the CSCE and the North Atlantic\nCooperation Council, stating the need for complete,\nimmediate and unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Army.\nIn this spirit, we urge United Nations Member States to\nexamine, with understanding and good will, a possible\nrequest for the inclusion of an additional item on the agenda\nof the General Assembly, on the question of the complete\nwithdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of\nthe Republic of Moldova.\nIt is my belief that the same laudable solidarity\nexpressed by the international community with the Baltic\nStates is urgently needed by my country, which is prevented\nfrom achieving real independence and pursuing its firm\nchoice of democracy and freedom. We reiterate our support\nfor resolution 47/21, on the complete withdrawal of foreign\nmilitary forces from the territories of the Baltic States, and\nwe welcome with great satisfaction the encouraging\nachievement of the Lithuanian people, which has finally seen\nits territory free of foreign troops. We deem that only the\nconcerted action of international bodies, especially that of\nthe CSCE and the United Nations, can ensure peace and\nsecurity in our region and protect the territorial integrity and\nindependence of the Republic of Moldova.\nI wish to assure this body that my Government is fully\ncommitted to doing its utmost to protect the rights of\nForty-eighth session - 8 October l993 17\nminorities in the Republic of Moldova and is ready to\nreceive any international monitoring mission to ascertain the\nreal situation.\nI cherish the hope that the fresh spirit emerging at the\nUnited Nations will help us to identify, by consensus, the\nnecessary solutions for various problems the international\ncommunity is facing now. My delegation is ready to make\nits contribution to the carrying out of efficient cooperation\nwith other Member States in order to achieve the lofty goals\nof the United Nations that we are all striving for.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname, I take\ngreat pleasure in welcoming you, Sir, to the presidency of\nthe forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. You bring\nto your high office great experience as a skilled diplomat,\nexperience which will be useful in this epoch-making period\nfor the Organization. Indeed, your election is a fitting\ntribute to you personally and an honour to your country. We\nare therefore most gratified to see a skilled and a\ndistinguished son of our good neighbour, Guyana, presiding\nover our deliberations.\nWe thank your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev of\nBulgaria, for the excellent manner in which he conducted the\naffairs of the last session of the General Assembly.\nWe also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, for his tireless efforts in consolidating\ninternational peace and security.\nBefore proceeding, I should like to express the feelings\nof sincere sympathy of the Government and people of the\nRepublic of Suriname to the Government and people of the\nRepublic of India on the sad occasion of the tragic\nearthquake disaster in which so many lives were lost. I\nappeal to the international community to render the\nnecessary effective support to India to alleviate the sorrow\nand suffering of the people involved.\nI should like to take this opportunity to add to what\nnumerous previous speakers have already said on behalf of\nthe many people living in areas whose development\ndifficulties, and their consequences, do not receive enough\nattention, because of the high priority given to issues of\ninternational peace and security. I am referring to\ndeveloping areas that risk being forgotten, though they are\ninhabited by people who truly pursue welfare, well-being\nand prosperity, and seek true participation in the world\ncommunity, where the principle of power will ultimately\nmake way for the principle of interdependence within the\ninternational system.\nCountries in the developed North usually succeed in\nstrengthening their mutual relations in political and economic\nareas, and they are becoming increasingly interdependent.\nThanks to a greater environmental awareness, we are\nbecoming increasingly conscious that North and South\ndepend strongly on one another. This interdependence,\nunfortunately, has not yet evolved sufficiently with regard to\npolitical and economic questions, and the views held by the\nNorth and the South on many essential issues, such as the\nalleviation of poverty and economic development, are still\nstrongly divergent. Moreover, the interests of the North in\nmany ways still prevail over those of the South.\nIn particular, the financial and technological dependence\nof the South on the North causes serious divergences. The\ndiscriminatory regulations that make it difficult for the South\nto gain access to international markets and the ever-changing\nconditions that make the flow of funds to the South almost\nimpossible are, inter alia, factors that make the gap with the\nNorth almost unbridgeable.\nIn the past, agreements on multilateral and international\ncooperation, such as the International Development Strategy\nfor the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, the\nCartagena Commitment, Agenda 21 and the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,\nhave been approved by the international community. Those\ncommitments constitute a solid basis for strengthening global\npartnership for development. However, various programmes\ncould not be implemented, and much still remains to be done\nto enhance multilateral cooperation.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 19\nLike many developing countries, Suriname has a serious\nshortage of external funds for its development process,\ndespite its relative wealth of mineralogical and biological\nresources.\nCertainly, we have succeeded, through maximum\nmobilization of our national forces, in coping with the\npolitical crisis that dominated the country in the 1980s, and\nSuriname has been able to join the countries of Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean that have managed to give\nmeaning to the process of democratization. It is our joint\nresponsibility to see that this momentum is preserved and\nthat the euphoria of the victory of democracy over\ndictatorship, particularly in our region, does not have adverse\neffects.\nWithout broad-based development in our countries we\nshall not be able to provide democracy with a sound basis.\nFor the democratic ideal is not an isolated political\nphenomenon, but one that is closely interwoven with the\nwhole of the social and economic reality in our part of the\nworld.\nWithout alleviation of the pressing debt burden, without\nan appropriate recompense for our most important export\nproducts, without credit facilities for the necessary\nproduction inputs, without an expansion of export\npossibilities and without the financial support of the richer\ncountries, endeavours to realize a stable democratic\nconstitutional State will prove to be in vain. We have\nnoticed - not without concern - that in their attitudes towards\ndeveloping countries some developed countries ignore the\nspecific circumstances of those countries, which have fallen\nseriously behind in their development.\nThe political crisis which Suriname went through in the\n1980s, and Suriname\u2019s related isolation from the important\ndonors, caused a serious decline in the economic\ndevelopment of the country, which was further aggravated\nby the drastic reduction of the country\u2019s income from its\nmain export products - more specifically, alumina and\naluminium.\nIn order to meet the resulting financial, economic and\nmonetary crisis, we drafted a structural adjustment\nprogramme, which is now being implemented. We are\naware that, despite the many theories and analyses in this\nfield, there exists no blueprint for the resolution of economic\ncrises that can be applied smoothly inasmuch as the object\nof adjustment is a very complex reality.\nMy Government is also aware that achieving economic\nrecovery and furthering development while at the same time\nsafeguarding political stability is no easy task and must be\napproached quite prudently. It is a process which will entail\nincreased poverty, and can lead to a serious disruption of\nsocial life in the short term. Unfortunately, the divergent\nviews held by Suriname\u2019s authorities and by the donors on\nthe proper way to implement the adjustment programme puts\ngreat pressure on the space necessary for a policy which\nfocuses primarily on the well-being of the nation as a whole.\nThe failure, in many countries, of stringent adjustment\nprogrammes undoubtedly relates to a perspective which fails\nto recognize sufficiently the reality of developing countries\nat the present time and ignores the real aspirations of\nhumankind. In such a state of affairs, dialogue between\nNorth and South is difficult and strained. The North itself\nhas succeeded in developing a number of mechanisms to\nsolve differences, in which the consistent application of the\nprinciples of equality and mutual respect commands our\nattention. Such consistent use of these principles could also,\nperhaps, open the way to fruitful dialogue with the South.\nIn 1992 Suriname and the Kingdom of the Netherlands\nsigned a Framework Treaty. This Treaty, together with the\n1975 Treaty, provides a basic framework for substantial\nsupport from the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the\ndevelopmental aspirations of the Republic of Suriname. It\nis with pleasure that we can announce here that, within the\nframework of these treaties, positive cooperation was\nrealized last year, which contributed substantially to the\nsuccesses in consolidating the restored democracy in\nSuriname, strengthening the constitutional State and\nprotecting human rights, as well as in establishing and\nmaintaining peace after the end of the armed struggle in the\ninterior of the country.\nHowever, some questions have been raised as to the\nmotives for this cooperation in the light of the recent attitude\nof the Treaty partner regarding support for the recovery of\nour country\u2019s economy.\nDespite many efforts on the part of the international\ncommunity, the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which could\nprovide the framework for a comprehensive and sound basis\nfor future trade relations, are still ongoing. The Government\nof Suriname looks forward to an early and balanced\nconclusion of the Uruguay Round with a view to promoting\nthe establishment of a just and equitable multilateral trading\nsystem.\n20 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nRecession in the world economy, stringent budgetary\npolicies in donor countries, trade problems and domestic\nfactors in a number of countries have dampened the hope in\nmany developing countries for a steady flow of development\naid. Concurrently, new claims on external financial\nresources are being made, so that allocations for future aid\ncan further cloud the outlook for multilateral aid. The\ngeneral trend at present is a marked increase in contributions\nto peace-keeping operations and a clear decline in funds for\noperational activities.\nThe annual peace-keeping budget has increased\nfivefold, and is expected to be $3,673,000,000 for 1993,\nwhile voluntary contributions to the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations Fund for\nPopulation Activities and the United Nations Children\u2019s\nFund have declined by about 10 per cent. In one of his\nreports, the Secretary-General noted that very serious\nproblems caused by civil unrest and other sources of strife\naffect an increasing number of people who are often among\nthe most vulnerable groups of the population, placing\nparticularly difficult demands on United Nations operational\nactivities.\nFailure to address issues such as the alleviation of\npoverty, underdevelopment, unemployment, illiteracy and the\nthreat to the environment because of a lack of financial\nresources can cause social tensions. This, in turn, can\ngenerate social disintegration and, eventually, the\ndestabilization of the political system. Hence, an agenda that\ntends to reflect mainly international peace and security\nproblems is not constructive. More and more it is\nrecognized that favourable economic and social conditions\ncan help strengthen peace and security. Therefore, we\nfavour a programme based on a combination of political,\neconomic and social factors together with global security.\nThe social crisis of the 1990s may be considered a\nresult of, inter alia, world-wide growing poverty, particularly\nin the developing countries, unemployment and social\nupheavals. It is therefore gratifying to note that preparations\nare being made for a World Summit for Social Development\nin 1995. It is our hope that the core issues of the Summit\ndirected towards the strengthening of the process of overall\nsocial development will be addressed during the preparatory\nprocess and that agreement can be reached, in a spirit of\nconsensus, on matters of such vital human importance.\nAgenda 21, adopted during the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development in Rio de\nJaneiro, and the subsequent establishment of the Commission\non Sustainable Development, are important guides for the\ninternational community in achieving sustainable\ndevelopment. UNCED also underscored the need to provide\ndeveloping countries with adequate resources and to\nacknowledge the urgency of making technology, especially\nenvironmentally sound technology, available to that end.\nHowever, the progress achieved to date in obtaining new and\nadditional financial resources is disappointing. Hence, we\nwelcome the Commission\u2019s decision to establish two\nworking groups to tackle the two issues.\nMy Government supports a timely and strict\nimplementation of the Agreement signed by President\nAristide and General Raoul Cedras, containing arrangements\nmade with a view to reaching a political solution to the\nHaitian crisis. The United Nations and the Organization of\nAmerican States are playing a major role in implementing\nthe Agreement reached at Governors Island in New York.\nWe are deeply distressed by the recent developments in\nHaiti, which could jeopardize the return of President\nAristide. We strongly appeal to the military leaders in Haiti\nto uphold their promises and to create the atmosphere of\ncalm required for the full application of the Agreement.\nMy delegation has always stated that the principles of\nthe United Nations Charter and the relevant United Nations\nresolutions, particularly those of the Security Council,\nprovide the best concrete basis for the achievement of a\ncomprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.\nWe are therefore moved that the State of Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have finally started\na negotiating process which could create the conditions for\npeace. The Agreement that was mutually recognized and\nsigned is a courageous step in that direction. We\ncongratulate both Israel and the PLO on this historic deed\nand we appeal to the international community to use this\nmomentum to bring peace and prosperity to the whole\nregion.\nMy delegation welcomes the progress made so far by\nthe multilateral party negotiating process to a negotiated\nsettlement and national elections in South Africa. A political\nsettlement will lead to the end of apartheid and establish a\nnew, united, non-racial and democratic South Africa. The\ndestructive character of apartheid has caused so much harm\nto the people that it is only fair that in this new era, every\neffort must be made to overcome social and economic\ndisparities so that peace and stability can be established. We\ntherefore expect the international community to fully and\ngenerously support the new South African Government with\nassistance for the reconstruction and development of the\nnation.\nForty-eighth session - 7 October l993 21\nLike many others in the world, my country is troubled\nby the continuing horrifying events taking place in Angola\nand in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We cannot let the suffering\nand degradation continue. The bloodshed, hatred and\nhostilities must end now, for the people concerned have the\nright to live in peace.\nWorld-wide drug abuse and trafficking remain a matter\nof deep concern, not only in our region but in the world as\na whole. Despite measures and strategies geared towards\nthe elimination of drugs, it is sad to note that drugs can be\nobtained for illicit purposes virtually everywhere in the\nworld. This is, indeed, an unfortunate development, since it\nwas expected that after the Global Programme of Action was\nadopted, together with the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary\nOutline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control, the\nsituation would improve substantially. We thus support the\nview that efforts against drug abuse and trafficking must\ncontinue in a balanced and concerted manner.\nThe end of the East-West confrontation has resulted in\na slowdown of the arms race and reduced the threat of\narmed conflict. We regret to observe, however, that the\nspread of conventional arms continues to take on a\ndangerous magnitude, while at the same time armed\nconflicts are increasing, causing the tragic loss of numerous\ninnocent human lives. Ongoing conflicts have already\nresulted in more than 100 million refugees world wide, 30\nmillion displaced persons and hundreds of millions of\nunexploded mines. It is time to recognize that trade in\nconventional arms should be drastically curbed.\nIn the context of global security, the question of the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues\nto be an important one. My delegation is in favour of a\nuniversally applicable and internationally verifiable\ncomprehensive test-ban treaty. Such a treaty would\nstrengthen international security and would represent a\nfurther step towards nuclear disarmament.\nThe set of principles contained in the report of the\nSecretary-General \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\" provides a\ncomprehensive framework for the maintenance of interna-\ntional peace and security. My delegation follows with keen\ninterest the activities of the United Nations in the fields of\npreventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and post-conflict\npeace-building. We are aware that at present some 70 areas\nof conflict or potential conflict exist throughout the world.\nIn this respect, we welcome the involvement of regional\norganizations that can render valuable assistance in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, including\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes.\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations,\nMember States have entrusted to the Security Council the\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. The balance of political and economic\npower in today\u2019s world has drastically changed.\nConsequently, the premise that brought about the structure\nof the Security Council is no longer valid. The general\ndebate last year on the issue of equitable representation and\nan increase in membership of the Security Council, which\nled to the adoption of resolution 47/62, can, it is hoped,\ncontribute to a more equitable geographical representation\nin the Council and to enhancing the democratization process\nof the work of the Council by making its deliberations more\ntransparent.\nThe expectations in the developing world that the\npost-cold-war era would create new development\nperspectives have not yet materialized. However, the\nincreasing pauperization of large parts of the world demands\nthe taking of urgent and decisive action to offer those people\nprospects for change and improvement in their daily living\nconditions. To this end, our Organization will have to\nstrengthen its prominent role as a factor for development and\nwill have to make the appropriate mechanisms effectively\noperational.\nIt is important for all Member States to provide the\nUnited Nations with legitimate room for that purpose.\nSuriname will, to the extent possible, make its contribution.\n"

The technological\nrevolution and the spread of democracy are the two factors\nthat will empower humankind in its most genuine flowering.\nIn the political field, the new international order that we\nare seeing emerge is nourished by the fall of political and\nmilitary blocs, the collapse of ideological borders and a\ndeepening of disarmament. Cooperation is replacing\nconfrontation. The elements of power are being reallocated\nin the light of the new variables that offer a renewed\nchallenge to the multilateral organizations in the international\narena.\nIn the economic field, technological development has\nreplaced traditional comparative advantages with\ncompetitiveness and excellence. Quality is the basis for the\nproduction of goods and services. These trends, if stripped\nof their human element, would be little more than a\nmaterialistic expression lacking the necessary sense of\nsolidarity. A new order cannot be summed up simply as a\nreallocation of the outward expressions of power. The\nglobal nature and the interdependence that characterize\ninternational relations today find their ethical content and\nlegal expression in the continuing validity of the fundamental\nprinciples of international law.\nIn this context, we are facing today new horizons and\nbetter prospects for understanding between nations. In this\nrespect, we hail with particular satisfaction the peace reached\nin the Middle East between the State of Israel and the\nPalestine Liberation Organization, and we welcome it as an\nexample and symbol of the new era of cooperation which\nnations must carry forward on the threshold of the new\ncentury.\nAlso, within the Latin American region, Uruguay is\npleased to point to the consolidation of the peace processes\nin El Salvador and Guatemala. This has been achieved\nthrough the efforts made by their peoples and Governments,\nwith the constant support of the international community.\nThe practice of direct diplomacy, with mechanisms for\npolitical consultation and coordination, has been successful.\nIn this context, Uruguay wishes to stress the role played by\nthe Organization of American States in the grave crises\nsuffered by Peru, Guatemala and Haiti.\nWe can add little to a diagnosis on which we all agree.\nOur responsibility lies in our capacity to propose solutions,\nboth in our own domestic spheres and internationally; this is\na challenge that every generation faces, taking national\nfeelings as the basis for a leap forward towards prosperity\nand the expression of the international community as a basis\nfor the credibility that nurtures the hopes of the great\ndispossessed majorities.\nUruguay wishes here to emphasize three particularly\nimportant issues: the relationship between international\ntrade, development and political stability; the new\narticulation of the concept of collective security; and, lastly,\nthe problems of human rights and the environment as part of\nbroadening the concept of integral development.\nThe dissoluble interdependence between development\nand political stability is obvious. Freedom in its most\ncomplete expression admits of no ambiguous interpretation.\nAnd, just as human rights cannot be subject to the whims of\nGovernments, neither can free trade be limited by the\npressures of national or sectoral interests. Political freedom\nand free trade are two sides of the same coin.\nThe opening of markets between developed and\ndeveloping countries cannot therefore be seen as a zero-sum\nexercise; rather, it is an undertaking of benefit to all.\nGreater competitiveness powers the process that begins with\ngrowth, is strengthened by a better distribution of wealth and\nis consolidated by the credibility of democracy and its\ninstitutions. This shared responsibility makes no allowance\nfor double-talk from any side.\nIn our capacity as Chairman of the Negotiating\nCommittee of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the ministerial level, we\nwish to express our concern over the obstacles in the way of\n14 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nconcluding the Round. After seven long years of\nnegotiations, certain trends continue to obstruct the\nmultilateralization process. Bilateral negotiations are\ncurtailing opportunities for reaching a comprehensive,\nbalanced result that takes into account all the interests at\nstake, and particularly those of the developing countries, in\naccordance with GATT\u2019s own norms.\nFor several years now Uruguay has been working hard\nto make structural adjustments in its economy. Policies to\nmake trade more open, both domestically and internationally,\nhave been put in place with the aim of modernizing the\nindustrial sector, facilitating technological innovation and\nincreasing competitiveness so as to achieve, in the final\nanalysis, a more efficient integration into the world economy\nand world trade.\nDeregulation of production, reform and modernization\nof the public sector as well as strict fiscal adjustments aimed\nat balancing the use of the country\u2019s financial and monetary\nresources have supplemented external liberalization policies\nwhich have placed us among those who have reduced tariff\nand non-tariff barriers at the fastest rate.\nThis great effort of adjustment carried out by Uruguay\n- in a similar fashion to many other developing countries -\nhas been achieved not only in the framework of deep social,\neconomic and political difficulties, but has also been\nundertaken unilaterally without any compensation at all from\nits partners in the international system, especially the more\ndeveloped countries.\nThus Uruguay emphasizes once again its firmest\nrejection of all protectionist policies which continue to be\napplied by some highly industrialized countries. These are\nclearly incompatible with the rules of GATT and with the\nstatus quo commitments agreed at the beginning of the\nUruguay Round. At the same time, they are a disincentive\nfor the efforts made in the framework of democracy to\nstrengthen institutions and to have an appropriate social\ndialogue.\nIt is disquieting to witness the behaviour of many\ncountries which preach the virtues and benefits of the free\nmarket and economic liberalism but at the same time close\ntheir borders to trade from countries whose well-being\ndepends to a significant degree on access to such markets.\nTherefore, Uruguay calls once again and most\nemphatically on all nations, especially the major trading\npartners, to make possible a successful conclusion of the\nUruguay Round negotiations, in which comprehensiveness\nand balance are values to be preserved in a strengthened\nmultilateral framework.\nIn this context, Uruguay also believes that regional\nintegration is the best path towards international\nparticipation. Today nothing can be done individually.\nInterrelationships exist between large economic blocs; no\ncountry can escape that reality.\nThe creation of economic blocs must be interpreted as\na consequence of a process of integration and liberalization\nof world markets. Blocs are a tangible approximation, an\nintermediate step, to the goal of free trade, the ultimate goal\nof GATT. Furthermore, this is the thrust of Uruguay\u2019s\nresolute participation in the Southern Cone Common Market\n(MERCOSUR) and of the integration efforts of the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, the Group of Three, the\nAndean Pact and the bilateral agreements within the Latin\nAmerican Integration Association.\nUruguay recognizes that the new concept of\ninternational security includes institutional, legal and political\naspects. From an institutional standpoint, we must avoid\nextensive use of the powers of the Security Council based on\na sense of pragmatism that might undermine the criteria\ngoverning the delicate balance between the main organs of\nthe United Nations. The disappearance of bipolarity enables\na new political reality to pervade the Council\u2019s decisions. If,\non the one hand, the traditional situations caused by the cold\nwar have been unblocked, on the other hand, there must be\ncareful control of the trend towards possible excesses of\npower by those nations enjoying a privileged situation.\nUruguay shares the thoughts of the Secretary-General\nexpressed in paragraph 80 of his document \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\" (A/47/277):\n\\\"The powerful must resist the dual but opposite calls of\nunilateralism and isolationism if the United Nations is\nto succeed.\\\"\nThe General Assembly must reassert its authority on the\nbasis of the Articles of the Charter which define its functions\nand powers. In the area of peace and security, the General\nAssembly\u2019s constitutional limitations are set out in Articles\n12, 24 and 36 of the Charter. These we abide by.\nNevertheless, its primacy is clear in the economic and social\nareas.\nTo revitalize the General Assembly is to identify its\noriginal mandate, reaffirming its areas of authority and\ngiving this organ, in which we are all permanently\nrepresented, stronger involvement in the Organization\u2019s\nForty-eighth session - 4 October l993 15\nactivities. This is the way to contribute to equity and the\nbalance of power established by the Charter. We also\nbelieve in strengthening the International Court of Justice,\nboth in its administrative and consultative functions.\nWhat I have said does not weaken our support for\nadapting the Security Council to the new international reality\nby reforming its composition and working methods. This\nprocess must gain general consensus and respect the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States. Only in this\nway can we ensure greater representation, transparency and\nefficiency.\nWe also believe that all this energy for renewal must be\ninjected appropriately into the Organization\u2019s bureaucracy.\nThe United Nations is the sum of its organs, including its\nspecialized agencies. An improvement in efficiency must go\nhand in hand with possible global transformations. We must\nstrive to rationalize our operational systems in order to\nstreamline administrative procedures, which often amass\nthrough inertia hundreds of initiatives which wander\naimlessly, at great cost, through the machinery of an\ninsatiable bureaucracy.\nInternational security also finds its most genuine\nexpression in strict compliance with international law. In\nthis context, which is fraught with uncertainty and\nunpredictable events, the principles of self-determination,\nnon-intervention, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the\nobservance of good faith in the fulfilment of international\nobligations must be interpreted not as concepts that are\nvague or not properly drawn up by a naive legal system, but\nas the pillars of international relations.\nIt is also out of political realism and pragmatism that\nUruguay turns to the law as the main shield for its defence.\nOur former Ambassador to the United Nations,\nDr. Carlos Mar\u00eda Vel\u00e1zquez, has said that the small\ncountries\n\\\"need to know, for reasons of our true national interest,\nhow far we can go and - most important - where we\ncan be taken. Respect for the law and international\nbehaviour that follows legal rules are the only path\ntowards a consolidation of the values of culture,\nfreedom and dignity.\\\"\nUruguay, true to its tradition, continues to interpret\nArticle 51 of the Charter strictly and continues to claim the\ncompensation to which it is entitled under Article 50 as a\nconsequence of the losses caused by the Gulf War. It does\nso not only for material reasons, but because it believes that\ncollective security is based on the credibility of the rules that\nregulate it.\nJust as Uruguay is a jealous guardian of the principles\nof international law, it is genuinely open to all those\nundertakings which, in fulfilment of an international\nmandate, constitute an indispensable contribution to world\npeace and security. Thus, we believe that peace-keeping\noperations are an essential part of the multilateral policy of\nthe United Nations, without prejudice to the necessary efforts\nbeing made in the field of preventive diplomacy.\n\nUruguay has increased the number of armed forces\npersonnel placed at the disposal of the United Nations. The\nnumbers are highly significant in relation to the country\u2019s\npopulation and the size of its military. It has also expressed\nto the Secretary-General its readiness to host regional\ntraining centres for United Nations peace-keeping forces.\nOur armed forces adopt a professional approach to\npeace-keeping missions, in which they are representatives of\nthe international community. It gives them satisfaction to\nsee their efforts contributing to establishing peace between\nStates and to regional and national reconciliation, as in\nCambodia, where, at last, democratic values and respect for\nhuman rights prevail.\nWe are concerned, however, over the risk of these\noperations\u2019 being discontinued because of delays in the\npayment of countries\u2019 contributions. It would be contrary to\nthe principle of universality if, owing to these difficulties,\nonly countries with vast financial resources could participate\nin such operations.\nWe believe that this policy of collective security must\nbe supplemented by a policy of disarmament and a universal\nban on nuclear weapons. The signing of international\nnon-proliferation agreements and the adoption of the\nConvention banning chemical weapons, which was signed in\nParis last January, constitute progress in this field - progress\nthat we endorse. We are also pleased to highlight the\ncontribution of our neighbours Argentina, Brazil and the\nRepublic of Chile through their implementation of regional\nagreements aimed at ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear\nenergy and the non-proliferation of all types of weapons of\nmass destruction.\nStability and balance are threatened by poverty on a\nvast scale - widespread and critical poverty. Social\n16 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\ndevelopment implies giving priority to social expenditure,\nbut only where this is made possible by real growth,\nallowing for a reduction of the voluntary sector that is\ndeveloping in many of our societies. Collective security, as\nwell as ethics, must be taken into account in our approach to\nthis entire problem. Uruguay therefore attaches great\nimportance to Chile\u2019s welcome initiative in the convening of\nthe World Summit for Social Development, to be held in\n1995. This will provide a great opportunity for serious study\nof the scope of the concept of social development.\nThe ultimate beneficiaries of the integral development\nof the nations of the international community must be man\nand his environment. We therefore wish to highlight here\nthe importance of action on issues related to human rights\nand preservation of the environment.\nAt present, technology and international peace and\nsecurity are based on a narrow interpretation of the concept\nof human rights. Words and speeches are useless if, as\nPresident Clinton suggested, while we are gathered at this\nGeneral Assembly thousands of children in the world are\ndying of hunger. What of the essence of democracy can we\nrescue if, as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in many other\nplaces, we look on helplessly as people indulge in behaviour\nthat we thought had been eradicated for ever?\nThe concept of human rights - their intrinsic worth and\nnature - is not affected by political, religious, sectional or\neven State interests or considerations. The ethical heritage\nof contemporary international society cannot allow\nconcessions in the defence of these rights and principles.\nAny concession would affect the credibility of the\ninstitutions and values of freedom and human dignity as the\nbases of democracy.\nDuring the Vienna World Conference on Human\nRights, the States parties solemnly reaffirmed their\ncommitment to promoting respect for and protection of those\nrights. In this context, our country supports the\nestablishment of a high commissioner for human rights, in\nthe framework of the international system.\nMoreover, Uruguay repeats President Lacalle\u2019s\nstatement to the Secretary-General of our country\u2019s\nwillingness to help in the evacuation of children who are\ninnocent victims of hatred and intolerance. We hope that\ninertia will not prevail over political decisions or human\nsensitivity. Those who suffer and die in the midst of\ncollective insanity must not be held hostage to bureaucratic\nstructures. If this happens, the documents approved at the\nWorld Summit for Children in September 1990 will have\nbeen relegated to the rhetorical scrapheap of its meetings.\nIntegral development implies careful consideration of\nthe problems of the environment. The concept of sustainable\ndevelopment requires a link between environmental issues\nand economic and social issues. In this context, States must\nundertake bilateral and multilateral commitments, by means\nof conventions, going beyond mere statements. This is also\nan aspect of the North-South dialogue and of action to deal\nwith the conflicts of interests that it entails. Uruguay has\nincorporated in a cross-border agreement with Brazil the\nconcept of responsibility for environmental degradation. It\nwishes to reiterate the need to establish a legal system to\nresolve environmental disputes through codification of\ninternational environmental law, in the spirit of the\nresolution adopted at the Rio Summit in 1992.\nFinding a way to force States to accept responsibility\nfor non-compliance with the rules for protection of the\nenvironment continues to be the basis for a fair relationship\nbetween the industrialized countries and the developing\ncountries.\nSuch are the main issues of concern to Uruguay. In the\nframework of all the ambivalence, all the areas of light and\nshadow in the international arena, we are taking part in this\nsession of the General Assembly - as we have done since the\nfoundation of the United Nations - in the hope that deeds\nwill be shown to be more eloquent than words.\n"

        "file_text": "Please accept my warmest congratulations, Sir,\nupon your election to preside over the General Assembly at\nits forty-eighth session. I am certain that your election will\ncontribute to its success.\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place two\nyears before we are to celebrate the Organization\u2019s fiftieth\nanniversary. We long had to navigate through the stormy\nwaters of the cold war and ideological confrontation. It was\nnot an easy task. However, today\u2019s world is different from\nthat of the signatories of the United Nations Charter. East-\nWest d\u00e9tente has given us renewed hopes, though we have\nstill not won the war against poverty and social\nmarginalization. Our main goal should be to make those\nhopes a reality, if we wish to build a society where not only\na just peace but peaceful justice prevail.\nObviously, the reorganization of the Security Council\nis not an easy task, and it becomes even more difficult if we\ntake into account the fact that, since the very moment the\nSan Francisco Charter was signed, the Council has been\nmade up of permanent and non-permanent members, and that\nthe right of veto extended to the permanent members has\ngiven rise, among other things, to their being accused, with\nsome justification, of attacking the principle of the legal\nequality of States.\nThe Republic of Panama is of the opinion that if the\nSecurity Council is to be reorganized, the reorganization\nmust be carried out in such a way that the representation on\nthe Council of all United Nations Members is equitable.\nTherefore, any reorganization must promote fair participation\nfor the developing States, as the situations that used to be\ngiven as explanations for the way the Council was composed\nand for the right of veto have disappeared now that there is\nEast-West d\u00e9tente.\nDrug addiction has become the main scourge of\nhumanity. The Republic of Panama, like all States, therefore\nhas the duty to repress drug trafficking and the resulting\nmoney-laundering activities on its territory, and to help\nrepress these illegal activities in all States. Panama, aware\nof these responsibilities and of the fact that the effective\nrepression of drug-related crimes makes international\ncooperation necessary, on 11 April 1991 Panama and the\nUnited States of America signed a Treaty on Mutual\nAssistance in Criminal Affairs, which was ratified by the\nPanamanian Legislative Assembly on 11 July 1991. The\nTreaty is currently awaiting the consent of the United States\nSenate before the effects we expect from it can begin to be\nfelt.\nOn 1 March 1993, Panama and the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland signed the Agreement on\nMutual Legal Cooperation on Drug Trafficking, which must\nfirst be approved by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly\nbefore it too can be ratified. In addition, and at Panama\u2019s\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 5\nrequest, the Central American countries have agreed to sign\na similar treaty, which will be opened to accession by all the\nLatin American countries. Also, the Panamanian Executive\nBranch has submitted the United Nations Convention against\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\nto the Panamanian Legislative Assembly for its\nconsideration; we are convinced that, once it is ratified, we\nshall have at our disposal a valuable instrument in our\nstruggle against drug-related crime.\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms do not come\nas a generous concession from a State or its authorities.\nThey are inherent to the human person, regardless of\npolitical, social, racial, religious or any other factor. Those\nrights and freedoms are therefore inseparable, and must be\nrecognized and respected. The fact that those rights and\nfreedoms are inherent to the human person affords them a\nuniversality and indivisibility that must be strengthened.\nViolations of human rights and fundamental freedoms\ndo not only attack the person whose rights and fundamental\nfreedoms have been trampled on; they also attack\ninstitutional stability, the constitutional order and the rule of\nlaw. This is so because the person whose rights and\nfreedoms have been disregarded is inclined towards\ninsurrection or at least towards personal revenge, the private\nvengeance of the eye-for-an-eye principle.\nRespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, or\nviolations of them, must therefore be examined not only as\na problem that affects individual interests but rather in a\nmuch wider context, as a problem that affects society in\ngeneral. This is why most of the insurrections, rebellions\nand fratricidal conflicts have their origins in violations of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms to the detriment of\nlarge swathes of the population. Such violations often stem\nfrom a lack of democracy, from the absence of the rule of\nlaw, from extreme poverty and from social marginalization.\nWhile on the subject of lack of democracy, I wish to\nstate that, under the United Nations Charter, a purpose of\nthis Organization is\n\\\"To develop friendly relations among nations based\non respect for the principle of equal rights and\nself-determination of peoples ...\\\".\nIn conformity with the principle of self-determination, all\ncountries can adopt the form of government that best suits\nthem. However, by allowing dictatorial regimes to exist, the\ninternational community takes away all the principle\u2019s force.\nThe thing is that sovereignty - and the same can be said\nof self-determination - can be harmed otherwise than by the\nacts of outside States. They can also be violated by a\nState\u2019s own nationals, when they place themselves above the\npopular will, as has often occurred; dictatorships have\ndisregarded just this principle of self-determination and have\nso violated human rights. This is so because the only source\nof public power is the people.\nWhen a dictatorship disregards the principle of self-\ndetermination or the peoples\u2019 sovereignty - which occurs\nevery time a people is denied its inalienable right to adopt\nthe form of government that best suits its interests - it\nviolates sovereignty, and the principle of self-determination,\ninasmuch as the State\u2019s power to act does not have its\nsource in the people: it has its source in those who hold\npublic power with no more legitimacy - if it can be called\n\\\"legitimacy\\\" - than the force of arms. In addition, when a\ndictatorship disregards human rights, it deprives the\ninhabitants of the State, the people, from whom sovereignty\nand self-determination flow, of rights that every State must\naccord its citizens simply because they are human persons.\nI have allowed myself to briefly address the principle of\nself-determination because I am convinced that a clear\nunderstanding of this principle will contribute towards\nstrengthening its legal force, to the benefit of democracy and\nthe rule of law.\nThe situation Haiti is going through is worrying. The\nGovernors Island Agreement provides that, by the 30th of\nthis month, the constitutional President, Jean-Bertrand\nAristide, must once again occupy the presidential throne.\nHowever, the de facto Government would appear to be more\nintent on provoking violence than promoting the re-\nestablishment of the constitutional order. Since 3 July,\n11 people have been given their quietus, including the pro-\ndemocracy activist Antoine Izmeri, whose struggle merits\nrecognition throughout the Americas.\nThe Republic of Panama believes that the agreement\nbetween the constitutional Government and the chief of the\nHaitian Army must be fulfilled, and hopes that the\nOrganization, striving to live up to the principles that inspire\nit, will ensure that it is.\nRecognition of the State of Israel within secure and\nrecognized borders and the establishment of a Palestinian\nState are acts of justice restored which international peace\nand security make essential. Therefore, the Republic of\nPanama cannot be indifferent to the Declaration of Principles\nsigned by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization\n6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\n(PLO) on 13 September, or to the agreement on provisional\nautonomy for the Gaza Strip and Jericho.\nSince the formation of the State of Israel, Israelis and\nPalestinians have been victims of all the damage that\nincomprehension and intolerance can cause. The\nconfrontational relationship between these two peoples\nblinded by hatred is summarized in the 45 years of tears,\npain and death. However, the wars and exoduses of 1948,\n1956, 1967 and 1973, with their consequences of grief and\nsuffering, should now serve as evidence of the benefits of\npeace. Therefore, a peace agreement between Israelis and\nPalestinians should become a goal for the United Nations.\nThe atmosphere of d\u00e9tente to which I have already\nreferred should foster the universality of representation in\nthis multilateral Organization. Consequently I am gratified\nto see that many States that have never traditionally had an\nactive international life, such as Andorra, Liechtenstein,\nMonaco and San Marino - to mention only a few States\nenclaved in the European continent - have felt the need to\njoin and support us in the important tasks we are resolved to\naccomplish. It is in that spirit of universality that Panama\nhas supported and continues to support the initiative\ndesigned to study now and in the future, with innovative\nideas and goodwill, the situation of the largest human group\nthat has no voice in this body: the 21 million inhabitants of\nthe island of Taiwan.\nThe Central American countries are striving to build a\npeaceful, free, democratic and developing region. For that\nreason, the efforts to bolster peace that have been initiated\nrequire actions capable of solving our economic, social,\ncultural and humanitarian problems in order to strengthen\nour peoples\u2019 faith in democracy.\nThe endeavours to achieve democracy, national\nreconciliation and development in the region are obvious.\nBut in order to continue making these efforts we require the\ncooperation of all States that believe in democracy, justice\nand freedom. Therefore, associating myself with the\ninitiative presented by the Ibero-American Heads of State\nand Government in Salvador, Brazil, I call on States and\ninternational organizations to cooperate effectively with the\nCentral American Integration System (SICA) so that it can\npromote and strengthen sustained subregional cooperation\nand attain its fundamental goal.\nThe ability of we who inhabit the vast territories south\nof the Rio Bravo to communicate with each other and with\nSpain in the same language - a Nicaraguan poet once called\nthem the countries that love Christ and speak Spanish - has\ncreated an Ibero-American community which today, in\nmeetings of Heads of State and Government, and together\nwith Brazil and Portugal, is determined to focus its strength\non the future, guided by the desire to take full advantage of\nthe similarities which bring us together to consolidate\nopportunities for cooperation and solidarity.\nThis should be gratifying to the whole of the\nIbero-American community, since our faith in the future is\nbecoming increasingly obvious at each Summit. The first\nSummit, in Guadalajara, created the forum of Heads of State\nand Government; at the second and third Summits, in\nMadrid and Salvador, respectively, we saw the initial results\nof these commendable initiatives. It is also appropriate here\nto note that the Final Document of the third Summit states:\n\\\"Without prejudice to the spheres of competence of\nspecialized international forums, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly should focus its international\ndevelopment cooperation policy on securing greater\naccess for developing countries to world markets,\nadequate forms of finance and modern technology.\nThis will make it possible to overcome the obstacles to\ndevelopment and, while benefiting the developing\ncountries, will also open up economic opportunities for\nthe industrialized countries, thereby easing the\nmigratory pressures exerted on them by those\nlegitimately seeking ways to improve their standard of\nliving.\\\" (A/48/291, para. 14)\nI would feel most fortunate if the General Assembly\nwere to listen attentively to the demands of the\nIbero-American community, which feels that most of the\nproducts of its member States have been repeatedly denied\nincreased access to markets which have been traditionally\naccessible, as in the case of bananas in the European\nCommunity, as well as access to financing and modern\ntechnology. For our part, the Ibero-American States should\nbe resolved to put our financial situations in order and not\ndepend on the marketing of a few products, and we should\nimprove the quality of our educational systems, in order to\nattain greater economic stability. The Ibero-American\ncountries should also resolve to turn the cooperation and\nsolidarity mentioned in the Final Document into sincere and\nhonest cooperation and solidarity, and not mere rhetoric, as\nis so often the case. Only in that way will we be able to\nprofit to the full from the affinities that we share.\nPanama will be the host country of the Summit of the\nIbero-American Heads of State and Government in the year\n2000. This event will unquestionably have great significance\nfor my country. It will take place precisely at a time when\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 7\nthe Panamanian people have attained their most important\nlegal and political objective: recovering their rights over the\nPanama Canal and freeing their territory from the\njurisdictional limitations imposed by the ill-fated Hay-Bunau\nVarilla Treaty. That is so because the present Panama Canal\nTreaty will expire on 31 December 1999. Consequently, the\nRepublic of Panama will then manage, operate and maintain\nthe Panama Canal. All the real estate, fixture improvements\nand equipment that the United States of America will be\nusing until the end of the validity of the Treaty will revert\nto Panama. One of the Panamanian people\u2019s greatest wishes\nwill thus come true on 31 December 1999.\nHowever, as important as achieving this legal and\npolitical objective may be, it is the good or bad use we make\nof the Canal and the areas that revert to us that will mark\nour future in a positive or negative way. Thus, it is our duty\nas a nation to manage the Canal wisely and to use in the\nbest possible way the areas that revert to us.\nFor that reason Law No. 5 of 1993 created the\nAuthority of the Panamanian Interoceanic Region, with the\nobjective of improving the use of the assets that are\nreverting and will revert to Panama between now and the\nyear 2000. Similarly, on 6 September 1993 a draft bill for\nconstitutional reform was submitted to the Panamanian\nLegislative Assembly; it is designed to add a new article to\nPanama\u2019s political Constitution which will create the Panama\nCanal Authority, whose main function will be to manage and\noperate the Canal. That will ensure that the Authority will\nnot be affected by any political shifts. Thus, the Republic\nof Panama is preparing to manage, operate and maintain the\nPanama Canal from 31 December 1999. This task will be\nall the easier because the current Canal Administrator, and\n87.7 per cent of the Panama Canal Commission employees\nare Panamanians, not counting those with dual nationality.\nOn the basis of the Panama Canal Treaty, Panama and\nthe United States agreed in 1982 to create the Preparatory\nCommission to prepare the points of reference for the\nfeasibility studies of a sea-level canal in Panama and other\nalternatives to the Panama Canal. They also agreed to invite\nJapan to be a full member of this Commission, an invitation\nJapan accepted. These three States created the Commission\nfor the Study of Alternatives to the Panama Canal.\nOn 20 September last, this Commission presented its\nfinal report, a Joint Statement of Commission Members,\nwhich indicates that the \\\"current Panama Canal with the\nwidening of the Gaillard Cut seems to be able to meet the\nneeds of international maritime trade until the end of the\nsecond decade of the twenty-first century. However,\\\" the\nstatement continues, \\\"before the year 2000 measures should\nbe taken to prepare the canal for the time when the current\nPanama Canal will not be able to take care of the projected\ntraffic.\\\" Such measures include \\\"future studies to firmly\nestablish the dates when improvements will become\nnecessary in order to start planning the required\nenvironmental studies involved in the final engineering\ndesign and the initiation of the construction\\\".\nAccording to the aforementioned report, the results of\nthe study indicate that the alternative of high-level locks,\nwith one lane of maritime traffic at the Gaillard Cut,\noperating jointly with the current canal and capable of\nhandling ships of 200,000 dead-weight tonnage, is\nmarginally feasible.\nIn order to handle the projected traffic with the same\nefficiency during the twenty-first century as it has been\nhandled since the opening of the Canal on 15 August 1914,\nif not with even greater efficiency, the aforementioned\nsystem of high-level locks will have to be built in time to\nbegin operating by the year 2020. As it does not have the\nnecessary resources to complete such a project, Panama\nbelieves that the cooperation of the members of the\ninternational community - primarily those who use the Canal\n- is essential. We hope to receive that cooperation, for the\nsake of the well-being of the Panama Canal users who so\nurgently require it.\nAt the beginning of my statement I referred to the fact\nthat we are two years from the golden anniversary of this\nOrganization. We should prepare to celebrate that great\nevent by affirming, as its founders in San Francisco wished,\n\\\"faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth\nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and women\nand of nations large and small\\\" and by promoting \\\"social\nprogress\\\" and \\\"better standards of life in larger freedom\\\".\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by\ncongratulating you, Your Excellency Ambassador Samuel\nInsanally of the Republic of Guyana, upon your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly for this forty-eighth\nsession. Your well-known diplomatic skills and your\ncountry\u2019s long-established positions of principle augur well\nfor the successful conduct of the work of this session.\nI also wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan\nGanev of Bulgaria for the able manner in which he steered\nthe work of the Assembly during a particularly challenging\nforty-seventh session.\nMay I also take this opportunity to say a special word\nof congratulations to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on his outstanding stewardship\nof the United Nations during these critical times, when the\nworld body is increasingly being called upon to respond\npromptly and effectively to complex situations all over the\nworld.\nAs the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization\napproaches, there is great merit in our taking stock of what\nthe United Nations has achieved in the maintenance of peace\nand security and in fostering international cooperation for\ndevelopment. It is also our duty at this session to explore\nways and means of further strengthening this body so that it\nis better equipped to fulfil its purposes and principles as\nenshrined in the Charter.\nThe admission of new States to the community of\nnations upholds the principle of universality that we so much\ncherish. In this connection, it is important for us to take\nnote of and applaud the historic agreement that has been\nsigned by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,\nwhich heralds a period of peace after more than four decades\nof bitter and destructive fighting. It is our hope that one day\nthe State of Palestine will earn its deserved place as a\nMember of this Organization. We would, at the same time,\nlike to pay tribute to those countries and organizations that\nwere instrumental in bringing the negotiations to a fruitful\nconclusion.\nThe fact that the membership of this Organization has\nincreased dramatically to 184 surely suggests an urgent need\nto restructure it so that it serves the world community better\nin the vastly changed circumstances. The end of the cold-\nwar era has finally placed the United Nations at centre stage\nof international affairs for the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity and the strengthening of international cooperation in\nsocial and economic development.\nHowever, the arrangements made for the maintenance\nof international peace and security need a thorough review.\nAt a time when great emphasis is being placed on the\nprinciple of democracy at the national level, there is no valid\nreason for not extending the same principle to the sphere of\ninternational relations.\nThe principle of sovereign equality among States is an\nimportant provision of the Charter. The General Assembly\nand its style of work represent the embodiment of this\nimportant principle. It is the only organ that enjoys\nuniversality of membership; therefore, its relationship with\nother organs of the Organization should reflect this pre-\neminent status. Consequently, in the revitalization and\nrestructuring process, the end product should be a\nreinvigorated General Assembly capable of asserting itself in\nits relationship with other organs of the United Nations.\nThe Security Council is assigned by the Charter the\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. The recent proliferation of situations of\nconflict, instability and tension around the globe calls for\ngreater participation and involvement of the general\nmembership in the workings of the Council. There is\ntherefore need to adjust its membership, structure and\nmethods of work to reflect the changes which have occurred\nin international relations since 1945.\nThe first obvious change in our Organization is the\ndramatic increase in its membership. Consequently, the ratio\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security Council has\nprogressively declined from 5 to 1 in 1945, through 8 to 1\nin 1965, to 12 to 1 in 1993. Clearly, the Security Council\nhas become less representative and needs to be enlarged.\nThe second change relates to the configuration of power\nin political, economic and military terms which created the\nnotion of permanent membership and the veto in the\nCouncil. Present realities dictate that the privileges enjoyed\nby the permanent members of the Security Council be\nmodified and that the composition of the Council be altered,\nbut with due regard to the provisions of Article 23,\nparagraph, 1 of the Charter, which accords due importance\nto\n\\\"the contribution of Members of the United Nations to\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\nto the other purposes of the Organization\\\",\nsubject, of course, to membership that is democratically\nelected and fully accountable to the total membership of the\nOrganization on whose behalf the Security Council acts. It\nwill take time to negotiate and put the changes in place.\nHowever, in the intervening period there is nothing to\nprevent the Organization from implementing interim\nmeasures which may go some distance towards redressing\nthe present discrepancies.\nThe mere expansion of the membership of the Security\nCouncil will not amount to much for Africa, Latin America\nand Asia unless the question of equitable geographic\ndistribution is adequately addressed. At present, these three\nregions are grossly underrepresented, in terms of both non-\npermanent and permanent members. Africa and Latin\nAmerica do not even wield a single veto, whereas the Group\nof Western European and Other States, and Eastern Europe,\nnow wield four of the five vetoes in the Council. Moreover,\nthe Group of Western European and Other States, and\nEastern Europe, are allocated 7 of the 15 seats, leaving\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America to share the remaining 8, an\narrangement that is totally inequitable and therefore\nunacceptable.\nIt is clear that the Security Council, through a liberal\ninterpretation of the concept of international peace and\nsecurity, has encroached on the jurisdiction of other organs\nin the system. We are concerned by the apparent impression\noften created by the Council that majority votes in the\nCouncil constitute international law, regardless of the\nprovisions of the Charter and other relevant international\nstatutes.\nThe Security Council acts on behalf of the entire United\nNations membership. Therefore, any tendencies or practices\nthat may be interpreted as contradicting the norms and\nprinciples of transparency, accountability and democracy\nshould be avoided. To this end, we should evolve a system\nthat would ensure more participation by interested Member\nStates that are not members of the Security Council. This\nwill make it possible for such Members to have a\nmeaningful input during the informal meetings of the\nSecurity Council. It is also desirable that the Council keep\nthe general membership well informed regarding the stage\nand nature of discussions and negotiations undertaken.\nIf we have addressed ourselves at some length to the\nissue of the Security Council it is because the responsibilities\nit shoulders have manifestly increased in number and\ncomplexity. It is our view that only through a process of\ninternal institutional reform, which we believe is long\noverdue, can the moral authority and effectiveness of the\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 3\nSecurity Council in discharging its mandate be enhanced and\nacknowledged. It is our hope that the current negotiations\non this matter will be successfully concluded to coincide\nwith the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the\nfounding of the United Nations in 1995.\nI now turn to the vital role of the Assembly as the\ncentral and universal forum for deliberation. Africa fully\nsupports the efforts under way to revitalize and rationalize\nthe work of the General Assembly. We believe that the\nexercise must be comprehensive, taking into account the\nexpanded membership of the world body as well as the\nprinciple of sovereign equality of all States. The reform\nprocess must also fully address the need for the other\nprincipal organs of the United Nations system to report to\nthe General Assembly, as provided in the Charter.\nAs I have already noted, the tasks facing the United\nNations today have increased with the unprecedented\nmushrooming of peace-keeping operations all over the world.\nBitter armed conflicts continue to ravage lives and destroy\nproperty, stretching the much-needed administrative and\nfinancial resources of the Organization to the limit. Let us\ntherefore redouble our efforts in support of the increased\ncommitment and responsibilities of our Organization.\nThe recent successes of the United Nations in bringing\npeace to Cambodia, El Salvador and Haiti and in facilitating\nthe referendum in Eritrea are testimony to what can be\nachieved by our Organization acting in a concerted manner.\nIt is in this context that we particularly welcome the\nSecretary-General\u2019s proposals in his report \\\"An Agenda for\nPeace\\\", relating to cooperation between the United Nations\nand regional organizations in resolving conflicts, in\npeacemaking as well as peace building. We in Africa have\ntaken a positive step in this direction. At the thirtieth\nsummit meeting of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU),\nheld at Cairo in June this year, we adopted a mechanism\nwhose primary objective is the anticipation and prevention\nof conflicts. Its mandate will be guided by the principles of\nthe OAU Charter, in particular the sovereign equality of\nStates. Where conflicts have already occurred, the function\nof this mechanism will be peacemaking and peace building.\nEven with our meagre resources, we are proud to say that\nAfrica has already established a Special Fund to support\nOAU activities in conflict prevention and settlement.\nIn southern Africa we continue to be bedeviled by\nconflicts in Angola, Mozambique and South Africa. In\nMozambique, however, we welcome the recent talks between\nPresident Chissano and RENAMO leader Afondo Dhlakama,\nwhich have cleared some of the major obstacles to the peace\nprocess. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue\nits efforts to put the peace process back on schedule to\nenable elections to be held in October 1994.\nIn Angola we are gravely concerned at the continued\nescalation of fighting between UNITA and the legitimate\nMPLA Government. This has caused untold loss of life and\nproperty. We believe that the efforts of the United Nations\nand the OAU should be aimed at achieving a cease-fire\nbetween the two warring parties and creating favourable\ncircumstances for the deployment of United Nations peace-\nkeeping operations while negotiations for peace take place.\nUNITA should accept the results of the September 1992\ndemocratic elections, which were declared free and fair by\ninternational observers, including the United Nations.\nOn South Africa, we applaud and support the current\nnegotiations to bring about democratic change in that\ncountry, particularly the recent agreement regarding the\nfuture, and indeed ongoing, establishment of the Transitional\nExecutive Council. We are, however, dismayed to note the\nintensification of violence and the withdrawal of the Inkatha\nFreedom Party and the white conservatives from the\nnegotiations. These actions threaten the smooth progress\ntowards the goal of democratic elections currently set for\nApril 1994. We therefore urge the two parties to return to\nthe negotiating table, as this is the only way forward. The\nUnited Nations should also seriously consider a more active\nrole in the prevention of violence.\nThe President of the African National Congress (ANC)\nhas appealed to the United Nations for the ending of\nsanctions against South Africa, and we are glad that there\nhas been response from a number of countries to that appeal.\nZimbabwe fully supports the appeal, and we are glad that a\nstage has now been reached when we can judge the process\nto be more or less irreversible.\nIn Somalia we commend the efforts of the United\nNations in the difficult mission to restore normalcy to that\ntortured country. In Liberia and Rwanda, while peace has\nremained elusive, we are glad that current OAU and United\nNations efforts to resolve the crises have begun to bear fruit.\nIt is our hope that recent positive developments on the long-\nstanding question of Western Sahara will result in a just and\nequitable settlement. The untiring efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations in seeking lasting solutions\nto these conflicts on our continent and elsewhere,\nparticularly those emanating from the disintegration of the\nformer Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, deserve our\nunqualified support.\n4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nAs equal members of this family of nations, we believe\nthat peace-keeping, peace-building and peacemaking must\nnot be the preserve of a few economically or politically\npowerful countries. We stand ready to cooperate with the\ninternational community in seeking solutions to the many\nproblems facing the world today, by participating in peace-\nkeeping operations or mediation efforts, or by providing any\nfacilities or expertise at our disposal. However, unless all\nMember States commit themselves to timely payments of\ntheir assessed contributions for these efforts, some countries\nwill find continued participation difficult.\nWe are fully aware that issues involving violent\ndisputes or armed conflicts are not the only concerns of the\ninternational community. Other issues, such as trade and\neconomic growth, as well as international cooperation for\ndevelopment, are matters of primary concern. We note with\nconcern from the World Economic Survey, 1993 that for the\nthird year in succession the rate of growth of world output\nin 1993 will be below that of world population. It is also\nevident from the Survey that the end of the East-West\nideological divide has not brought with it a commensurate\nnarrowing of the economic disparities between North and\nSouth. Instead, these disparities have become more\npronounced than ever before.\nThe problems confronting the developing countries\ntoday are manifold. Terms of trade continue to deteriorate,\nas high prices of imported manufactured goods and rising\nprotectionism in developed countries become the order of the\nday. The socio-economic crisis in the developing countries\nhas been further exacerbated by the crippling burden of debt.\nThe flows of official development assistance, upon which\nthey are dependent, has declined in recent years, while direct\ninvestment has constituted only a marginal percentage of all\ninflows to these countries, particularly those in Africa.\nIn Africa, the least developed and most marginalized of\nall the world\u2019s regions, the majority of countries are\nundertaking economic reform measures. They have made\ngreat sacrifices and encountered untold difficulties in\nimplementing these reforms. In southern and eastern Africa\nin particular, the capacity to implement and keep these\neconomic reforms on course was further undermined by the\ndevastating drought which swept the region in 1991-1992.\nYet these countries have continued to demonstrate their\ncommitment to the reforms aimed at improving the standard\nof living of their people.\nOur sacrifices alone are not enough to ensure the\nsuccess of our economic reform programmes. In this regard,\nwe must once again reiterate the imperative need for an open\nand equitable international trading system and the provision\nof adequate financial resources. We therefore call for an\nearly conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade\nNegotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n(GATT). We also call again on the developed countries to\nachieve without further delay the target of 0.7 per cent of\ntheir gross national product for official development\nassistance that was set over 24 years ago by this very\nAssembly.\nAfrica\u2019s economic and social progress in general, and\nin the context of the implementation of the New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s in particular, will\nremain severely hampered as long as the continent\u2019s debt\nburden continues to be as acute as it is today. Standing at\nclose to $290 billion at the end of 1992, the continent\u2019s debt\nis equivalent to 100.1 per cent of its gross national product,\nwhile it is an alarming 108 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa.\nWith Africa continuing to be a net exporter of financial\nresources, is it any wonder that many of our human\ndevelopment needs and social services have gone unmet?\nWe believe that there is a clear and compelling need to\nfind a lasting solution to Africa\u2019s indebtedness. While we\nwelcome some of the positive steps taken by some creditor\ncountries towards debt relief, as well as the important\ninitiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions in this regard,\nwe believe that an unacceptable gap still remains between\nrhetoric and action, and that more decisive measures can be\ntaken to address this crisis.\nAfrica believes that the commitment it made together\nwith the international community, when the New Agenda\nwas adopted in 1991, must be renewed and translated into\nconcrete action. Fully cognizant of the fact that Africa\u2019s\ndevelopment is primarily our responsibility, we have\nproceeded courageously to implement our side of the\ncommitment, particularly in the promotion of regional and\nsub-regional economic cooperation and integration and the\ncreation of an enabling environment for foreign and\ndomestic investment. We therefore call upon the\ninternational community to buttress our efforts by addressing\nin a concerted manner the major constraints which I have\nhighlighted.\nAfrica does not seek charity. Mindful of the need to\npromote sustainable and self-sustaining development on the\nbasis of self-reliance and the interdependence of Member\nStates, the countries of Southern Africa signed in August\n1992 a regional treaty establishing the Southern Africa\nDevelopment Community (SADC). Foremost among our\nobjectives are the achievement - through regional\nForty-eighth session - 28 September l993 5\nintegration - of development and economic growth, the\nalleviation of poverty, the enhancement of the standard and\nquality of life and the support of the socially disadvantaged.\nThrough the various regional economic organizations\nsuch as the Eastern and Southern African Preferential Trade\nArea (PTA), the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), and the Arab Maghreb Union, African\ncountries are trying to further their aim of achieving self-\nsustaining development. These efforts will eventually\nculminate in the formation of an African Economic\nCommunity, whose foundations have already been laid.\nFurthermore, it is our objective to evolve common political\nvalues, systems and institutions, and to promote and defend\npeace and security in the region. It is our earnest hope that\nthe international community as well as organs of the United\nNations system and the multilateral financial institutions will\ncontinue to render their invaluable and generous assistance\nin order to ensure the success of our regional integration\nefforts.\nZimbabwe is fully committed to achieving the\nsustainable utilization of our natural resources and the\nprotection of our environment in order to attain sustainable\ndevelopment. In this context, we note with appreciation the\nprogress made so far in establishing the institutional\nmechanism for the follow-up of the decisions taken during\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June last year. In\nparticular, we commend the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment for the constructive and positive manner in\nwhich it conducted its work during its first substantive\nsession in June.\nWe welcome the stress that the Commission has placed\non some of the areas critical to the successful\nimplementation of Agenda 21, including the urgent need to\nsupport national efforts to achieve sustainable consumption\nand production patterns and lifestyles and the need for a\nsupportive international economic environment.\nIssues such as the alleviation and reduction of poverty,\nthe creation of remunerative and productive employment and\nsocial integration are at the core of the endeavours of all\ncountries, but more urgently of developing countries. It is\nappropriate that these constitute the basis of our deliberations\nwhen we convene in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 1995\nfor the World Summit for Social Development.\nThese themes are all equally vital. It is gratifying that\nthe international community has pronounced itself on them\non many occasions as indeed have States individually and\nseverally. The theme of social integration, for example, was\naddressed in a special way when two years ago we held a\nsummit meeting on children here in New York. We adopted\nprinciples and guidelines which should govern the treatment\nand development of children in all our countries. We\nshould, in translating these principles into practice, work to\nremove the status and stigma of society\u2019s marginal people\nfrom our children. The children are our future. We have a\nduty to the future for them by the positive and practical\nmeasures we take today for their protection, education and\ndevelopment.\nOf great importance to us also are issues of population\nand the advancement of women. In this context we\nwelcome and support the convening of the World\nConference on Population and Development in 1994 in\nCairo, Egypt, and of the World Conference on Women in\nBeijing, China, in 1995.\nIn this regard let me underscore the conclusion of the\nWorld Economic Survey 1993 that the social concerns of\ndeveloping countries, and the major issues of development\nin other areas of the world, cannot be resolved in the\nabsence of world economic growth. It is our fervent hope\nthat just as the United Nations has considerably strengthened\nits role in the political and humanitarian fields, its role in the\neconomic, social and related fields will likewise be\nstrengthened in order adequately to meet the emerging new\nrealities and their impact on the developing countries.\nLet me conclude by calling upon all Member States to\nremember that just as the new international situation dictates\nthe need to strengthen, democratize and streamline the\noperations of the United Nations and its constituent bodies,\nso also is it incumbent upon us to make an exceptional\ncontribution in pursuit of the noble goals of justice, peace\nand development. This we believe can be achieved only if\nall Members live up to their obligations under the Charter.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, the delegation of St. Vincent and the\nGrenadines welcomes your election to preside over the work\nof the General Assembly at this its forty-eighth session. By\nyour elevation to this exceedingly demanding position, the\nGeneral Assembly has acknowledged your well-known\npersonal merits, proven ability and professional skills. I am\nconfident that you will guide this session to a successful\nconclusion of the business before us.\nYour country, Guyana, shares a number of common\ninterests and affinities with St. Vincent and the Grenadines\nand other sister States in the Latin American and Caribbean\nregion. It is therefore with a deep sense of pride that we\ncongratulate you on your unanimous election and pledge the\nfull cooperation of the delegation of St. Vincent and the\nGrenadines throughout the difficult and challenging period\nahead.\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines was pleased to be in the\nChair in August 1992 when the Group of Latin American\nand Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) unanimously endorsed\nthe Caribbean candidature for the Presidency of the General\nAssembly at its forty-eighth session. It was the first time\nthat the Group had so acted, and I wish to congratulate all\nthose who were involved in the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) effort, and to thank all member states of the\nGRULAC for their cooperation. We in CARICOM are\nsteadfast in our commitments, and this demonstration of\nhemispheric solidarity augurs well for continued\nstrengthening of our ties, not only in placing candidates in\nimportant positions in the international arena, but even more\ncritically in promoting and securing the best interests of our\nmember countries in the post-cold-war world.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our deep\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, former\nForeign Minister of Bulgaria, for the able and inspired\nmanner in which he guided the work of the General\nAssembly at its forty-seventh session .\nI wish also to thank the Secretary-General,\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the extraordinary role he is\nplaying in shaping the future of the international system.\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\nrepresentatives of the States newly admitted to membership\nof the United Nations, namely, the Czech Republic,\nSlovakia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,\nEritrea, the Principality of Monaco, and Andorra. We\nparticularly wish to congratulate the people of Eritrea on\nwinning the long battle for their self-determination, and we\nexpress the hope that their diligence in the pursuit of\npolitical independence will be combined with an appropriate\nstrategy for economic achievement.\nThe admission of a nation to this body always marks a\nsignificant event in the international arena as it takes us\nanother step forward towards the objective of universal\nrepresentation.\nAdherence to the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter and the right of the world\u2019s peoples to self-\ndetermination are the main barometers used in the admission\nof States to membership of this body of nations. However,\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, a nation of over\n21 million inhabitants, which today has one of the most\nvigorous economies in the world, is excluded from\nmembership of the United Nations. In this post-cold-war\nera, when a number of countries which once had a single\nidentity and representation in this Organization now find\nready admission as separate and sovereign members, it is\nappropriate that all States capable of maintaining such\nsovereign identity be so recognized. Moreover, the Republic\nof China on Taiwan has demonstrated its capacity to be in\nthe forefront of world economic development and should be\nprovided with an opportunity to participate in, and contribute\nto, the programmes of the United Nations.\nMy delegation heralds the signing of the United\nNations- brokered Governors Island Accord last July by\nPresident Aristide and the military-backed Government of\nHaiti, headed by General Raoul Cedras, as an historic\nopportunity for the Haitian people, the hemisphere, and the\nprinciple of democratic rule. The interim period until\nPresident Aristide\u2019s return to Haiti on the 30th of this month\nmust be a time for healing and laying the groundwork for a\nsmooth take-over, and for a concerted rehabilitation process\naimed at bringing some measure of economic and political\nstability to that long-suffering country.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate our\nsolidarity with the Haitian people, who have struggled over\nthe past months amidst persistent and blatant human rights\nabuses and political repression. We hail the efforts and\ninitiatives taken by the United Nations, the Organization of\nAmerican States, and the Government of the United States\nof America in bringing the usurpation of authority to an end.\nLet us pray that the clear message from the resolution of the\nHaitian crisis by international response will halt the\nambitions of the various military aspirants there.\nAs the United Nations moves to perform its\npeace-keeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcing roles in\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 7\nmany troubled areas around the world, harassment, beatings\nand murder of its personnel, both civilian and military, are\non the rise. Earlier in the year a number of United Nations\npersonnel in the Middle East and Cambodia were slain.\nThese killings followed the murder of a nurse working with\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in Gaza and of a\nUnited Nations driver in Afghanistan. This year the world\nhas also been shocked by the deaths of a number of\nPakistanis, Italians, Moroccans, Americans and nationals of\nother countries serving in the United Nations Operation in\nSomalia (UNOSOM).\nMy Government takes this opportunity to express its\ncondolences to the Governments and peoples of those\ncountries whose nationals paid the ultimate price in their\ndesire to bring peace and deliver humanitarian assistance to\nthe suffering peoples of the world. We also wish to express\nour sympathy to the bereaved families of all those United\nNations personnel who died in the line of duty. Member\nStates must be reminded of their responsibility to protect\nUnited Nations workers and of their obligation to act\npromptly and effectively to deter, prosecute and punish all\nthose responsible for violence.\nWe salute the courage and commitment of those\ndedicated people who continue to accept considerable\npersonal risks in order to carry out United Nations missions.\nThe international community must take appropriate steps to\nprotect its members and we eagerly await the submission of\nconcrete proposals designed to enhance the safety and\nsecurity of United Nations forces and personnel.\nIt is evident that the perceived disarray in the United\nNations military operation in Somalia is fuelling instability\nin the country and detracting from the achievement of the\noriginal goals of restoring peace and security and ensuring\nthe distribution of humanitarian relief, thereby paving the\nway for the re-establishment of civil society in the country\nat large. Naturally, these objectives cannot be achieved\nunless the international community continues to work in\nearnest to ensure that disarmament is achieved throughout\nthe country in conformity with the provisions of the Addis\nAbaba agreement of March 1993, to which all factions are\nsignatories.\nIn this regard, my delegation is of the view that\nappropriate measures must be taken against those who\ncontinue to impede disarmament, in direct contravention of\nSecurity Council resolutions and the Addis Ababa\nagreement. My delegation welcomes signs of a willingness\nto negotiate on the part of rebel forces.\nFrom this point on all actions by the United Nations in\nSomalia should be aimed at winning the trust of the Somali\npeople as a prerequisite to the re-establishment of peace and\nsecurity, national reconciliation, restoration of the Somali\nState and the reconstruction and development of the country.\nMy delegation congratulates the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization (PLO), under the leadership of Mr. Yasser\nArafat, on concluding an agreement with the Rabin\nGovernment of Israel to end hostilities among their peoples.\nWe see this as a significant first step that will fail unless it\nleads to the implementation of the resolutions long agreed to\nin the United Nations on the territories occupied by Israel\nand the acceptance by the United Nations of Palestine to\nmembership. Just as my delegation has persistently endorsed\nthe right of Israel to exist within secure borders, we assert\nthe same right for Palestine. At the forty-fifth session of the\nAssembly, when we were discussing the invasion of Kuwait,\nmy delegation called on this body to demonstrate consistency\nin responding to its resolutions, and we do so again.\nWe wish to congratulate the Government of Norway on\nthe pivotal and historic facilitating role they played in the\nprocess of mediating in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. We\nadmire the dignified manner of their contribution and\nsubsequent response.\nThe rapidly deteriorating situation in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina cries out for urgent resolution. The state of\naffairs cannot be tolerated much longer. Immeasurable harm\nin both human and material terms has already been done,\nand the Serbs and Croats appear to be bent on the\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina through border\nchanges, by force and by ethnic cleansing. The international\ncommunity cannot agree to a solution dictated by the Serbs\nand Croats at the expense of the Bosnian Muslims. We also\ncannot accept any territorial solution unless it has the\nagreement of the three parties. My delegation wishes to\nstate unequivocally that the measures necessary to bring\nabout a reversal of the Serbian aggression must include the\nimmediate immobilization of heavy weapons, placing them\nunder effective international control, and the effective\nenforcement of comprehensive sanctions on the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia until all the conditions in the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions are met. My\ndelegation calls on all those with the resources to influence\na return to normality in this part of the world to honour their\nmoral responsibility.\nThe end of the cold war has resulted in a new spirit of\ncooperation between erstwhile enemies. Ongoing\n8 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nrestructuring of the world body is designed to enhance the\ncapacity of the Organization for preventive diplomacy,\npeace-keeping and peacemaking. Regrettably, these changes\ndo not mean the end of bloody regional conflicts. The strife\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nagorny Karabakh and Liberia\ncontinues. In Angola, Sudan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan\nthere is conflict and distress.\nThe demands on the United Nations for peace-keeping\nand peace-building are increasing daily in the number of\noperations and personnel as well as in the scope of their\nmandates. But in order to bring peace and security to these\ntroubled areas the international community must redouble its\nefforts to bring about a resolution of their conflicts.\nOne of my country\u2019s most important priorities is\nsupport for the right of all peoples living under colonial or\nalien domination and/or foreign occupation to self-\ndetermination and independence. Stressing our commitment\nto the goal of the complete eradication of colonialism, we\nonce again pledge to strengthen our solidarity with all those\ncountries facing aggression or intervention or interference in\ntheir internal affairs.\nConsistent with this position, we strongly condemn the\ncontinuous efforts of certain segments of South African\nsociety to perpetuate the system of apartheid. At the same\ntime, we welcome the recent progress towards the\nestablishment of a non-racial democracy, paving the way for\nthe first non-racial elections, scheduled for April 1994, and\nthe eventual reintegration of that country into the\ninternational political and economic community.\nWe welcome the adoption by acclamation on Friday, 8\nOctober, of the General Assembly resolution in support of\nMr. Nelson Mandela\u2019s call for the immediate lifting of\nsanctions against South Africa.\nThe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is\nparticularly pleased that four vital pieces of legislation,\nsetting up, the Independent Electoral Commission, the\nIndependent Media Commission, the Independent\nBroadcasting Authority and the Transitional Executive\nCouncil have been adopted by both the Negotiating Council\nand the South African Parliament, and are in the process of\nbeing enacted into law.\nWith the changing world environment the Organization\nhas been catapulted into new prominence and there has been\nrenewed hope, and high expectation, as well as new ideas on\nthe functioning of the General Assembly. The same\nmovement of change is also of vital importance in the\nSecurity Council and in the economic and social fields. Let\nus not lose the momentum in our quest to give new life to\nthe Organization.\nThe General Assembly is a body that has been\nfunctioning below the capacity envisaged by its founding\nfathers. On the other hand, we have a Security Council that\nhas expanded in scope and power without a corresponding\nincrease in its membership or a reorganization of its\nfunctions. The need has also been established for\nstrengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council\nthrough a better distribution of its functions and a\nrationalization of its activities.\nMy delegation is of the view that at a minimum the\nSecurity Council should be expanded to allocate permanent\nseats to Japan and Germany and up to six new rotating seats\nto be filled on a regional basis in order better to reflect the\nincreased membership of the United Nations and the\nchanged international situation. Certainly, we do not grant\nto Japan and Germany the recognition they richly deserve.\nThe Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit was about nations\njoining together in common resolve to do a better job in the\nfuture and to offer our children the hope for a brighter\ntomorrow. The centrepiece of this international effort,\nAgenda 2l, is a blueprint for our planet which the\nGovernments of the world adopted by acclamation. With the\ncreation of a Commission on Sustainable Development and\nthe restructuring of the economic and social functions of the\nUnited Nations, we now have the institutional arrangements\nin place to ensure that the measures prescribed by Agenda\n21 are adequately addressed.\nIn the interim between Rio and the convening of the\nfirst substantial session of the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment, it appeared to many that the spirit of Rio was\nbeginning to fade away, due in part to the failure of the\nindustrialized countries to make firm financial commitments\nto the programme approved at UNCED. There is, however,\nrenewed hope because, since the June session of the\nCommission, machinery has been firmly put in place to\nfollow up on pledges made at the Rio Summit.\nThe establishment by the Commission of two working\ngroups to tackle the thorny issues of financial flows and\ntechnology transfer to the developing countries of the South,\nin addition to reviewing mechanisms for innovative financing\nof Agenda 21 and for analysing conditions that determine the\nflow of financial and economic resources, such as debt\nrelief, terms of trade and commodity prices, is a positive\napproach, and it should give new impetus to the\nForty-eighth session - 12 October l993 9\nimplementation of the global plan which the Rio Summit\nadopted to protect the world from environmental degradation\nthrough the twenty-first century. We wish to thank those\nwho have contributed to the Global Environment Facility,\nwhich makes grant funding available to poor countries so\nthat they may properly shoulder their share of environmental\nresponsibilities in our global community.\nAs we observe new trends in the world economy, it is\nnoteworthy that there is potentially greater capacity for\ngrowth of real consumption in developing countries than in\nthe developed ones. Those of us who live in small island\nStates have limited options in response to the international\neconomic environment. The banana industry, which is the\nlifeline of our economies in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines and the other countries of the Windward Islands,\nis currently under threat of extinction. My delegation wishes\nto record, at this session of the General Assembly, our\ngratitude to the European Economic Community for its\nsupport for this vital component of our economies.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small developing\narchipelagic State, with all the generic circumstances\nassociated with small size, limited resources, geographical\ndispersion and relative isolation from markets. Naturally we\nalso have advantages, which we continue to exploit in the\nnational interest. Development in all its forms is of\nparamount national importance to us. In this regard, we\nlook forward with enthusiasm to the World Summit for\nSocial Development in 1995, the International Conference on\nPopulation and Development in 1994, and the Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, which is scheduled to convene in\nBarbados in 1994. It is our fervent hope that the\ninternational community will recognize the special\ncharacteristics and developmental needs of this category of\ncountries, which have not changed in the new configuration\nof world politics. We pray also that there will be tangible\nbenefits following the conclusion of these Conferences.\nThe United Nations has designated 1993 the\nInternational Year for the World\u2019s Indigenous People.\nForced off their ancestral lands by settlers and colonizers,\nindigenous peoples in many parts of the world have faced\nuntold discrimination and poverty and are often afforded\nlittle say in their political future. It is no surprise, therefore,\nthat they are increasingly seeking to exercise their full range\nof human rights. The world\u2019s communities are urged to\ntreat minorities and indigenous peoples, and persons\nbelonging to them, on the basis of equality, and to take\nmeasures that would, inter alia, facilitate their full\nparticipation in all aspects of the political, economic, social,\nreligious and cultural life of the society.\nMy delegation is proud to state that in Saint Vincent\nand the Grenadines the indigenous people, the Caribs, are\nfully integrated into Vincentian society and are beneficiaries\nof all rights and freedoms under our Constitution. They\nparticipate fully in the political process, and today an active\nrepresentative in the House of Assembly is a descendant of\nJoseph Chatoyer, the Paramount Chief of the Caribs and a\nnational hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Our\nGovernment has also taken specific steps, through its land\nreform and distribution policy, to empower the Caribs, who\nare the main beneficiaries of the Government\u2019s acquisition\nof the area formerly occupied by Orange Hill Estates, and\nthe subsequent distribution, with title, of economically viable\nplots to them.\nMy Government will ensure that our indigenous people\ncontinue to participate fully in national society and that their\nviews are solicited and taken into consideration in\ndecision-making processes that affect them and the nation as\na whole.\nMy delegation is proud to co-sponsor a draft resolution\nof the Standing Committee of Caribbean Ministers\nResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the Caribbean\nCommunity calling for the annual observance of an\nInternational Day of Indigenous Peoples. I hope that this\ndraft resolution, when brought before this body, will be\nadopted by acclamation and will receive unanimous\nfollow-up support from Member countries.\nThe Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nwelcomes and values highly the deepening of relations\nbetween the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Latin\nAmerica in general. We are also encouraged by the degree\nof cooperation which is being developed between\nCARICOM and Central America. In the increasingly\ncompetitive world environment, which is gradually being\ndominated by large trading blocs, it is imperative for our\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean to forge closer\nties through economic and other forms of functional\ncooperation.\nMy Government totally condemns the illicit production,\ntrafficking in and consumption of drugs. These harbingers\nof violent crime and corruption pose a serious threat to the\nhealth and well-being of our economies and our people,\nendanger our democratic institutions and jeopardize national\nand regional security.\n10 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe are firmly convinced that only integrated regional\nand international efforts can effectively address the drug\nproblem, and, accordingly, we stress the need for increased\nlocal, regional and international cooperation. Greater\nemphasis should be placed on programmes that generate\nemployment and income for persons attracted to drug\nproduction and trafficking as a means of livelihood. These\nshould be pursued concurrently with programmes for the\nprevention of drug use and the rehabilitation of drug users.\nThe appropriate measures must also be taken to strengthen\nour judicial institutions to ensure that the perpetrators of\ndrug abuse and related crimes are brought to swift and\neffective justice.\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are closely\nobserving the evolution of democracy in the States of\nEastern Europe and the territories of the former Soviet\nUnion, as well as its consolidation worldwide. We agonized\nwith freedom-loving peoples when the Russian constitutional\ncrisis threatened to \\\"put democracy under a shade.\\\" We\nregret the loss of life that resulted from the struggle for\ncontrol, and we hope that the emergence of a full- fledged\nsystem of democracy, with the ultimate power residing in the\nhands of the people, will not be impeded by any self-serving\nacts on the part of major players.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the\nconstitutional resolution of the political impasse in Pakistan.\nAs a member of the Commonwealth, we welcome Mrs.\nBenazir Bhutto back as Prime Minister of her country and\nlook forward to meeting her in Cyprus at the Commonwealth\nHeads of Government meeting.\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its resolute\ncommitment to the democratic ideal and the concomitant\nfree enterprise system. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,\nlike the other countries of CARICOM, has gone through a\nhistoric constitutional journey, from Crown Colony\nGovernment, with its limited franchise, to full political\nindependence under universal adult suffrage. We have\nadhered to the principles and practice of participatory\ndemocracy and the market economy, even when these ideals\nwere not as pervasive and mandatory as they are today. We\nhave stayed the course, by choice and conviction, and our\npeople have reaped the benefits. They will have it no other\nway.\nIn this post-cold-war era we are determined to maintain\nthe gains of our democracy which we have accumulated over\nthe years, even as we face the increasing difficulties\nassociated with the marginalization of small States in the\nface of bloc consolidation and other emerging trends of our\ntime.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to\nextend to the President of the General Assembly at this\nforty-eighth session my sincere congratulations on his\nelection. He was unanimously supported for this position\nbecause of his excellent qualities; and his election is also a\ntribute to his country, Guyana.\nMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, our Secretary-General, also\ndeserves our wholehearted thanks and appreciation for his\nconstant and resolute efforts in implementing the decisions\nof our Organization and applying the principles of our\nCharter.\nThe already very broad universality of the United\nNations has been further strengthened - and I welcome this -\nwith the admission of six new countries: the Czech\nRepublic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, The Former\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and Andorra.\nMr. Willy Claes, the Belgian Minister for Foreign\nAffairs, yesterday expressed the views of the European\nCommunity and its member States. I shall therefore be able\nin this statement to focus on a few matters of particular\nconcern to my Government.\nThree years ago, from this very rostrum, we welcomed\nthe end of the East-West confrontation and its corollary, the\nend of the threat of nuclear annihilation. Throughout the\nworld, democracy and respect for the state of law were\nprogressing in a most encouraging way. But given\ndevelopments in the last few years, it would seem that we\nshould somehow dampen our enthusiasm.\nChanges in the balance of forces between the Powers\nthat dominated the old order have allowed nationalism and\nregionalism to develop. In some cases, this has led to the\ndestabilization of entire regions following upon rivalries\nbetween neighbors, ethnic tension and religious fanaticism.\nNationalism is of course not in and of itself evil. It is\nin some sense a logical manifestation of feelings of pride\nand self-confidence which can finally express themselves\nafter long years of oppression during which free speech was\nforcibly repressed.\nBut once the legitimate expression of this regained\npride of a people is transformed into open hostility towards\neverything that is different, then nationalism carries within\nitself the seeds of grave danger.\nExtreme nationalism can be seen in many places,\nwhether it be in the territory of the former Soviet Union or\nthe former Yugoslavia, where it has found its most\nintolerable expression. It leads to explosions of violence,\narmed aggression, acts of terrorism and unspeakable\nsuffering for the civilian populations.\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 31\nEthnic conflicts are proliferating in all regions of the\nworld. In Western Europe itself, it can be seen in the\nresurgence of racist and xenophobic incidents.\nAs a challenge to the primacy of law and to respect for\nhuman rights, extreme nationalism constitutes a threat to the\ninternational order.\nA clear and coherent strategy is necessary to respond to\nthis challenge.\nFirst of all, education with regard to tolerance should be\nrenewed; and, secondly, legal protection for minorities must\nbe ensured.\nThe principles and rules drawn up in this area by the\nCouncil of Europe and the Conference on Security and\nCooperation in Europe might suggest some solutions. New\ninstruments are to be defined next week at the summit of the\nCouncil of Europe. The plan for stability in Europe is part\nof this same approach.\nThirdly - and this is the most important action to be\ntaken - we must do everything possible at the national,\nregional and international levels to strengthen\ndemocratization and to promote protection for human rights.\nIt is on the basis of these principles, focused on the free\nexpression of peoples and the development of democratic\nstructures, that the United Nations has proposed solutions\nand agreements to resolve the conflicts which are being\nsubmitted to it in ever-increasing numbers.\nThe Government of Luxembourg expresses its deep\nsatisfaction over the agreement on mutual recognition and\nthe agreement on the autonomy of occupied territories\nconcluded between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation\nOrganization.\nWe should like to pay tribute to those who forged the\nagreements, in particular Prime Minister Rabin, his Foreign\nMinister Peres and President Arafat. They have given the\nworld a lesson in courage and clarity of vision and in\npolitical realism as well.\nThe developments we have witnessed are of a historic\nsignificance comparable to that of the collapse of the Berlin\nWall. They fundamentally change the facts of the Middle\nEast; they have launched a process of reconciliation in order\nto put an end to an explosive, untenable and unjust situation.\nIn a region devastated by more than 40 years of war,\nviolence and hatred, a window is now opening on a more\npeaceful and democratic future. The still fragile dynamic\nthat has been created must be strengthened without delay.\nThis can first be achieved by the conclusion of peace\nagreements between Israel and its neighbours: Lebanon,\nJordan and Syria. The Government of Luxembourg\nencourages the leaders concerned to overcome the last\nobstacles and to open the way to normalization of their\nrelations with Israel.\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians must then act together\nand in good faith, with the solidarity of the regional and\ninternational community to implement successfully the\nagreement on autonomy in the occupied territories, the first\nstep towards a comprehensive settlement. The first\ncontributor of funds, the European Community and its\nmember States, is prepared to increase cooperation on behalf\nof a population that must be helped to emerge from poverty\nand build a more dignified and prosperous future. Our\nGovernment will participate fully in that effort.\nThanks to the United Nations, peace was restored in\nNamibia and Nicaragua three years ago.\nToday in Cambodia the effort led by the United Nations\nhas enabled the people of an ancient culture, humiliated by\ndecades of bloody oppression and foreign occupation, to\nparticipate on a mass scale in free and open elections. By\nconsolidating a State of law and national reconciliation, the\ncountry will be able to rebuild itself.\nIn Haiti a firm policy of close cooperation between the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of American States\n(OAS) has led to an agreement which provides for the\nrestoration of democracy.\nIn El Salvador the assistance of the United Nations was\ndecisive in putting an end to the civil war and recommencing\nthe construction of a civilian society and the process of\nnational reconciliation. Free elections in which all\nSalvadorians will be able to participate are to be held next\nyear.\nIn Somalia, however, intervention by the United\nNations has demonstrated the limits of armed intervention in\na tribal civil war in the absence of a political agreement and\na cease-fire. Nevertheless, the difficulties encountered in\nMogadishu should not make us forget that the United\nNations made an essential contribution to combating the\nfamine.\n32 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nIn South Africa further decisive progress is being made\ntowards the definitive abolition of apartheid. I welcome the\nagreement on setting up a transitional body to draw up a\nprovisional Constitution and prepare for free elections in\nApril 1994. Only a shared determination and close\ncooperation between all the parties will make it possible to\nstop the deadly violence which continues to kill and which\njeopardizes the process of reconciliation.\nSignificant progress towards restoring democracy and\ntowards national reconciliation has also been made in other\ncountries in Central America and in Africa.\nThose achievements, however imperfect, are\nencouraging, and demonstrate the role that our Organization\ncan play in preserving peace and consolidating democratic\nregimes.\nThe situation in the former Yugoslavia is still extremely\ndisturbing. Every day we see on television the barbarism\nthat accompanies \\\"ethnic cleansing\\\" and the bloodstained\ndismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina -a country which\nwas once an example of ethnic and religious coexistence.\nThe agreement between the three Bosnian parties,\nwhich has yet to be finalized, is admittedly complex and far\nfrom perfect. Yet it has the merit of opening up the\nprospect of putting an end to terror and violence. It offers\na comprehensive arrangement for emerging from the crisis.\nIts success, which is far from being assured, presupposes a\nreal desire on the part of the three parties to reach agreement\nand to carry out and abide by what is signed. The European\nCommunity and its member States, where necessary assisted\nby the Western European Union (WEU), are ready to\ncontribute to implementation of the agreement, in\ncooperation with the United Nations, the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization (NATO) and the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Sanctions could be\nlifted when the various Security Council resolutions on the\nformer Yugoslavia have been implemented and when a\nsatisfactory solution to the problem of minorities has been\nfound.\nOverall, our Organization\u2019s peace-keeping activities\nhave reached an unprecedented level. Almost 80,000 Blue\nHelmets, military and civilian, are in the field in an\nunparalleled number of humanitarian missions and peace-\nkeeping operations. I pay tribute to all those who serve the\ncause of peace and in particular to those who have lost their\nlives during these actions. We have a duty to ensure better\nsecurity for personnel.\nLuxembourg, itself born as a modern State of an\ninternational treaty guaranteed by the Powers of the time, is\nparticularly sensitive to the need for security and the need to\npreserve the peace. It has therefore contributed actively to\nUnited Nations peace-keeping operations, sending military\npersonnel and making suitable financial contributions. My\nGovernment intends to continue this cooperation in the\nfuture.\nLuxembourg also firmly supports the efforts to step up\nUnited Nations activities in the area of preventive\ndiplomacy. These efforts must be increased. Measures such\nas fact-finding missions, the use of rapid alert systems, the\nestablishment of a rapid deployment group, and a\nreinforcement of the roles of regional organizations could all\nbe very useful in preventing conflict. Once a conflict has\nbeen unleashed it requires a much more costly intervention\nto ensure the restoration of peace.\nNew cooperation is developing between the United\nNations and regional organizations, which will increasingly\nbe called upon to carry out peace-keeping functions at their\nlevel or to support and supplement United Nations activities\nin the area of collective security. The WEU, of which my\ncountry currently holds the presidency, is in the course of\ndefining its role in peace-keeping operations. NATO and the\nCSCE are doing likewise.\nThe preservation of peace and the promotion of\ndemocracy and the rule of law go hand in hand with the\nprotection of human rights.\nOver the years, our Organization has succeeded in\ndeveloping and progressively codifying human rights. But\nthat is not enough; we must also see to it that these rights\nare better respected. The annual reports of organizations\ninvolved in the defence of human rights show that we are\nstill far from attaining that objective.\nWe are pleased that the Vienna Conference on Human\nRights allowed encouraging progress to be made. The\nuniversality of human rights was clearly affirmed. Specific\nproposals were made for ensuring broader knowledge of\nhuman rights, promoting them and respecting them. It is\nnow for this Assembly to approve those proposals, including\nthe establishment of a High Commissioner for Human\nRights.\nThere is an indissoluble link between respect for human\nrights and the promotion of democracy. Within the United\nNations system this link takes concrete form in the\nOrganization\u2019s growing activities in the area of technical\nForty-eighth session - 29 September l993 33\nassistance and international supervision of electoral\nprocesses. I support the proposals by our Secretary-General\nto broaden these support activities to include the\nestablishment of a free press, political parties and an\nindependent judiciary.\nIn this context, I welcome the decision taken by\nPresident Yeltsin to organize free elections in order to ensure\ndemocratic legitimacy for all State bodies in Russia.\nThe United Nations must also increase its activities in\nthe economic, social and environmental areas. This will also\nrequire the continued courageous reform of its structures and\nworking methods.\nWe can have no lasting peace while peoples are\nsubjected to abject poverty and famine and while they have\nno hope for progress towards greater justice and equality.\nCooperation and trade: these are the two foci of a single\npolicy, which must be followed. In the past few years my\nGovernment has doubled the aid it designates for\ndevelopment and cooperation. We are in favour of the swift\nconclusion of a balanced agreement in the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Such an\nagreement can provide at the world level a new impetus to\ntrade and economic relations.\nFollowing the Rio Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment, the new Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment must be determined to ensure that the\ncommitments entered into at that Conference are followed\nup.\nThe world\u2019s population has more than doubled over the\npast 40 years and according to estimates will double again\nin the next 30 years. The international community must\nengage in a thorough analysis of the consequences of that\nlevel of growth - for example, the problems of refugees,\nurban concentration, and the enormous constraints in the\nareas of food, housing, health and education. That is why\nthe Conference on Population and Development to be held\nin Cairo in 1994 has such importance.\nIt is not surprising that social problems are becoming\nincreasingly important at a time when many economies are\nfacing difficult adjustment processes and others are carrying\nout a delicate transition from a planned economy to a market\neconomy. Moreover, all recently published reports confirm\nthat there is a disturbing increase in the gap between the\nrichest sectors and the poorest sectors of populations, both\nwithin countries and between countries.\nThe World Summit for Social Development which will\ntake place in 1995 will, if it is adequately prepared, offer the\ninternational community an opportunity to develop a strategy\nto combat poverty and to ensure the better distribution of\nwealth.\nMore than a year ago the Secretary-General issued his\nreport \\\"An Agenda for Peace\\\", which was designed to\nstrengthen the Organization\u2019s capacities in the area of\npreventive diplomacy and the maintenance and restoration of\npeace. Some of the proposals it contains are already being\napplied in practice, but others are still pending. We hope\nthat the current review of the Agenda will lead to specific\nresults that can meet the Organization\u2019s needs.\nReform of the Security Council is a delicate issue\nwhich touches on the very heart of international post-war\ncooperation. The Council has now been in operation for\n50 years, and the time has come to have a candid and in-\ndepth discussion of the question. The fiftieth anniversary of\nthe Organization in 1995 could offer us a good opportunity\nto do this.\nThe second crisis facing the United Nations - and this\npoint has been emphasized in all the statements made here\nso far - is the chronic budget deficit. To put it bluntly, the\nUnited Nations is bordering on insolvency. This is all the\nmore astonishing in that the annual budget of the\nOrganization is about the same as that of a medium-sized\ncity.\nThe legal obligation that binds all Member States\nmakes it incumbent on them to pay their financial\ncontributions in full and at the proper time. The credibility\nand the operational capacity of the United Nations depend on\nthis.\nIn conclusion, let me turn to an old Europe.\nIn building European union the members of the\nEuropean Community have tried to seize an unprecedented\nopportunity for the entire continent to achieve a truly unified\nEurope, a Europe of countries that have often made war\nagainst each other in the past.\nWithout denying the current difficulties, I believe that\nthe process of integration being carried out by the European\nCommunity can serve as the inspiration for initiatives for\nregional integration in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nEuropean unification was thought up and implemented\non the basis of principles that are still fully valid:\nreconciliation between peoples that only yesterday were\n34 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nenemies; broad-ranging political, economic, commercial and\ncultural cooperation; and the development of a social model\nbased on pluralistic democracy, the market economy and\nsolidarity. Such a model guarantees justice and social\ncohesion even if we are never able to make it perfect and it\nmust be constantly adjusted.\nIt is on the basis of these common values that all the\npeoples of Europe can, for the first time in their history,\nbuild their future together. I believe that at the world level\nalso, thanks to concerted international action, we will be in\na better position to overcome the obstacles to peace and to\ncreate a world order that is more democratic, more tolerant,\nmore just and more social - in a word, more in keeping with\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I should like to congratulate the\nPresident on his assumption of his important post at the\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\nI should also like to express my gratitude for making it\npossible for me to comply with the instructions of the\nPresident of Turkmenistan, Mr. Niyazov, and the entire\nTurkmen population in speaking to the world community.\nA unique situation prevails in the world today. There are no\nlonger two inimical camps, and we virtually have eliminated\nthe most pressing problem of global nuclear conflict.\nFurthermore, ridding ourselves of the ideological yoke has\nfreed us from internal conflicts and contradictions. As\npolitical scientists said after the end of the standoff between\nthe two blocs, we now have on the world agenda urgent\nproblems - new and bloody regional and internal conflicts,\nwhich are no less dangerous to the world than a global\nconfrontation.\nWhat are the reasons for this seemingly unfathomable\noutbreak of aggressiveness and conflict? In our view, the\nanswer to this question can be found in the lack of political\npragmatism and in a failure to understand realities. One of\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 25\nthe major reasons is the lack of a deep-seated political\nculture and of restraint, and the desire to do everything at\nonce. But there are no miracles. We need political courage,\nwhich has been demonstrated by the President of\nTurkmenistan, in order to avoid the pitfalls of unrealistic\ndecisions, something which might, to put it mildly, lead to\nsocial disappointment.\nFrom the very first days of our independent existence,\nTurkmenistan found itself faced with a whole series of\ndifficult and unique problems, which were determined by the\nspecial characteristics of its attaining statehood. Proclaiming\nits sovereignty and independence is only the starting-point\nfor a lengthy process which is to lead to the establishment\nof an efficient political system, a strong national economy\nand a workable social structure. For this, we need\nessentially not just reforms but a full reorientation of the\npolitical system and of the economy. I should like to\nemphasize especially this aspect, since at the same time very\ndifficult reforms will be needed in other areas as well.\nThe natural economic and social development of our\npeople was interrupted for seven long decades. As a result,\npeople lost the notion of private property, and their ways of\nthinking and social morals became out of touch. This is an\nimportant aspect, and we should bear this mind in\nestablishing new States on a new legal basis.\nAt the present time, the most important possessions of\nall the citizens of Turkmenistan are independence and the\nopportunity to solve their problems independently. Perhaps\nthis would seem to be axiomatic, but as we see it, of the\nentire system of priorities formulated by the Government of\nour country, this is the most desirable in the current\ncircumstances prevailing in Turkmenistan and in the area.\nIn order to achieve large-scale reforms of the political\nand economic system in Turkmenistan, a programme of \\\"10\nyears of stability\\\" has been adopted. What are the tasks of\nthat programme? First and foremost, to wean the economy\naway from the notion of State property, in particular from a\nfoodstuff-dominated economy and production towards the\nproduction of prepared products. The second is the\nformation of the political, economic, social, spiritual and\ncultural life of the State, without the infamous system -\ninherited from the past - of roles played out in advance.\nThirdly is the formation and development of democratic\ninstitutions, including a multi-party system. Against the\nbackground of these processes, we see social psychology\ntransformed, away from political apathy and the lack of\nresponsibility.\nIn this regard, we are trying to pursue our policy in\nsuch a way that we would strengthen our ability to avoid\nsocial upheaval, breakdowns in all sectors of society and the\nlack of social harmony. This is not easy. The people of\nTurkmenistan need unity and solidarity. This gives us hope\nfor the future, however. Pragmatism will be a determinant\nin overcoming our difficulties in establishing the major\ncriteria for Turkmenistan\u2019s current foreign policy. In solving\nthese economic problems, we are offering to our foreign\npartners businesslike cooperation without any ideological or\npolitical passions, and we have found understanding\neverywhere. The logical outcome of this development has\nled us to the formulation of a foreign-policy concept of\npositive neutrality, which is in keeping with the national\ninterests of our State and in the interest of maintaining peace\nand stability in the region.\nIn solving military problems, we have been guided by\nour neutral status, which stems from the principle of non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of States and the\nrecognition of territorial integrity and the inviolability of\ntheir borders. It is well known that sometimes the concept\nof non-interference can be questionable or even rejected.\nBut in our view, a new independent State in Europe and\nAsia also needs conditions for the peaceful resolution of its\ninternal problems in order to achieve civil calm and in order\nto find the necessary compromises. Obviously, based on\nmilitary force, we cannot achieve development and progress\nin the broad sense of the word. And we need to move away\nfrom internationalizing the internal problems of various\nStates through military force. At the same time, we support\nthe peace-keeping actions of the United Nations and other\ninternational organizations.\nThese are the factors that determine our view of events\nin Tajikistan. I can state that our position has found support\nand understanding among other countries. We have reached\nagreement with the leadership of Iran on a new agreement,\none of the most important conditions of which is the\ntransformation of the 1,500-kilometre border between Iran\nand Turkmenistan into a border of peace and cooperation.\nWe are actively engaged in political dialogue with the\ncentral Government of Afghanistan and also with the\nauthorities of the northern and north-western provinces.\nSuch a policy has brought positive results. Recently we\nsigned a three-party memorandum on the construction of a\nrailroad from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan.\nIn addition, Afghanistan will see the first major railroad in\nits history. We will make it possible, therefore, to have an\noutlet to the ports of the Indian Ocean through the States of\nCentral Asia and Europe.\n26 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nSpeaking of relations with our neighbours, we must\nespecially emphasize the role of Russia in the creation of an\nindependent Turkmenistan. We well understand that this\nprocess began in Russia and was initiated by its leadership.\nA high degree of understanding at the level of leadership\nand the traditional mutual respect of our peoples has\nestablished a lasting basis for the development of mutually\nadvantageous bilateral cooperation on new and equitable\nbases. In speaking of this, I should like from this rostrum\nto state that Turkmenistan supports the efforts of the\nleadership of Russia to establish order and to establish\nconditions for the active continuation of political reforms and\nthe full dismantling of the totalitarian system and its\nreplacement with a system chosen by the people.\nTurkmenistan is actively developing relations with\nTurkey, Austria, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Pakistan,\nMalaysia, Germany, France, Argentina and Italy, and\nconstructive dialogue with the United States is under way.\nPresident Niyazov\u2019s recent visit to Belgium laid the\ngroundwork for new cooperation between Turkmenistan and\nthe countries of the European Community and between\nTurkmenistan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nWe are also opening a number of Turkmenistan Embassies\nabroad. In short, our country is actively involved in\ninternational relations.\nWe support those agreements that will lead to an end\nof confrontation and make possible peaceful and constructive\ndialogue. Among those agreements, we note with\nsatisfaction the recent changes in the relationship between\nIsrael and the PLO.\nTurkmenistan\u2019s geopolitical situation - our country is a\nmember of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (CSCE) and is at the same time connected by deep\nhistorical and cultural roots to the Middle and Far East -\nenables us, in view of our country\u2019s stability, to play a\nconstructive role in bridging the gap between two major\nregions of the world.\nI should like to say a few words on Turkmenistan\u2019s\nposition vis-\u00e0-vis the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nTurkmenistan is in favour of the Commonwealth, in favour\nof the development of integrationist processes and, while it\nopposed the establishment of any kind of rigid centralized\nsystem in the past it is in favour of coordinating structures.\nIn our view, the coming forth today of super-national\nformations has held back the process of independence and\nhas now led back to the former system of decision by force.\nIn States that have arisen since the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion, we now see respect for national interests alone, and\nwe see only the bare beginnings of a process of inter-State\nrelations on new, qualitatively different bases. The\nstatehood of these countries is a difficult matter, and this\nprocess must respect national specificities and social and\neconomic factors. If all these factors are borne in mind, any\nkind of rigid coordinating structure is impossible. Attempts\nartificially to impose positions and a unified model for\ndevelopment on new independent States cannot but work\nagainst sovereignty and national interests. In the final\nanalysis, such an approach would lead to the establishment\nof a new centre.\nFrom the very outset, Turkmenistan actively attempted\nto develop relations with the countries of the Commonwealth\nof Independent States on the basis of bilateral relations and\nvarious types of agreements, in view of the fact that the\nCommonwealth is primarily a consultative mechanism that\ngives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and experience\nand to lay down programmes of action. We feel that such\nan approach is more flexible and therefore more effective.\nExperience has shown that at this current stage - and I\nemphasize, at this current stage - bilateral agreements are a\nmore reliable basis for solving problems as they arise.\nWe often see the example of the European Community,\nand, supposedly, the same thing could happen in our region.\nTo my mind, anyone who tries to achieve what the European\nCommunity has done over 40 years is not taking into\naccount some essential factors: the high-level starting-point\nof the unification of Europe, the very different market basis\nof its economies and what might be called the European\npsychology. We have none of these factors.\nIt is important to establish the fact that if we cannot\ncount on our future relations, the Commonwealth of\nIndependent of States has no prospects. We in Turkmenistan\nbelieve, and have always believed, that a solution should be\nfound within the framework of the Commonwealth, should\nbe adopted by consensus and should be very broad and\nbased primarily on economic feasibility and attractiveness.\nThis will be only the first step, and it needs to be followed\nby others on a higher level of integration.\nBut for this, the Commonwealth of Independent States\nand the countries of which it is composed need a period of\ntransition in order to work out acceptable approaches and\nadequately evaluate the existing realities. Over two years of\nindependent development, we have done a great deal of\nwork in establishing a legal basis for the market. We have\nalready established the basis and guarantees that opened up\nthe Turkmen market to foreign investors and enterprises. In\nForty-eighth session - 5 October l993 27\nTurkmenistan we have introduced private property,\nincluding land, and we have established zones of free\neconomic development. Today we have a stable political\nsituation and social agreement. It is important that society\nbe psychologically prepared for new economic relations.\nOn 1 November this year, Turkmenistan will introduce\nits own national monetary unit, the manat. We are in an\nextremely unstable monetary zone, which would mean\ncertain limitations for Turkmenistan if we gave up our\nsovereignty and formed our own policy regarding prices,\ntaxation, budgeting, credit and monetary policy. Hence, our\ncountry has sometimes absorbed some losses because of\ncontinuing inflation and the economic crisis.\nAll of this was conditioned by the need to introduce our\nown currency. We believe that our own currency policy will\nbe closely linked to that of the United States dollar, and we\nintend to ensure, from the time we introduce it, its\nconvertibility. According to prognoses of international\nexperts and our own evaluations, we have a real opportunity\nof doing this. The manat will be a reliable currency for the\nState reserves. The introduction of a national currency\npolicy will hasten structural changes in the economy and\nbring us closer to the market.\nWith the International Monetary Fund we have worked\nup a programme of structural economic changes, including\na step-by-step process. From 1 October we have begun a\nbroad liberalization of prices, including plans to enter the\nworld price system and this also includes energy prices.\nWith the introduction of the manat as our currency we are\nbeginning active privatization, which involves, first and\nforemost, the sphere of services in the area of medium-sized\nand large enterprises. This is to be done by selling\nenterprises at auction and distributing shares among workers.\nWe hope to conclude the privatization process by the end of\n1995.\nI should like to point out that the privatization\nprogramme has been carried out in close cooperation with\nthe World Bank. In addition, measures to free prices have\nbeen undertaken by the Government in order to free up\ntrade. Licensing of exports will take place with a view to\nobserving norms ensured through national security and the\nprotection of our cultural and artistic heritage. We shall also\nundertake other steps designed to promote maximum\nstimulation of international trade and eliminate administrative\nbarriers and to increase access to the market. In a time of\ntransition to a market economy, we intend to make the\nState\u2019s role more streamlined and open and significantly\nreduce its interference in economic activities.\nWe welcome the attention the United Nations\nspecialized agencies have paid us with regard to our\nproblems. Despite our difficulties and the problems yet to\nbe solved, the Republic has achieved considerable success.\nOver the first six months of 1993, Turkmenistan\u2019s national\nincome increased by 112 per cent. Such growth would not\nhave been achieved by many States in a similar situation.\nOver that same period industrial output increased by 116.9\nper cent, and agricultural production increased by\n124 per cent.\nThe stronger our economy, the more reliable the fabric\nof political and social life in our State. At the same time,\nwe believe that economic development is inconceivable\nwithout our country\u2019s steady development of a society in\nwhich the individual and his interests are regarded as the\nmost important end. For Turkmenistan, which for 70 years\nhad a totalitarian system with backward social development,\ndevelopment of the economy remains the keystone of our\nState policy. In this context, along with other forthcoming\nmajor international events, such as the International\nConference on Population and Development, the Fourth\nWorld Conference on Women, with the three objectives,\nequality, development and peace, and the International\nConference on Population and Development, which will deal\nwith problems of human beings and their need for shelter,\nwe welcome the preparations for the World Summit for\nSocial Development, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995,\nwhich will deal, we think, in detail with social consequences\nof economic reform and restructuring as applied to countries\nin transition. In the context of social problems, I should like\nto point out that in 1990 we had the World Summit for\nChildren, which established a new basis for improving living\nconditions for children the world over.\nThe Government of Turkmenistan gives priority\nattention to these endeavours. Turkmenistan joined in the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and intends very soon\nto sign the Declaration that was adopted at that World\nSummit. We also have serious work under way for national\nprogrammes of action in order to achieve the goals outlined\nin the Declaration.\n28 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session\nWe share the view of the international community that\nwe must rebuild the Earth\u2019s ecology. We support\ninternational cooperation in United Nations efforts in this\ntimely endeavour. In our view, it is sustainable development\nand balanced attention to the interests of all countries that\nwill ensure the successful solution of global, regional and\nsubregional problems; this should accord with the\nconclusions of the 1992 United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development and of the Convention on\nclimate change.\nI announce before the Assembly that Turkmenistan\nintends to eliminate all its nuclear weapons and will continue\nits support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), for the chemical weapons\nConvention, and for the bacteriological (biological) weapons\nConvention.\nI convey the gratitude of the President of Turkmenistan,\nof our Government and of our people to the United Nations\nfor its support and its understanding.\nI should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\nfor his tireless and innovative work.\nTurkmenistan wishes to state without reserve that it will\nhonestly and openly cooperate with all States that share its\nattachment to the principles of the Organization. Our\npolicies will be based on common sense and on protecting\nour people\u2019s interests. Turkmenistan, in creating a\ndemocratic, secular State, is open to peaceful cooperation\nand ready to engage in broadly-based, mutually beneficial\ncooperation.\n"

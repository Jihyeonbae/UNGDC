        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour for\nme to deliver this statement on behalf of Mr. Surakiart\nSathirathai, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand.\nAllow me to join all previous speakers in expressing\nour deepest sympathies to the families and friends of\nthose who lost their lives or suffered from the tragic\nincidents of 11 September 2001. The people and\nGovernment of Thailand share the feelings of sorrow\nand outrage caused by those acts of terrorism. Our\ncondolences go to the people and Government of the\nUnited States.\nI wish to extend my congratulations to the\nPresident on his election to the presidency for the fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly and express my\nfull confidence that, under his guidance, we shall be\nable to build upon the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration and accomplish our goals of bringing\npeace, prosperity and well-being to this world.\nI also wish to express our warmest\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan on\nhis being conferred the Nobel Peace Prize, together\nwith the United Nations, as well as on his re-election as\nSecretary-General. This prestigious recognition has\nbeen made because of the tireless efforts of the\nSecretary-General himself and of the dedicated United\nNations staff. The achievement of the Secretary-\nGeneral is noted in his Millennium Report, which\nencapsulates the United Nations activities ahead,\noutlines the framework for the tasks and focuses on\npeople as the centre of development, both at the\ninternational and national levels.\nAfter the events of 11 September 2001, the shared\ndestiny of the world will depend greatly on how we\nmanage to cope with these emerging new realities and\ngrowing complexities. No country is truly safe from\nterrorism and no one is capable of fighting it alone.\nNow is the time for every nation to contribute and\nparticipate in the joint efforts to combat terrorism.\nIn Thailand, we resolutely condemn all forms of\nterrorism and are fully supportive of all the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts to combat this grave\nthreat to global peace and security. Thailand supports\nall actions against terrorism in the framework of the\nUnited Nations and in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations and international law.\nWe have extended cooperation to the international\n37\n\ncommunity through existing laws, such as those on\nmutual assistance in criminal matters in the form of\ninformation exchange and intelligence sharing. The\nThai Government is amending existing domestic\nlegislation and regulations to enable the country to be\nparty to relevant international conventions, especially\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism.\nAt the regional level, Thailand has participated\nactively in the recent regional gatherings at the highest\nlevel, where international terrorism received a high\npriority, namely the recent Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting in\nShanghai. We joined other APEC leaders in expressing\ngrave concern over the threat to world peace and the\nstability of the world economy caused by terrorism and\nin reaffirming a renewed sense of urgency to restore\nconfidence to the global economy.\nAt the 7th Summit of the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 5 November 2001 in\nBrunei Darussalam, ASEAN leaders issued a\ndeclaration outlining specific measures to further\nstrengthen cooperation to deal with the threat of\nterrorism in the region. Measures proposed include the\nenhancement of intelligence exchange and the\ndeepening of cooperation among law enforcement\nagencies. ASEAN leaders also stressed the need to\nstrengthen cooperation with ASEAN Dialogue Partners\nand within the framework of the ASEAN Regional\nForum and affirmed that the United Nations should\nplay a major role in this regard.\nMy country, Thailand, supports a ministerial-level\ninternational conference on international terrorism,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, to be held at\nthe earliest opportunity. This should facilitate the\ndiscussion of problems and cooperation on\nantiterrorism, leading to possible concrete measures at\nthe global level. Terrorism should not be identified\nwith any ethnic group, faith, or nationality. Otherwise,\nour efforts could result in greater danger for our\npeoples.\nInternational terrorism has also exacerbated the\nslowdown in the global economy. This carries with it\nsignificant social ramifications as well. Airlines,\ntourism and related industries worldwide have felt the\nimpact of international tension. Countries already\nstruggling to recover from the recent economic\nslowdown are preparing to safeguard their economies\nfrom sliding further into sluggishness. Confronted with\nthe ever widening gap between developed and\ndeveloping countries, the United Nations and Member\nStates must work together to arrest and reverse this\ntrend.\nThe efforts to bridge the gap must not be confined\nto the United Nations framework alone. The World\nTrade Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar, which was\njust concluded, was a timely opportunity in which\nnations proved that they could work together and\nachieve substantial progress in pushing forward the\nglobal trade agenda for the common good of the world.\nSince assuming office early this year, the present\nThai Government has been pursuing a new approach to\neconomic and social policy. The Thai Government has\nintroduced a series of economic and social schemes\naimed at promoting the capacity-building of the people\nat the grass-roots level. For instance, it has established\nthe People\u2019s Bank and microcredit schemes for both the\nrural and the urban poor. This is to assist each\ncommunity by financing small, local projects so as to\ndevelop and market a community\u2019s own products based\non local know-how. In addition, more than 2 million\nsmall-scale Thai farmers will benefit from the\nGovernment\u2019s debt suspension scheme and a\nnationwide health insurance scheme.\nOn the issue of Afghanistan, the United Nations\nand the international community, in collaboration with\nthe Afghans themselves, must move quickly to\nformulate modalities that would help restore order and\nstability. We should also render all possible assistance\nto Afghanistan, starting with assistance of a\nhumanitarian nature at this crucial time and assistance\naimed at capacity-building in the near future. Thailand,\nfor its part, will provide a fairly large amount of rice \u2014\napproximately 3,000 metric tons \u2014 as food relief for\nthe Afghans. The Thai Red Cross has also donated\n10,000 blankets.\nWithin our own region of South-East Asia,\nThailand has reinvigorated bilateral relations with our\nimmediate neighbours and has cooperated closely in\npursuing a common vision of opening borders. We\nhave also decided to establish joint production bases\nand transportation linkages. These initiatives carry on\nthe momentum begun last year when the Economic and\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)\nadopted a resolution proposed by Thailand on the\n\u201cDecade of Greater Mekong Subregion Development\n38\n\nCooperation, 2000-2009\u201d. This subregion has been\nplaced at the forefront of the Asia-Pacific development\nagenda. In addition, Thailand also has a role in keeping\npeace in the region. We take special pride in the fact\nthat two Thai Generals have successively served as\nForce Commanders of the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET), the\nsuccessor operation to the International Force in East\nTimor (INTERFET). This is part and parcel of\nThailand\u2019s commitment to shouldering its fair share of\ninternational responsibility, particularly in South-East\nAsia.\nWe envisage the United Nations playing a major\nrole in strengthening the foundation for a future world\nthat will be peaceful, tolerant, and sustainable for our\npeoples and future generations. Therefore, Thailand is\nfully supportive of the United Nations Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations and participated actively\nin the recently concluded World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance held in Durban, South Africa.\nAs we celebrate the fifty-sixth anniversary of the\nUnited Nations, and as we congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Organization, we must ask ourselves:\nwhat do we expect of the United Nations? I believe we\nexpect it to work even harder towards cultivating a\nculture of peace, as well as improving the pace of\ninternational social and economic development. In\nthese endeavours, we believe that rich and poor nations\nalike must contribute in their varied capacities. These\nnational efforts must go hand in hand with those of the\nUnited Nations.\nLet us focus on the immediate priorities of\nmaintaining peace and harmony in the world. Let us\npledge to work together with even greater vigour for\nthe political, economic, social, and physical well-being\nof our peoples. These are, and should be, the enduring\npriorities for the United Nations and for all humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs I begin my statement in the general debate, allow\nme to express to you, Mr. Han Seung-soo, Minister for\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, the pleasure\nof my delegation at seeing you preside over the work\nof this session of the General Assembly. Your personal\nand professional qualities, with which we are familiar,\nwill ensure the success of our work. Your election is\nalso recognition of the sisterly Republic of Korea, a\ncountry with which we have close links of cooperation\nand friendship. You can be sure of the steadfast and\ndetermined support of the delegation of Paraguay as\nyou carry out your duties.\nLikewise, I would like to take this opportunity to\nrecognize the work being done by the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, who was\nrecently honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for his\ndedication to the cause of the United Nations, which is\npeace itself. We are certain that under his leadership,\nthe efforts of the United Nations will reach all peoples\nand the Organization will adapt itself to the new reality\nand important challenges imposed on us by the context\nof international politics.\nAllow me today, two months after the tragic and\ncondemnable events of 11 September, to reiterate the\nsolidarity of my Government and of the people of the\nRepublic of Paraguay with the Government and people\nof the United States and state our unswerving\ncommitment to the fight against terrorism in all its\nmanifestations. The Republic of Paraguay is not neutral\nin the face of such a cowardly crime, and it will\ncontinue to support all the efforts of this Organization\nand the international community to put a definitive end\nto these crimes against humanity. We must not confine\nourselves exclusively to demonstrations of solidarity\n6\n\nand condemnation. We must make definite\ncommitments to the international consensus that has\nbeen built in order to face this grave threat to humanity.\nThis general debate is taking place in\ncircumstances that would have been unimaginable to us\nand that have reminded us of our vulnerability to\nindividuals and groups of individuals that commit\nindiscriminate violent acts that are totally unjustified in\nthe minds or feelings of civilized human beings. We\nmust also recall that the theme of international\nterrorism has been on our Organization\u2019s agenda since\nthe twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly,\nand since then to date we have not been sufficiently\ndiligent in taking the legal and collective security\nmeasures necessary to prevent events such as those we\nare belatedly regretting\nThe urgent fight against terrorism in all its\nmanifestations, which should not be interpreted as a\nclash of civilizations or of religious beliefs, is the top\npriority on our international agenda, and we cannot\nassert that any country is free of the danger posed by\ninternational terrorism. Rarely in history have there\nbeen such grave challenges to international peace and\nsecurity like the one we face today \u2014 a fact which\nforces us take clear and firm positions that are in\nkeeping with the provisions of the Charter and the\nprevailing norms of international law. Not only is\ninternational security at stake today, but so is the\ndemocratic system itself, which represents victory and\nuniversal good in its constant aspiration to and struggle\nfor freedom and justice.\nImmediately after these events, my Government\nstrengthened internal measures required by the\ncircumstances so as to be able to exercise greater\ncontrol and security over movements into and out of\nthe country, while respecting the principle of the free\nmovement of persons.\nMindful of its responsibility and consistent with\nthe commitment made as a Member of this\nOrganization, the Republic of Paraguay, by a decree of\nthe executive branch of 24 October 2001, established\nan inter-ministerial commission to implement\nresolution 1373 (2001), recently adopted by the\nSecurity Council. The Republic\u2019s judicial and\nlegislative branches and the Attorney General\u2019s office\nwere called on to designate various governmental\ndivision representatives. The commission was installed\non 6 November 2001, under the coordination of the\nMinistry for Foreign Relations.\nA draft law is also currently under consideration\nby the judicial branch, which defines and sets penalties\nfor the crime of terrorism, and it enjoys the full support\nof the executive branch.\nOn 12 October 2001, Paraguay signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which is being referred to the\nNational Congress for adoption. The national\nGovernment has embarked on constitutional procedures\nso that the other conventions on this matter to which it\nis still not a party will be signed and ratified or adhered\nto as soon as possible.\nWe also expect the early adoption by the General\nAssembly of the two conventions on terrorism, which\nare under discussion in the Ad Hoc Committee created\nfor this purpose in the Sixth Committee. We must not\nwait for a replay of the events of 11 September in order\nto accelerate our strengthening of the international\nlegal framework. The time we delay in strengthening\nour legal framework will be an opportunity for the\nterrorists to increase their capacity and expand their\ncriminal activities to other countries.\nWithin the framework of the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS), we have participated with full\nconviction in deciding on actions and formulating\ndecisions that were recently adopted during the\nconsultative meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.\nIn the context of our regional association \u2014 the\nCommon Market Southern Cone (MERCOSUR) \u2014 on\n28 September 2001, it was decided to undertake the\nbroadest possible cooperation among its members in\norder to carry out information exchange, studies,\nconcerted actions against terrorist acts and the\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to\nappraise and devise common policies in the fight\nagainst terrorism.\nIn recent weeks we have experienced once again\na new terrorist threat, and I am referring particularly to\nthe use of biological agents, whose effects could reach\na planetary level and threaten humanity itself as a\nwhole. This new criminal practice compels us to react\nas rapidly and energetically as possible and be\ndetermined in all our efforts to uncover the perpetrators\nand their sponsors, who are acting in anonymity.\n7\n\nInternational concern and actions generated by\nthe events of September must also prompt us to reflect\nand evaluate other themes of transcendental importance\non our agenda, such as the fight against poverty, the\nneed to strengthen international economic cooperation\nfor development, access to markets and information\nand communication technologies by the developing\ncountries so that the imbalances that still characterize\ninternational relations may become less severe.\nAchieving the goals set in the Millennium\nDeclaration, along with other commitments entered\ninto in the context of development in the various\nforums of our Organization, must continue to be one of\nour greatest and urgent challenges in coming years.\nFor this reason, we fully concur with the point\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report on the\nwork of the Organization that the most difficult battle\nfacing the international community is the eradication of\npoverty \u2014 which is exactly why we must speed up the\neconomic growth of the developing countries. We trust\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held next year in Monterrey,\nMexico, will achieve the desired results. To this end,\nwe believe that consideration must be given to the\nclear-cut differences among existing levels of\ndevelopment, to the unevenness that prevails in the\ncapacity of countries to participate in international\nprocesses and, in this regard, to the special situation of\nlandlocked countries, which, because of the nature of\ntheir territory, face greater difficulties in engaging in\nexternal trade, thus putting a brake on their economic\ndevelopment.\nIt is our hope that the final outcome of that\nConference will not be confined solely and exclusively\nto a mere political declaration or expression of wishes.\nWe hope that it will set clear objectives and goals to\nensure that the globalization process, rather than\nwidening the existing gap between rich and poor, will\npromote the development of all nations within an\ninclusive and equitable framework.\nGiven the new challenges and changes that have\narisen since the beginning of the new millennium, we\nreaffirm our commitment to the urgent need to\nstrengthen our Organization, underscoring first and\nforemost the central role that should be played by the\nGeneral Assembly as the most representative, universal\nand equitable deliberative organ. We should not allow\nthe General Assembly to become a mere meeting place\nwhere we participate in order to fulfil a routine\nfunction within a pre-established timetable of work.\nSpeeding up reform of the Security Council is\nanother of the key aspects in strengthening the United\nNations. The Council should become a more\ndemocratic, representative and transparent organ so\nthat it can strike a better political balance. This process\nshould provide for an increase in both permanent and\nnon-permanent members, so as to secure a better level\nof participation for developing countries which, at the\npresent time, are under-represented. Likewise we\nbelieve that, in the area of transparency of the\nCouncil\u2019s activities, it is appropriate to establish\ninteractive machinery involving the other Member\nStates of the Organization so that they will have greater\naccess to the Council\u2019s work. For this reason, we have\nwelcomed the briefing meetings that the Chairman of\nthe Special Committee established pursuant to Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) is giving to other\nMembers of the Organization.\nAnother outstanding issue that needs to be\nresolved by our Organization, and one that gives us\nutmost concern in view of the recent increase in\nviolence and loss of life, is the situation in the Middle\nEast. We believe that both the General Assembly and\nthe Security Council should redouble their efforts to\narrive at a solution that will respond to the rightful\naspirations of the parties concerned. It should include\nrecognition of Israel\u2019s existence within secure and\nwell-defined borders and the Palestinian people\u2019s full\nenjoyment of the right to have its own homeland. We\nneed to tackle this issue firmly and resolutely, ensuring\nthat we work together with the necessary political will\nto contribute to international peace and security.\nMy country, Paraguay, also hopes that other areas\nof tension in the world may be settled. In this regard,\nmindful of the principle of universality enshrined in\nour Charter, we advocate a solution to the question of\nthe Republic of China and Taiwan within the\nframework of the norms of international law.\nThe current economic and social state of affairs,\nand its consequences, obliges us to mobilize efficiently,\nwith the greatest possible degree of responsibility and\nsolidarity, the cooperation required from the developed\ncountries and the international financial institutions to\ntackle the challenges that we, as leaders, face when we\ntry to create conditions of equal opportunity for paid\nemployment, and when we seek to eliminate income\n8\n\ninequities that undermine social stability, and to\nprovide for basic care and services for our peoples and\nfor the sustainable development of our countries.\nIn conclusion, we are aware today, more than\never, of the need to begin a process that allows us to\nwork together in a rational way to build a more\nsupportive and participatory new economic world\norder, the ultimate purpose of which would be to\npromote development and well-being for all of our\npeoples, once and for all. In this regard, I wish to\nexpress my Government\u2019s utter conviction that the\ncurrent international situation underscores the\nimportance of this process beginning and ending within\nthe sphere of the United Nations, thus ensuring full\nparticipation in it of all Member States.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wanted to come here,\nand I had to come here. I thought it was necessary to\nshow that I will not allow those fanatic killers, who\n4\n\nmay be secretly lurking right now, to prevent me from\npresenting the general views of my country, the\nRepublic of Croatia, about the current situation in the\nworld in front of this audience in the United Nations.\nThis year, the general debate is taking place later\nthan usual. The terrorist attacks on New York and\nWashington postponed the scheduled autumn session. I\nemphasize the word \u201cpostponed\u201d. The terrorists did not\nmanage to paralyse the United States of America. They\ndid not manage to stop the work of the United Nations;\nnor will the world\u2019s statesmen cancel their visits to\nNew York and their participation in the work of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nSince 11 September, when as if in a nightmare we\nwere faced with the horror of global terrorism, it has\nbeen repeatedly said by many people, including myself,\nthat the world is no longer the same. I am here today to\nrepeat this, and also to add a few more words. It is true,\nor at least it seems to be true, that the terrorist attacks,\nwhich left thousands of deaths behind, have changed\neverything. However, the truth is slightly different:\nmuch has changed as a result of the attacks, but\nnothing has changed in the area that made it possible\nfor the attacks to be committed.\nI would therefore like to stress the following\npoints. In order to make sure that the terror experienced\nby New York and Washington will not happen again,\nwe \u2014 I repeat, we \u2014 have to change the world\ncompletely.\nToday we live with the threat of global terrorism,\nand the global response to it. With regard to the nature\nof this first big war of the twenty-first century, I can\nonly repeat what I recently mentioned in my speech in\nthe Israeli parliament, the Knesset. This is not a clash\nof civilizations; this is not a clash of cultures; this is\nnot a conflict of religions. This is just a confrontation\nof civilization and non-civilization.\nI would also like to be very clear about something\nelse. There is no such thing as \u201cour\u201d or \u201ctheir\u201d\nterrorism. There is no justified or unjustified terrorism.\nIt is in the nature of terrorism, regardless of whether it\nis masked by an ideology, religion or war of liberation,\nto kill innocent people \u2014 the more, the better.\nTerrorism is therefore absolutely unacceptable, and this\nis why we are fighting against it today.\nWe have created a broad anti-terrorist coalition,\nan alliance of countries not previously known in\nhistory, which can only be compared to the anti-fascist\ncoalition at the time of the Second World War. This\nanti-terrorist coalition is almost an alliance of the\ncivilized world, a defence response of that world to the\nchallenge and threat of destruction and anarchy. I\nwould like to stress two things with respect to the\nresponse and the circumstances in which it is taking\nplace.\nFirst, today we are not faced with the dilemma of\nchoosing between anarchy imposed upon us by the\nterrorists, on the one hand, and autocracy, which some\ncould perhaps see as the only efficient response to\nglobal terrorism on the other. To accept that dilemma\nwould be fatal for our civilization. The response is, and\ncan only be, democracy and the rule of law. The\ndefence of democracy must not turn it into its very\nopposite, even under the conditions of war imposed\nupon us by the terrorists.\nSecondly, the establishment of the anti-terrorist\ncoalition represents the beginning of profound and far-\nreaching changes on the world political scene. I am\nspeaking about changes in relations between countries\nor groups of countries. I am also speaking about\nchanges in the nature and way of functioning of\ninternational alliances, such as the North Atlantic\nTreaty Organization, as well as existing international\norganizations like the United Nations and those\norganizations that are just emerging, of which the\nInternational Criminal Court is one example.\nHowever, while we are still combating global\nterrorism using our military, political and economic\nforce and intelligence organizations, we must start\nlooking for answers to the following questions: What is\nglobal terrorism and what makes it possible? It is not\nenough to defeat the terrorists we are faced with today.\nWe have to do everything we can to make sure that we\nshall not be dealing with new terrorists tomorrow. This\nis the second level of change that needs to be carried\nout, but that is not yet being made. I view the situation\nas follows.\nIt will not be difficult to encourage fanatic\nbehaviour in both individuals and large groups of\npeople \u2014 thus turning them into ruthless killers or\nterrorists \u2014 as long as famine, poverty and non-\ndevelopment are present in large parts of the world,\nand as long as people anywhere suffer from inequality\nand the absence of freedom as a result of unresolved\nregional crises. I therefore think that we have to change\n5\n\nthe world completely, if we do not want our present\nfight against global terrorism and our victory over it, of\nwhich I have no doubt, to be mere episodes.\nThat might sound too ambitious or even a bit\nutopian, but I believe it is neither of the two. I am sure\nthat, in addition to the fight against terrorism, there is\nanother task ahead of us that is no less difficult or\nresponsible, namely, creating and implementing a\nglobal strategy for solving accumulated problems of\ntoday\u2019s world, problems that did not appear only\nyesterday. Many of them have been discussed under the\ndome of the General Assembly. Many beautiful words\nhave been said. It is now time to turn those words into\nactions. It is now time for those actions to stop ugly,\nabominable words full of hatred and hostility from\nturning into new acts of madness such as the ones we\nsaw in this city. We have a common interest: life in\npeace and safety for all. Let us have a common goal,\ntoo: a life of dignity for all. Neither can be achieved\ntomorrow everywhere, but both can be achieved\neverywhere.\nI would like this session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly to reaffirm this world Organization\nas an irreplaceable instrument in the struggle for a\ndifferent and better world. I would like this session to\nshow the political will of all Member States to start\nseeking together \u2014 and finding \u2014 in a sincere and\ncoordinated way, solutions to problems that, in the\ncontext of the threat of global terrorism, prove to be\nliterally unavoidable.\nLet us not forget that in September the terrorists\nused planes full of passengers in order to kill thousands\nof people. The next time they may use chemical,\nbiological or, perhaps, even nuclear weapons to kill\nhundreds of thousands of people. Let us also not forget\nthat this Organization was founded to \u201csave succeeding\ngenerations from the scourge of war\u201d. There is no time\nto lose. Let us change the world we live in so as to be\nable to continue to live.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeff\nI would like to begin by congratulating the President\non his outstanding election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. His election reflects\nthe recognition by the international community of the\nplace and the role that the Republic of Korea, a great\nfriend of Gabon, plays in the world and particularly in\nAsia. I would like to assure him of our full cooperation\nduring his period of office.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\nI express the satisfaction of my delegation for the\nexcellent work done in the course of the last session.\nAnd to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\nwould like to reaffirm the highest appreciation of the\nGovernment and the head of State of Gabon, His\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, for the dedication\nand determination with which he has endeavoured to\nmake a reality of the ideals of peace, justice and\nwelfare contained in the United Nations Charter. The\nNobel Peace Prize, which has just been awarded to him\nas well as to the United Nations, is eloquent testimony\nto the work being done by the United Nations system to\npromote peace and build a more prosperous world. He\ncan rest assured of Gabon\u2019s support for his efforts in\nthe service of the United Nations.\nIt is little more than a year ago that the heads of\nState and Government of the Member States of the\nUnited Nations met here in New York at the historic\nMillennium Summit. On that occasion, they laid down\nthe guidelines for the future work of the international\ncommunity and reaffirmed their commitment to the\npurposes and principles set forth in the Charter of our\nOrganization. The Millennium Summit thus enabled\nour nations to renew their commitment to act in unity\nand solidarity in order to take up the numerous\nchallenges facing the world.\nThe tragedy which took place on 11 September\n2001 in the United States of America has, more than\never, strengthened our determination to combat\ninternational terrorism. We must put an end to it by all\npossible means \u2014 military, diplomatic and political. It\nis for this reason that Gabon unreservedly supports\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\n(2001) as well as the adoption of a comprehensive\nconvention on terrorism.\nThere is no possible doubt that the coalition\nwhich has been created will be victorious in the fight\nagainst terrorism. In this surge of solidarity, the\ninternational community must, in parallel, find\nappropriate responses to the world problems that can\nserve as a pretext for certain radical groups. There is an\nurgent need to act to find solutions to the conflicts and\neconomic and social problems of our time.\n31\n\nAs far as armed conflicts are concerned, we are\nconvinced that if illicit trafficking in small arms and\nlight weapons could be ended, it would be easier to\narrive at a prompt and lasting settlement. The\nimplementation by everyone of the recommendations\nof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held\nhere in New York last July, would enable us to reach\nthat goal.\nFaithful to the commitment of President Omar\nBongo, Gabon remains committed to and involved in\nefforts to restore peace in the world, particularly in\nAfrica. Here, I would like to express our satisfaction at\nthe return of peace to Congo (Brazzaville) following a\nnational dialogue involving all parties, under the\nauspices of the international mediator. The stability\nwhich has been restored to this brother country has\nmade possible the voluntary return of the numerous\nCongolese refugees from my country to their homes\nsince August, thanks to excellent cooperation between\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, the Gabonese\nauthorities and the Congolese authorities. Similarly, we\nwelcome the significant progress that has been made in\nthe Burundi peace process, which on 1 November 2001\nculminated in the establishment of a transitional\ngovernment.\nI would like to pay deserved tribute to former\nPresident Nelson Mandela for the dedication and\ndetermination with which he conducted the process to\nthat important stage. For his part, the President of the\nGabonese Republic will, at the request of the members\nof the Burundi Peace Initiative, pursue his efforts with\na view to consolidating the peace process in that\ncountry.\nConcerning the situation in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, we welcome the important\nefforts already undertaken in establishing the United\nNations peacekeeping mission. We earnestly hope that\nthe Johannesburg phase will make possible the start of\nan effective inter-Congolese dialogue.\nThe situation in the Middle East, because of the\nthreat it presents to international peace and security, is\nalso a source of deep concern. I therefore urge the\nparties to resume negotiations, the only way to arrive at\na lasting peace.\nAt the very moment when the process of\nglobalization of financial markets and trade is affecting\nevery aspect of the life of our societies, one must\nrecognize that an ever-growing number of the world\u2019s\npeoples risk being marginalized if concrete measures\nare not taken on their behalf. The international\ncommunity therefore needs to mobilize new and\nadditional resources to enable them to narrow\nconsiderably the gap separating them from others. The\nforthcoming International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, scheduled for March 2002 at Monterrey,\nMexico, accordingly arouses great hopes. If this\nimportant conference is well prepared, it will help us to\nsatisfy these legitimate expectations.\nLeaders have understood that Africa holds the\nkey to its own development. The creation of the\nAfrican Union and the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment are part of this logic. Much remains to be\ndone for development to blossom, but the foundations\nhave already been laid. To achieve full success,\nhowever, Africa needs the assistance of the United\nNations and the international community.\nAnother question vital to our planet\u2019s future at the\nbeginning of the third millennium is that of the\nprotection and preservation of the environment. The\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, which is\nto be held in Johannesburg from 2 to 11 September\n2002, will provide us a further opportunity to evaluate\nthe progress made in implementing policies reflecting\nthe commitments we undertook in Rio de Janeiro 10\nyears ago. What conclusions will we be able to draw as\nto the implementation of Agenda 21? What chance of\nsuccess will we be prepared to give the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\nKyoto Protocol, the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification in Those Countries\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\nand the Convention on Biodiversity? In other words,\nwhat we must do is to respond more simply and\ndirectly to the issue of the choices and concessions we\nare prepared to make to be able to pass on to future\ngenerations a preserved environment that is similar to\nthe heritage we ourselves received from our fathers.\nAny efforts made by the countries of Africa to\nensure better economic growth will be in vain if no\nlarge-scale effort is mounted against such diseases as\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and, not to be\nforgotten, arterial hypertension, which is another of the\nmain causes of death in Africa. There is therefore an\nurgent need to implement the United Nations\nrecommendations on AIDS, particularly with regard to\ncare, support and treatment. There is also an urgent\n32\n\nneed to make operational the special Trust Fund\ncreated for that purpose.\nAt a time when the United Nations, and in\nparticular the Security Council \u2014 the body primarily\nresponsible for the maintenance of peace in the\nworld \u2014 is increasingly called upon to take on the\nnumerous challenges posed by the third millennium,\nthe matter of reforming that body continues to be\nhighly relevant. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how a\ncontinent like Africa can be without permanent\nrepresentation on the Council.\nThe reality of today\u2019s world, divided between\nuniversalism and particular interests and identities,\nclearly illustrates that humanity is still searching for\nharmony and unity. That is why we are firmly\nconvinced that a solution to the concerns I have just\nmentioned is to be found in the international\ncommunity\u2019s promotion of the virtues of dialogue and\nsolidarity, which are the pillars of the new humanism.\nWithout respect for those values, the dream cherished\nby the founders of our Organization to build a peaceful\nand united world will remain a chimera. Working\ntowards establishing a new humanity free from\nselfishness, hatred, passions and injustice must\nconstitute our common concern."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn taking the floor here at the\nHeadquarters of our Organization \u2014 recipient of the\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 meeting in New York,\nwhich has been so tragically attacked, I wish naturally,\nat the outset, to renew to the delegation of the United\nStates and the great country it represents, our friend,\nand the American people the expression of heartfelt\nsympathy of the Principality of Monaco. Confronted\nwith insane actions that prompt horror and indignation,\nwe find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal, as\nwell as in the task that now faces the international\ncommunity of making decisions and working so that\nour States and societies will be spared other appalling\nviolent acts in the future.\nI would like once again to extend to you, Mr.\nPresident, and to all the members of the Bureau our\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. I\nam confident that, under your great leadership, our\nwork will be carried out in a way that will best meet\nthe expectations of the international community. I also\nwish to assure you of the spirit of cooperation of the\ndelegation of Monaco.\nI also wish to hail the brilliant re-election of the\nSecretary-General, a clear sign of the confidence that\nwe have in his intelligence and humanity, which are\nlinked to his profound knowledge of the circumstances\nin which he must discharge his noble mission regarding\nworld affairs, of which our Organization is seized. We\nalso wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that the\nPrincipality of Monaco, my country, shares at the\n11\n\nrenewal of his mandate and of our full support, which\nwe will continue to offer him.\nWe are very gratified that the 2001 Nobel Peace\nPrize was awarded to him jointly with our\nOrganization, a fully deserved and justified reward that\nshould motivate us \u2014 the States Members of the\nUnited Nations \u2014 to work together even more with\nhim to champion peace and to fight the many seeds of\nconflict that threaten our world, terrorism, human\nrights violations, underdevelopment and pandemics\nsuch as AIDS.\nThe tragic circumstances in which this session of\nthe General Assembly is taking place make it our duty\nto contribute with even greater determination than in\nthe past to the struggle against terrorism. Owing to\ntheir enormity and to the defiance that is behind them,\nits manifestations can, as we have seen, pose a grave\nthreat to international peace and security. The\nPrincipality of Monaco firmly supports everything the\nOrganization has adopted and implemented to stifle\nthis scourge, which can be so devastating to the\nprinciples we all hold. The fact that what a lawyer\nwould call \u201cedged weapons\u201d were enough to bring\ndown one of the most modern and sophisticated\nsymbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragility\nof our societies, which densely populated urban centres\nand interdependence in all vital areas make even more\nvulnerable in the light of the boundless contempt of\nsome for human life and human dignity.\nAmong the most important of the commitments\nour States have undertaken on behalf of their peoples\nby signing the Charter of the United Nations are the\nobligations to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, to develop friendly relations among nations\nand to encourage respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms: commitments that a handful of\nterrorists, in their blind facelessness, rejected with\nappalling arrogance and savage brutality.\nTwo months to the day have elapsed since that\ntragic event. Although emotions have by no means\nsubsided, the healing effects of time are beginning to\ngive us a little of the sense of distance that is so\nnecessary for more objective consideration of this\nastonishing political challenge and this unacceptable\nhuman tragedy.\nThe General Assembly very quickly undertook\nsuch consideration through its debate in early October\non measures to eliminate international terrorism. For\nits part, the Security Council had already correctly\nmarked out the initial path and the principal guidelines.\nAnd the Secretary-General has repeatedly called on\nMember States to remain more united than ever, and it\nappears that his words have been heeded.\nAlthough the nature of terrorism did not change\non 11 September, its scale did. The General Assembly\ndecided to respond with a complete cohesiveness that\nhas been rare in its history. By adopting its resolution\n1373 (2001), the Security Council did not shrink from\ndrawing on the full scope and range of its powers under\nChapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existence\nof a threat to peace and an act of aggression and thus\ndecided on the exceptional measures that the\nPrincipality of Monaco is proud to be implementing.\nFor us, following up on these initiatives with the\nnecessary effectiveness means not only implementing\nthe resolutions that reflect our common determination\nand our commitment to fight terrorism and formulating\nadditional agreements and conventions, but also, first\nand foremost, bringing our expertise to the\nimplementation of instruments that have already been\nconcluded and to which we have acceded or intend to\naccede. Improving the Organization\u2019s action in the\nlegal sphere is both indispensable and of top priority;\nwe know this, as does the Government of the\nPrincipality. Therefore, yesterday I signed and\ndeposited, on behalf of my father, the sovereign Prince,\nthe instruments of ratification of the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism. The Principality of Monaco considers it\nessential that there be coordinated worldwide action\nagainst all forms of financing of terrorism, in order to\ndeprive extremist movements of the resources that\nenable them to do such serious harm to the\ninternational community and to its deep-seated\naspirations to peace and security. Afghanistan, much of\nwhose territory is occupied and a portion of whose\npeople are today enslaved, is the most telling example\nof this.\nThe visionary Millennium Declaration and the\noutcomes of recent world conferences \u2014 such as the\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the\nDurban World Conference Against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related\nIntolerance \u2014 also merit special attention. Without\nquestion, these latter can contribute greatly to\nimproving, respectively, international security and\n12\n\nunderstanding among peoples. On the fight against\nracism, the subject of the Durban World Conference, I\nwould note that the Government of the Principality of\nMonaco has decided to recognize the competence of\nthe Committee on the Elimination of Racial\nDiscrimination, established under the International\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\nDiscrimination, to receive and process communications\nfrom individuals or groups of persons charging\nviolations of a right set out in that instrument, to which\nMonaco is a party.\nInternational economic and financial cooperation,\nwith its inevitable human and social consequences,\nmust also be included in the reflection prompted by\nthese events, which is more necessary than ever in the\nlight of the issues facing us today. Because it is in\npart the result of the new interdependence, the\nglobalization of trade in products, manufactured goods\nand services \u2014 disparaged by some and hailed by\nothers \u2014 must also be a part of our urgent intellectual\nand practical endeavours, so that beyond the\nconstraints and imperatives that guide it, human beings\ncan regain their just, legitimate role. Above all, the\neconomy must serve today\u2019s men and women, with\nrespect for their legitimate aspirations, their vital needs\nand the age-old richness of their diversity.\nRegional and subregional cooperation is\nparticularly conducive to such a goal. My country is\nconvinced of that; in the Mediterranean area we are\nengaged in the trade, culture and technological spheres,\nand are working to promote sustainable development\nand environmental protection. Nor should we neglect\nactivities which by their nature tend to bring together\nmen and women from different backgrounds, such as\nartistic and cultural events, academic meetings and\nsporting competitions. In the Assembly\u2019s debate on the\nagenda item entitled \u201cBuilding a peaceful and better\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal\u201d, the\ndelegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable role\nin that connection of physical education and sport, as\nwell as of the Olympic games.\nAnother way to bring human communities\ntogether is the multilingualism for which the United\nNations must be a model. That key item is on the\nAssembly\u2019s agenda this year. The Principality of\nMonaco will state its views on that subject and will\nstress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages of\nmultilingualism for genuine understanding and mutual\nrespect among peoples.\nAlongside modern science and technology, which\nare moving forward and rapidly becoming universal,\nthus fostering exchanges among peoples, more\ntraditional forms of communication also have an\nimportant role to play. In our view, teaching and\ninformation, more than ever before, have a\nfundamental role in spreading ideas of peace and\nunderstanding among men and women in our troubled\ntimes. Here, the General Conference of the United\nNations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\nOrganization has given us excellent regulatory texts,\nworking documents and programmes that we must\nrevitalize with increased energy in order to provide\ngreater hope to young people, who are often frustrated\nby the harshness of daily life.\nWe also, and very often, give thought to the seas\nand the oceans, which made such a contribution in\nancient times to meetings of civilizations and to the\nspread of knowledge, thus enriching art and culture\nwhile developing trade and solidarity. A few days from\nnow, the delegation of Monaco will state its views\nduring the consideration of the agenda item on oceans\nand the law of the sea. My country has always been\ndevoted to better scientific knowledge and careful\nprotection of the marine environment, an indispensable\nsource for the harmonious flourishing of life.\nThus the Principality of Monaco, with other\nMember States, requests the Assembly to grant\nobserver status to the International Hydrographic\nOrganization, for which it is the headquarters, in order\nto allow that institution to strengthen its cooperation\nwith Governments and to advance international\ninitiatives and exchanges in marine cartography \u2014\ninitiatives and exchanges designed to spread\nknowledge of seabeds and coastal zones, as well as to\nmake navigation easier and safer.\nRespect for the decisions and resolutions taken by\nour forums and the strengthening of our regulatory\nactions, as well as the implementation of the\ndeclarations and plans of action of our recent global\nconferences, are significant commitments to which the\nauthorities of the Government of the Principality of\nMonaco are dedicated. In our difficult times, they\nrepresent shared values which prompt us to act together\nin the interest of our international community, which is\nalso in the interest of each of our countries.\nTo close on an optimistic note, allow me to\nexpress the hope \u2014 a hope that I believe is shared by\n13\n\nmany here \u2014 that the wisdom of nations united more\nthan ever before will be able to triumph rapidly over\nthe evil represented by terrorism in its new global and\nuniversal form, while extirpating from the world the\nstubborn roots that fuel it.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.\nHan Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the\nAssembly and to express our thanks to his predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri.\n\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and the United Nations on their\nwell-deserved Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWe are compelled to take up the events of 11\nSeptember and the actions initiated by our\nOrganization, starting with Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), at our discussions here today. I have\nchosen to make my statement in a language not of my\ncountry \u2014 English, the language of our host country\nand city \u2014 in tribute to the United States, to the\nAmerican people and Government and to New York\nCity, which were harmed by the recent terrorist attacks.\n\nWe meet today almost two months after the\nterrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York\nCity. The horror of this attack, the thousands dead: so\nmany terrible images have been seared into our\ncollective memory. And we remember also the\nremarkable acts of courage and determination that\nfollowed in the wake of this shameful crime.\nThat the attack took place here, in New York, the\nseat of the United Nations, is both painful and sad. For\nNew York is an immigrant\u2019s city that welcomes with\nopen arms all races and all creeds from our world. The\nlist of the victims of the attack, from so many different\ncountries, attests to the remarkable and joyous\ndiversity that makes New York. She is truly the capital\nof the world, and the right place, the only place, for its\nUnited Nations.\n29\n\nWe know that this very building might have been\na target for the terrorists, and that in an earlier terrorist\nattack of 1993, the United Nations was on the list. This\nseems to me proof, if any is needed, that the United\nStates of America is not the only object of terrorism.\nRather, it is the idea of tolerance and religious and\ncultural diversity, symbolized both by New York City\nand by the United Nations, that is the object of the rage\nof a small group of men \u2014 men who live and die by\nterror and who have turned away from political debate\nto violence and death.\nAnd so all of us here must play our part in the\nbattle against mindless killing, and debate both the\nreasons for and the responses to terrorism. If there are\ndisagreements and disputes, we should never forget\nthat the very act of debate \u2014 the very idea of this\nforum \u2014 is anathema to those whose modus operandi\nis silence. What is telling, in my opinion, is not the\nidentity of the perpetrator \u2014 we are quite certain who\nis responsible, although we have only begun to\nconsider why \u2014 but the fact that the perpetrators, dead\nand alive, never admitted responsibility for their\nactions.\nI would thus like to express the views of my\ncountry, the Principality of Andorra, in this debate.\nAndorra is a small country created in 1278 by a pact of\npeace, and is blessed with seven centuries of peace and\na parliamentary system that started in 1419. We\nAndorrans like to think of our country as an example of\ntolerance and coexistence of different creeds and\nnationalities. Through the centuries, we have welcomed\nscores of refugees from European wars persecuted in\ntheir homelands for their ideas. Our Constitution,\nwhich enshrines the secularity of the State, includes a\nfar-reaching bill of rights that highlights democracy\nand the rule of law. Let me therefore reaffirm, as our\nPresident, Marc Forn\u00e9, stated immediately after the\nattacks, Andorra\u2019s condemnation of these crimes.\nMy country has taken appropriate measures to\ncombat terrorism in all its forms, and I will be signing\nthe United Nations Convention for the Suppression of\nthe Financing of Terrorism, the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\nthe Conventions of the Council of Europe against\nterrorism and corruption.\nLet me assert Andorra\u2019s belief in the role of\ndebate rather than violence as a necessary response to\nviolence \u2014 its belief that the United Nations is a vital\nforum for world conversation, a forum whose\nprinciples, and indeed whose buildings, need to be\ncelebrated and protected.\nLet us therefore ask ourselves what it is these\nterrorists want. In the videotape he released the day the\nAmerican bombing began, their leader announced the\nfollowing goals: first, the removal of American troops\nfrom Saudi Arabia; secondly, an end to the bombing of\nIraq; and, finally, a resolution of the Palestinian\nproblem.\nIt is worthwhile to note that both the presence of\nAmerican troops in Saudi Arabia and the bombing of\nIraq are the direct result of prior aggression. The\ninternational community has for decades sought a\nresolution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, but a\nsolution, if one is to be found, must come first and\nforemost from within Israel and Palestine. Their peace,\nif it is to be reached, cannot be imposed from without.\nWhile these are the proclaimed reasons for the\nhostility of the terrorist networks to the United States,\none might come to the conclusion that these stated\nobjectives are a screen, and that the attacks were made\nin order to bring about religious wars in the twenty-\nfirst century.\nFor the United States and its allies, it is a war\nagainst terrorism. But the terrorist networks claim it is\na religious war, pitting Christianity against Islam. The\nold rhetoric of the Crusades, such as the loss of\nAl-Andalus \u2014 Andalusia \u2014 in 1492 and other battles\nfrom history are being invoked by the terrorists to\ninflame the feelings of Muslims throughout the world\nand to bring about a fundamentalist pan-Islamic entity.\nThis is a delicate issue but we must face it head-on.\nThis crisis can be contained only if we speak bluntly\nand rationally.\nThe terrorist networks invoke history \u2014 the\nhistory of religious war \u2014 to inflame sentiment. Their\ninvocation of history, however, may be a tactical error.\nFor history can be our ally in the battle against\nterrorism and violence.\nI beg your pardon, but let us return to an earlier\npoint in history, a bloody time of religious crisis in\nEurope \u2014 and I am speaking about the wars of religion\nthat decimated sixteenth and seventeenth century\nEurope. Out of these wars of religion and out of the\n30\n\nbloody struggles of the Reformation came a powerful\nantidote to religious violence that we call humanism.\nThe great French humanist Michel de Montaigne was a\nsceptic. He wrote about the limits to human knowledge\nin his remarkable Essays. In one of them, entitled \u201cOf\nPractice,\u201d he observed that, although we can practice\nfor many things in life, there is one thing for which we\ncannot practice, one thing we cannot know, and that is\nour own death. He went on to describe the closest he\ncame to knowing death, an accident that happened\nwhen he fell from his horse. He had been out riding in\na militia and was nearly crushed to death. He had a\nbrief sensation of his soul hovering over his body, and,\nlater, after being taken home, terrible pain continued to\nplague him.\nAt a time of religious extremism, when Catholics\nand Protestants were fighting over the keys to\nheaven \u2014 just as the 11 September terrorists died\nbelieving they would enter paradise \u2014 Montaigne\nwrote about the limits of knowledge. And he wrote\nabout a personal experience, this accident, with which\neverybody, even now, can empathize. This is why he is\ncalled a humanist, because of his genuine interest in\nhuman experience.\nThere is no revealed truth in Montaigne, no\ndogmatism, only human scepticism that appears as an\nantidote \u2014 the only antidote \u2014 to the certainty of\nmadmen who would kill for belief. This evolution in\nhuman thought was accomplished without sacrificing\nthe freedom to believe, to have faith in God and to\npractice a religion. To think and write as Montaigne\ndid \u2014 that is, to insist on the limits of knowledge, and\nto speak not in a universal but in a personal voice \u2014\nwas a great step forward for humankind. In turning\nknowledge away from religious certainty, the\nhumanists allowed for a new field of understanding\nthat we now call the sciences.\nWhile inquisitions would carry on for a\ncentury \u2014 Galileo was a boy when Montaigne was\nwriting \u2014 the scepticism that Montaigne advanced\nagainst religious violence in 1580 is the same as that\nwhich Boyle, Newton, or Lavoisier would apply to the\nuniversal truths of natural theology in order to create a\nway of understanding that we now recognize as\nscientific. Modern scientific understanding ushered in\nthe industrial revolutions, the astonishing explosion of\nthe middle class, of print culture and of the\nestablishment of modern democracies. It introduced all\nof these \u201cworld-historical\u201d events, to use Hegel\u2019s term\nthat we call, rather sloppily, \u201cmodernity.\u201d\nI conclude my intervention on the subject of\nmodernity, because many commentators on the current\nwar in Afghanistan see the war framed as a war\nbetween the Taliban, as Islamic extremists, and\nmodernity. They cite the way in which the Taliban have\nbanned all forms of mass media culture and have\ninsisted on a literal application of sharia law. They\nargue that the Taliban are anti-modern and that their\nregime is trying to return its people to an earlier, pre-\nmodern way of life. Yet, when we examine the lives of\nthe 11 September terrorists, we realize first that they\nwere not Afghans, and second, that they were not the\nwretched of the earth. They were from the middle\nclass. Most were students, some with advanced\ndegrees. They never even had to work hard for a living,\nlike most members of the middle class. These men\nwere privileged murderers. Or let me put it another\nway: they were fully modern.\nThe struggle between modernity and the anti-\nmodern is not anachronistic. To be a terrorist demands\nthat you enter, systematically and rationally, into the\nmodern world and to turn its apparatus, such as\ntransportation and communication, against it. The\nstruggle against modernity is one of the most romantic\nmyths generated by modernity itself. So, too, is the\nmisrepresentation of the poor by certain writers and\nintellectuals \u2014 I need not name names \u2014 who claim to\nspeak for them. The suffering sown in Afghanistan by\ndecades of invasion and civil war, they argue, has\nbrought terrorism as its terrible harvest. In fact, these\npoor want most of all to live, and to live well. They\nembrace modernity and its comforts. But violence, the\nability to treat other people as objects, as things to be\ncrushed and destroyed: this is a gift bestowed by\neducation.\nThe struggle is therefore ideological. This is why\neducation, the greatest gift, was a passport to terrorism\nfor these men. The risk of education in this context is\nthat the pressure of knowledge, or more precisely a\nrecognition of uncertainties and of the limits of\nknowledge, will tempt the student into dogmatic belief.\nThe danger always exists that education can harden\nfrom humanistic scepticism into the rock of dogma.\nWhat is to be done? Today I propose an urgent\nreturn to a new humanism on two fronts: first, within\nIslam, a humanism among Muslims \u2014 politicians,\n31\n\nwriters, readers \u2014 that can dampen sectarian violence\nand that can reach out to religious extremism to find\ncommon ground. This can only come from within the\nIslamic world. It does not have to be secular in nature,\nalthough secularism has an important yet increasingly\nthreatened status within certain nations.\nCorrespondingly, there must be recognition within\npolitical regimes everywhere that antipathy to political\ndissent politicizes religion and creates more problems\nfor these regimes than it solves. Modernity\u2019s belief in\ndemocracy as a means to popular expression has never\nproved more vital.\nSecondly, outside of Islam, a return to humanism\nlies at the heart of the modernity in which we are\nliving. To recognize modernity and its great\ncontribution, a secular and universal culture \u2014 mass\nculture \u2014 is something that needs to be protected and\nfought for. It is a modernity that insists on the rights of\nmen, women and children.\nWe all know that words often do not lead to\naction. But we forget that words, the expression of\nideas and of criticism, are a vital form of action. We\ncannot be simplistic in our desire for a direct\nrelationship between debate and resolution.\nWhat I am proposing is certainly not propaganda;\nrather, it is a worldwide debate on the importance of\ndebate, in which human scepticism, a recognition of\nthe limits of belief, is very much at stake. Whether this\nargument can be made in an urgent and anti-elitist way\nis very much the point. But unless we are able to\nrecognize modernity as a liberating experience,\nindependent of its accumulation of goods and services,\ncreature comforts, and the like, I have little hope for a\npositive resolution to the crisis we now face.\nModernity is a work in process. One name for\nmodernity, as it exists for us today, is globalization.\nThis is the creation of a \u201cworld culture\u201d, the entry of\ntechnology into every aspect of our lives, the\nomnipresence of the media and the increasing speed by\nwhich culture and information are communicated. It\nseems to me that there is tragic confusion between\nglobalization and abstract and oppressive technology. It\nis this notion of modernity that seems to be at the heart\nof the recent protests against globalization, protests\nthat would have been the focus of our debates before\n11 September. While the protesters have many valid\npoints to make, and they need to be listened to,\nglobalization and modernity are not the problem.\nWhether cooperation between nations is economic,\npolitical or cultural, it is not a threat. Leaders and\nintellectuals need to reach out and embrace the limits\nof knowledge. They must speak out against dogmatism\nto unravel facile notions of monolithic governments or\nglobal compacts.\nAn eye for an eye, that harsh principle from the\nOld Testament, will soon leave us blind. Blindness,\nrather than insight, is the curse of the ideologue, of\npeople who do not want to see outside their own skins,\ntheir ideas or their place. It is the curse of people who\ndo not want to see the world in its marvellous diversity,\nits uncertainty and its possibilities. To see this world,\nwe have only to look around us here, now. We have\nonly to wander through the streets of this miraculous\ncity of New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session is taking place amid feelings of sadness\nand grief that prevail following the terrorist acts of 11\nSeptember that befell the United States. They\nvictimized the thousands, from more than 80 countries,\nwho were working in the World Trade Center in the\nCity of New York when the vicious attack took place,\nand also resulted in great material and economic\ndamage.\nMy country, the State of Bahrain, moved quickly\nto condemn the terrorist attacks in New York, just a\nfew kilometres from the Headquarters of the United\nNations, and in Washington, D.C. The Emir of Bahrain,\nShaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, expressed to\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United States of\nAmerica, and to the friendly people of the United\nStates of America the deep condolences of the Emir,\nthe Government and the people of the State of Bahrain\nfor the victims of these wicked attacks, which run\ncounter to the teachings of all divine religions as well\nas the basic tenets of humanity and the standards of\ncultural values.\nThe State of Bahrain has supported the\ninternational alliance against terrorism. It has offered\nits cooperation as a participant in efforts and measures\nto eliminate terrorism and terrorists as well as their\nhavens and financial resources. We have done so out of\nour firm and principled position against terrorism and\nour rejection of all forms of violence and extremism.\nSuch violence and extremism contradict the teachings\nof true Islam and its tolerant values, as well as all lofty\ncultural and human values in which we believe and\nwhich we support.\nThe State of Bahrain also followed and\nparticipated in the debates on combating terrorism\nduring this session of the General Assembly. It shares\nthe opinion of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nthat the shocking events of 11 September have united\nthe world against terrorism, as demonstrated by the\ncondemnation of those horrific attacks expressed by\nmillions of people from all societies. We also share the\nSecretary-General\u2019s opinion that, because of its unique\nstructure, the United Nations has an important role to\nplay in mobilizing the international community in\ncountering and combating terrorism.\nAs part of its policy of cooperation with\ninternational efforts, the State of Bahrain welcomed\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which dealt\n27\n\nwith the issue of terrorism, in particular operative\nparagraph 6, which requests Member States to report to\nthe Security Council Committee within 90 days on the\nsteps taken to implement the resolution.\nWhile expressing our feelings of sadness at the\nhorror of the events of 11 September, we must also\nwarn against the danger of exploiting the events to link\nterrorism to Islam. Islam is a religion of amity and\ntolerance, and we would like to warn against the\ndanger of stirring up hostility against Muslims and of\nigniting a conflict between religions and civilizations,\ninstead of dialogue and interaction among them for the\ngood of all societies and people of different races and\nbeliefs. In this context, we are pleased to welcome the\nposition taken by the United States of America and\nother friendly countries in calling on their citizens to\nrefrain from harming their residents or citizens of Arab\nand Muslim descent and reaffirming the spirit of\ntolerance, interaction and dialogue among religions and\ncultures.\nThe United Nations, which is the ideal tool for\nconfronting international terrorism, faces other\nchallenges that stand in the way of cooperation for\nprosperity, economic and social development and the\nbuilding of a world in which justice, peace and equality\nprevail.\nIn this regard, this year the United Nations held\nseveral special sessions of the General Assembly, one\non human settlements and the other on HIV/AIDS, as\nwell as a Conference on small arms. The Economic and\nSocial Council also convened conferences on\ninformation technology, the eradication of poverty and\nfinancing for development, as well as the World\nConference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which was hosted\nby the Republic of South Africa.\nThe State of Bahrain endorsed the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration, and today \u2014 on the basis of\nits deep-rooted civilization and sustained revival aimed\nat strengthening the foundations of the modern State,\nattaining comprehensive development, further\ninvigorating the mechanisms of civil society and public\ninstitutions in order to enable its citizens to understand\ncurrent issues and the need for further advancement \u2014\nit reaffirms its determination to continue shouldering\nits national, regional and international responsibilities,\nwith a view to achieving the common purposes and\nprinciples set out in the Charter of the United Nations\nand the Millennium Declaration.\nIn this context, His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin\nIsa Al-Khalifa, Emir of the State of Bahrain, took the\ninitiative to establish a national committee that\nincludes representatives from all sectors of Bahraini\nsociety. This committee prepared a draft Charter for\nnational action, which was approved in a free\nreferendum by a majority of 98.4 per cent of the people\nof Bahrain, and was ratified by His Highness the Emir\nin February this year. This Charter is part of a\ncomprehensive plan to develop Bahraini society,\nupdate its systems and institutions and transform it into\na modern State capable of participating effectively in\nthe new world order and of facing the challenges and\nrequirements of the era.\nThis historic step was coupled with a number of\nmeasures to improve and update constitutional and\ndemocratic institutions, reaffirm the rule of law,\nachieve justice, equality and equal opportunities and\nenhance popular participation. Foremost among these\nare developments in the field of human rights, which\nhave confirmed the participation of women and\nenhanced their role in civil society, including their\nright to vote and to run for elected office, as well as the\nestablishment of the Human Rights Committee of the\nShura Council and the establishment of the Supreme\nCouncil for Women. The Council\u2019s mandate includes,\ninter alia, proposing public policies in the field of\ndevelopment and enhancing the role of women in civic\nand constitutional State institutions. Proud of its\naccomplishments in the political, economic and social\nfields and reiterating its determination to press ahead\nwith its comprehensive development plans to build a\nmodern State capable of reaffirming its international\nposition and consolidating its relations with various\ncountries of the world, the State of Bahrain would also\nlike to express its thanks and appreciation for the\nsupport given by many States of our Organization to\nthe worthy steps taken by His Highness the Emir.\nBahrain\u2019s determination to imbue its relations\nwith others with a spirit of friendship and cooperation\nis evidenced by its fraternal, amicable and close\nrelations with brotherly and friendly States. Such\nrelations are based on mutual respect, non-interference\nin the internal affairs of others and the promotion of\ngood-neighbourly relations and cooperation among\nStates. In this respect, it is worth noting the position of\nboth the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar on the\n28\n\njudgement handed down by the International Court of\nJustice on 16 March this year, which brought to an end\nthe border dispute between the two brotherly countries.\nThe statements issued by the leaders of both countries\nsaid that the judgement, which was accepted by the two\ncountries, had opened a new page in relations between\nthem, based as they are on agreement and cooperation\naimed at achieving their common interests, and that it\nrepresented the triumph of international legitimacy and\nthe principles of international law.\nIt is regrettable that the ramifications of the\ndangerous events witnessed in the Gulf region over the\npast 20 years constitute an ongoing threat to the\nsecurity and stability of the region and an obstacle to\nits development and growth. The State of Bahrain,\nwhich would like to see regional and international\nsecurity prevail, especially in the Gulf region, which\nhas strategic importance and in which various countries\nof the world have vital interests, calls once again upon\nIraq to cooperate with the United Nations and to fully\nimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions, in\nparticular those relating to weapons of mass\ndestruction and to the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of\nwar and detainees and those of other nationalities, so\nthat efforts to lift the sanctions and to end the suffering\nof its brotherly people may succeed.\nThe State of Bahrain also hopes that, in the light\nof the positive developments in relations between the\ncountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, a peaceful solution can be\nreached in the current dispute between the latter and\nthe United Arab Emirates over the three islands,\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, all of which\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. The State of\nBahrain approves of and welcomes the direct contacts\nthat have taken place between the two neighbouring\ncountries and hopes that the dispute will be settled by\npeaceful means in accordance with the principles of\ninternational law, including referral to the International\nCourt of Justice.\nSince the current Israeli Government came to\npower, the Middle East has experienced serious\ndevelopments that have brought back conditions of\nhostility and confrontation such as engulfed the region\nprior to the beginning of the Madrid peace process in\n1991. This has come about through Israel\u2019s aggression\nagainst the Palestinian people and its oppression,\neconomic isolation and blockades of all the territory\nunder Palestinian authority.\nThe peace process based on Security Council\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973), and on the Madrid terms of reference \u2014\nspecifically the principle of land for peace \u2014 is at an\nimpasse. The explosive situation in the Palestinian\nAuthority\u2019s territories, with all its inherent risks,\nincluding the threat to security and stability in the\nMiddle East and to the interests of the Authority and\nother States, requires the international community, and\nprimarily the sponsors of the peace process, to shoulder\ntheir responsibilities to put the peace process back on\ntrack so that its objectives may be achieved.\nThis can be done only through the full\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions calling\nfor a complete withdrawal from the Arab territories\noccupied by Israel in the Syrian Golan Heights up to\nthe boundaries of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining\noccupied territories of the Republic of Lebanon, and\nthrough full recognition of the legitimate rights of the\nPalestinian people, including its rights of return and to\nthe establishment of its own independent State with\nJerusalem as its capital. In this regard, we welcome the\nstatement made by President Bush of the United States\nof America on the right of the Palestinian people \u2014\nsupported by the European Union, the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council and the international\ncommunity \u2014 to establish a Palestinian State.\nThe role of the United Nations and the reform of\nits machinery to enable it to face its challenges and\novercome them collectively are among the priorities of\nthe Charter that were reinforced by the Millennium\nDeclaration. The Declaration calls on us to uphold the\nrule of law nationally and internationally, to respect\nhuman rights and to conduct international relations in\nsuch a way as to preserve world security, peace,\ndevelopment and stability.\nIn praising the role of the United Nations, I\nshould also like to take this opportunity to convey my\nwarm and sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan,\nwhom the Member States have unanimously re-elected\nas Secretary-General for a second term in office in\nrecognition of his tireless efforts to allow the\nOrganization to play its full role and to achieve its\nobjectives. Through those efforts, the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations under his leadership\nhave fully deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for this year\nin appreciation of their great contribution to\nmaintaining international peace and security. I\n29\n\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and the United\nNations on that honour.\nI also have the pleasure to extend to you, Sir, and\nto your friendly country, the Republic of Korea, our\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I express\nthe hope that you will succeed in carrying out your\ntasks. I also thank your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri\nof Finland, President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session, and commend his invaluable efforts\nin conducting the proceedings of that session and of the\nspecial sessions held in conjunction with it.\nWe believe firmly that the destiny of the human\nrace is a common destiny, given that we all live in one\nworld. We are therefore duty-bound to preserve that\nworld and to protect it from the threats of war,\ninternational terrorism, conflict, disease and poverty. It\nis incumbent on us, the peoples of the United Nations,\nas stated in the Charter, to choose to practice tolerance\nand to live according to the will of Almighty God as\npeoples that cooperate in the pursuit of friendship,\njustice, peace and security.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy most sincere\ncongratulations go first to His Excellency Mr. Han\nSeung-soo on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His outstanding\npersonal qualities and the consistently valuable\ncontributions of his country, the Republic of Korea, to\nUnited Nations activities are clear guarantees that the\nstewardship of the current session of the General\nAssembly, which started under dramatic and sorrowful\ncircumstances, has been entrusted to a safe pair of\nhands.\nI would also like to renew my heartfelt\ncongratulations to our Secretary-General on the well-\ndeserved awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize and on his\nelection to another term in office. Romania will\ncontinue to support his commendable endeavours\ntowards reforming the Organization in a way that\nshould enable it to cope effectively with the challenges,\nold and new, of our modern world.\nThe horrific terrorist attack of 11 September was\na rude awakening for all of us. It brought into focus\nboth the abyssal evil we have to confront and the high\nvalue of human solidarity in the international response\nto it. It also shed new light on some problems that the\ninternational community has been facing for quite a\nwhile and accelerated certain processes, the far-\nreaching consequences of which are still not easy to\npredict.\nThere can be no ambivalence or half measures\nwhen it comes to condemning and effectively\ncombating terrorism and militant, violent fanaticism of\nany kind. The tragedy that befell the United States and\nthe United Nations host city affected all humankind\nand created a new resolve to bring to justice the\nperpetrators and those who support, abet or harbour\nthem. We share the views of the President of the United\nStates, Mr. George W. Bush, that what is at stake is not\njust America\u2019s freedom but that this is the world\u2019s\nfight, civilization\u2019s fight, the fight of all who believe in\nprogress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.\nBelief in those fundamental values have inspired\nthe noble concept of the dialogue among civilizations,\nso eloquently expounded by the Secretary-General in\nhis address to the Assembly. Indeed, it is only through\ndialogue that points of convergence can be identified\nand cooperation becomes possible on matters that\nacquire significance once they become the object of\nshared concern.\nFrom the very beginning. Romania joined the\ninternational democratic community in its ongoing\ncampaign against evil-doers and their supporters for a\nsafer and freer world. The consensual view of the\nRomanian nation across the political spectrum was\nunequivocally expressed in Parliament\u2019s decision to\nmake Romania\u2019s air, maritime and land space available\nto the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization and to provide access to any other\nfacilities that our partners may require. This is tangible\nproof of our commitment to acting as a de facto\nmember of the North Atlantic Alliance.\nMy country firmly supports the relevant\nresolutions recently adopted by the General Assembly\nand the Security Council, and we have already\nundertaken the necessary steps to ensure their full\nimplementation in Romania.\nRegional solidarity is also essential. At a very\nrecent conference on the common fight against\nterrorism, held in Warsaw on 6 November, the heads of\nState of Central and Eastern Europe reflected upon\ntheir past common experiences and voiced their\ndetermination to stand firmly united in the fight against\nterror for as long as it takes. It is also appropriate to\n18\n\nhighlight here the meaningful work done by the\nBucharest-based Southeast European Cooperation\nInitiative Regional Crime Center for Combating\nTransborder Crime, involving active inputs from 11\ncountries. The Center should build upon its current\nactivities in order to enhance its contribution to the\nworldwide fight against terrorism by making good use\nof existing liaison systems, intelligence-sharing and\njoint task forces.\nI fully agreed with Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nwhen he recently said that we must not let the terrorist\nattacks distract us from the rest of the work we have to\ndo. In no way do these tragic events make the broader\nmission of the United Nations less relevant. Indeed, the\nnew focus on terrorism should not divert us from the\ncore business of the world Organization. The agenda of\nthis session is both comprehensive and substantial. We\nshare the view that a large portion of our work should\nbe devoted to seeking practical ways to implement the\nbroad agreement reached at the Millennium Summit\nalong the lines indicated in the Secretary-General\u2019s\nvisionary road map report.\nWe support the Secretary-General in his efforts to\nintegrate human rights into the whole range of United\nNations activities. We encourage closer cooperation\nbetween the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees, other United Nations\nagencies and mechanisms and regional structures that\nhave extensive expertise in this field, such as the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\nwhose chairmanship-in-office is currently held by\nRomania.\nWe regard the enhancement of the United Nations\npeacekeeping capability as a top priority. Recent\nexperience in the Balkans and elsewhere has taught us\nthat proper policing can be at least as important as the\nuse of military might in modern-day peacekeeping and\npeace-building operations. That is why Romania has\ndecided, in addition to its previous commitments in the\narea, to contribute a significant contingent of military\npolicemen to the international presence in Kosovo to\nassist the transition from conflict to stability.\nThe United Nations can become a focal point for\nconstructive interaction with regional or subregional\nstructures and specialized organizations of civil society\nin dealing with concrete problems ranging from\nconflict prevention to peace-building and post-conflict\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nProbably the greatest challenge to the\ninternational community is still how to reduce\neconomic and social disparities and to achieve\nsustainable growth and poverty reduction within and\nbetween all countries through appropriate policies and\nwell-focused institution-building. The world\u2019s leaders\nhave pledged to engage political determination,\nfinancial resources and innovative policies to reduce\nglobal poverty by half before the year 2015. This is\nmost commendable, but it may prove to be more\ndifficult to accomplish than originally envisaged.\nThe 11 September attacks have affected not only\nworld security but also the global economy, which in\nthe preceding months was already showing signs of a\nslowdown. The consequences are likely to be far-\nreaching and much more dangerous than those of the\n1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The volume of\ninternational trade, which increased by almost 13 per\ncent in the year 2000, may decline by as much as 3 per\ncent in 2001. People in developing countries in\nparticular are going to be hurt again.\nThe United Nations has an essential part to play\nin promoting further integration of the world economy\nin accordance with the principles of sustainable\ndevelopment. But let us face the reality: we live in a\nworld where the developmental gap between the centre\nand the periphery, between North and South, between\nrich and poor, is still wide and growing wider. The\nexisting mechanisms for an orderly transfer of\nresources appear to have been sadly inadequate. One\nwould expect that the recent shock, and the renewed\nsense of global solidarity that it has triggered, would\nprompt us into action to address the underlying causes\nof blind anger: misery and hopelessness. The war\nagainst terrorism can be truly successful only if it also\nbecomes a war against poverty, illiteracy, disease and\nintolerance. I trust that the collective wisdom and\ngoodwill of responsible politicians everywhere will be\nable to produce new and effective international\nmechanisms meant to combine the vision of\nsustainable, environment-friendly development with\ngood governance and the generalized observance of\nbasic human rights.\nWe see disturbing signs that the increasing\npolarization with regard to wealth creation goes hand\nin hand with a deepening knowledge divide. The\n19\n\nemerging knowledge economy has scarcely heeded the\ninjunctions of globalization. It still appears to the eyes\nof many to be self-serving and parochial. However, it is\nprecisely the link between economic development and\nthe advancement of knowledge that should give the\nlaggards a chance to catch up through a more rational\nutilization of resources, including intellectual\nresources. We hope to see a new pattern of open\nnetworking which will benefit each country \u2014\nespecially those that are less developed \u2014 as well as\nthe international system as a whole. Again, existing\ninstitutions do not seem creative or flexible enough to\naddress this challenge. The United Nations system may\nbecome the catalyst for concerted action in public-\nprivate partnerships to bring the \u201cdigital dividend\u201d into\nevery community and every home.\nThe knowledge gap is compounded by the\nubiquitous phenomenon of brain drain from the\ndeveloping to the developed world. The problem is\nalmost as old as the United Nations itself. How to\nreverse that trend, transforming it into a \u201cbrain regain\u201d,\nis another major challenge facing us all. To put it\nsimply, what we have here is a steady, not-so-hidden\nflow of subsidies from the poorer nations to the richer\nones. After all, most of an education budget comes out\nof the taxpayer\u2019s pocket. Banish the thought of\nregarding the individual as the property of the all-\npowerful State: that notion is dead and gone. But it\nmay make sense to start thinking of some sort of\nlegally binding international instruments built on a\nbroader interpretation of the concept of intellectual\nproperty to ensure a fairer distribution of the benefits\nof knowledge.\nThe European Union has recently regulated the\ntransfer of players between soccer clubs. What about a\nsimilar contractual arrangement between, say,\n\u201cPolytechnic University X Club\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft\nClub\u201d? Some experimental domestic schemes have\nworked well in linking industry to higher learning by\nresorting to market mechanisms. Why should we not\nconsider international intellectual partnerships,\nmutually beneficial for countries having advanced\ntechnologies and infrastructure and those generating\ncreative human energies?\nRomania supports the strengthening of the United\nNations through comprehensive institutional reforms\non the basis of the set of proposals now before us. As\nthe Secretary-General rightly noted, the United Nations\nshould turn from a culture of reaction to one of\nprevention, aiming at the root causes of the prevailing\nnegative phenomena. We look forward to an\nincreasingly effective General Assembly regaining its\ncentral position in the United Nations family, as called\nfor in the Millennium Declaration.\nExperience shows that enhanced regional\ncooperation can be both the engine and the result of\nglobalization. In a regional format, States can\nimplement innovative strategies for better access to\nresources and markets. Regional organizations are\npoised to become a significant factor in the global\ncommunity. Regional cooperation makes it possible to\ncapitalize on the advantages of globalization while\nreducing its risks.\nA set of policies can be successful only if it relies\nconsistently on the fundamental aspiration of ordinary\npeople to a peaceful and decent life. The current\nunprecedented level of knowledge will, I am confident,\nenable us to find the requisite resources, both in\nourselves and in society, for greater tolerance, mutual\nrespect and constructive dialogue, as opposed to the\nprimitive inclination to hatred and intolerance.\nIt is incumbent on the United Nations, the only\ninternational organization of universal vocation, to\nidentify within itself the resources for the resolution of\nproblems of global concern. The United Nations should\nkeep working tenaciously to renew its structures and\nimprove its operational performance as we advance\ninto the new millennium. Romania is ready and willing\nto add its contribution to that effort.\n\n\n\n\n"

Please accept our wishes for every success\nas you carry out your mandate. Let me also express our\nthanks to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the\nexemplary way he led the work of our last session.\nI should also like to pay tribute to His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, both on his\nresounding re-election and on the well-deserved and\njust awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the\n6\n\nUnited Nations, reflecting their major contributions to\nthe cause of peace and development.\nThis session is being held at a particularly\nimportant juncture in the history of international\nrelations, when the entire international community is\nmobilizing to confront the devastating phenomenon of\ninternational terrorism, the scope and magnitude of\nwhich were evident in the 11 September attacks on\nNew York and Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania,\nwhich took the lives of thousands of innocent people.\nAt that time, Sao Tome and Principe expressed its total\nindignation at the criminal and monstrous acts\ncommitted against the American people, as well as its\nfull solidarity with the American authorities and the\nfamilies of the victims. We share the opinion that those\nresponsible for these barbaric acts must be\napprehended and punished, and that terrorist\norganizations supporting them must be dismantled by\nall necessary means.\nWe reaffirm our full readiness to cooperate\nactively at both the regional and international levels in\nthe fight against terrorism, which is one of the major\nevils threatening world peace and security today. We\nhail all initiatives taken to contain the military action,\njustly launched against those who sow terror as well as\nthose who shelter them in their territories, so as to\navoid having innocent victims among the civilian\npopulation. We welcome the efforts of the international\ncommunity to adopt a juridical instrument to make the\nfight against terrorism more effective in the context of\na global strategy.\nNo one can doubt that this act of criminal,\nunacceptable and unjustified aggression, condemned\nthroughout the world, requires a new dynamic in the\nfight against it, particularly within the United Nations.\nWe note with satisfaction that important measures have\nbeen taken in that regard, notably by the Security\nCouncil in resolution 1373 (2001), of 28 September.\nYet the manifestation of extreme violence in these\nrecent attacks alerts us to the need to understand in a\ndifferent and comprehensive way the great problems\nfaced by mankind throughout the world, without losing\nsight of the merciless fight that must be waged against\ninternational terrorism in all its manifestations.\nDespite the considerable scientific and\ntechnological progress recorded throughout history,\nwhich has permitted high levels of development,\nstriking imbalances persist in a number of areas with\nregard to social and economic development, both\nwithin and among the countries, regions and subregions\nof the world. Witness particularly the situation\nprevailing in sub-Saharan Africa. A look at the\nstatistics of economic and social conditions in the\ncountries of that region is enough to reveal the urgent\nneed to develop a front that, acting concertedly and\ncollectively, can fight to eradicate their absolute\npoverty.\nFaced with this scenario \u2014 rich countries on the\none hand and poor countries on the other \u2014 one might\nwonder whether the political will exists to reverse this\nsituation, which is dominated by selfishness and the\ninterests of individuals, groups and States. Only thus\ncan one explain the lack of cooperation, indifference\nand, indeed, the lack of sensitivity shown by the\nindustries of developed countries in the face of real\nscourges that devastate thousands of people, making\nthe countries of the South even more vulnerable. For\nexample, I am thinking of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as\nwell as other epidemics, such as hepatitis B and\nmalaria.\nThe efforts of international organizations \u2014\nnotably the United Nations and its system, as well as\ncertain non-governmental organizations \u2014 to help\nmankind cope with this painful situation must be\nvisible.\nMoreover, beyond the economic data reflecting\nthe growth of poverty in Africa, the situation of our\ncontinent is worsened by the persistence of armed\nconflicts, particularly the crises in the Great Lakes\nregion, the Horn of Africa and Angola, to cite only a\nfew examples of the fratricidal war that afflicts us.\nAs to the situation in Angola, we reaffirm our\nurgent desire to see an end to the war in that fraternal\ncountry. We condemn the terrorist acts that have\nclaimed countless lives, particularly among the civilian\npopulation, and we call for a renewed application of\nthe terms of the Lusaka Protocol for conflict resolution.\nIn the context of conflict resolution, we welcome\nthe efforts of the international community to find a\nsolution to the East Timor question, as well as progress\nmade in the process of emancipation of the Maubere\npeople under the aegis of the United Nations. It is our\ngreat hope to see this brotherly people admitted to the\nUnited Nations as a full-fledged Member and to see a\nstrengthened Community of Portuguese-Speaking\nCountries.\n7\n\nWe note with concern the escalation of violence\nin the Middle East. In our view, it is essential that\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority resume the\nnegotiations on the peace process, the only way to find\na just and peaceful solution that takes into account both\nthe right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\nand the guarantee of security for the State of Israel.\nUnfortunately, Sao Tome and Principe is still on\nthe list of poor, least advanced or underdeveloped\ncountries, despite the efforts of its people and the\ndetermination of its leaders to place it on the track of\ndevelopment. Today, my country is unquestionably a\nplace of freedom and democracy where fundamental\nindividual human rights are respected. The recent\npresidential elections, held in July this year, which\nbrought Mr. Fradique de Menezes to the highest office\nof the State of Sao Tome, are irrefutable proof of\ndemocratic stability in our country. Nevertheless, the\nconstraints arising from the inequalities that prevail in\nthe new international economic order keep us from\nattaining a state of well-being and from creating more\ndignified living conditions for our people.\nDuring the Millennium Summit last year, the\nheads of State and Government adopted in this Hall a\nvery important text called the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration. I take pleasure in citing a\nportion of it:\n(spoke in French)\n\u201cwe have a duty therefore to all the world\u2019s\npeople, especially the most vulnerable and, in\nparticular, the children of the world, to whom the\nfuture belongs\u201d. (resolution 55/2, para. 2)\n(spoke in Portuguese; interpretation from French text\nprovided by the delegation)\nThis Declaration takes on particular importance\nin the case of our country, where the future and well-\nbeing of children seem badly compromised, bearing in\nmind the atmosphere of terror, the horrors of war and\nthe abuses of exploitation, famine and poverty. We\nmust act now to protect our children. We must fight by\nevery available means to ensure full respect for their\nfundamental rights. This is why we welcome with\nmuch satisfaction the Second World Conference\nagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children,\nscheduled for next month, and the world summit on the\nfuture of children, to be held in May 2002.\nSao Tome and Principe considers globalization to\nbe a phenomenon of interdependence, a unique\nopportunity to bring peoples together, not a political\nideal driven by the dominant economic Powers. Thus\nwe enthusiastically welcome the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development and share the certainty that this\nplan \u2014 based on our needs and the aspirations of our\npeople for the future, and designed to find practical\nsolutions to the economic and social problems\nthroughout Africa \u2014 will be favourably received by\nour partners, notably those of the G-7/G-8, for\nimplementation.\nThe environment is a fundamental issue for the\nsurvival of mankind, and it must continue to be the\nfocus of special attention by the United Nations. We\ntherefore stress the importance of the outcome of the\nrecent seventh Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nheld at Marrakesh. Every effort must be made to create\nand disseminate technology that can minimize the\nenvironmental impact of human activities and to\nmobilize the resources needed to implement the\npolicies and strategies adopted in a range of\ninternational forums.\nToday more than ever before, it is obvious that\nwe need to change the working methods of the organs\nof the United Nations so that they can better respond to\nthe demands of the day. As a universal organization,\nthe United Nations must be open to all States. Here we\nare talking about international law, the sovereign\nconduct of relations with other States, and active\nparticipation, in a spirit of solidarity, in development\nefforts through cooperation and international trade\nrelationships. That certainly applies to the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan. We believe in the right to disagree,\nespecially when disagreement is democratically\nexpressed by people. We also believe that dialogue is\nthe only way to ease tension wherever it is most acute.\nThe United Nations, which has always aimed to\nsupport the development efforts of all countries,\nespecially the poorest, must play a key role in the quest\nfor solutions to the major problems facing the world. It\nmust do so through fostering determination and\nadopting appropriate measures to create a fairer, more\nhuman world: a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My\ndelegation looks forward to working closely with him\nover the coming months in the pursuit of sustainable\nsolutions to the major global concerns and challenges\nthat continue to confront humankind and in the\npromotion of international peace, security and\nunderstanding.\nLet me also take this opportunity to express\nMalawi\u2019s deep appreciation of and thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for his\nexceptional skills, expertise and unswerving\ncommitment. We have noted with appreciation how his\ntireless efforts and tenacity have resulted in progress\non most of the items of the agenda during his\npresidency.\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate\nour Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United\nNations as a whole, for being jointly awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize for the year 2001. This demonstrates\nthe world\u2019s recognition of the great strides the\nOrganization and the Secretary-General have made in\ncarrying forward the mandate of the United Nations.\nThis achievement is a rare feat that we should be proud\nof, and it should serve to encourage all of us to do\nmore for the good of humanity.\nI would also like to reiterate the congratulations\nof the Government of Malawi to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\nappointment to the post of Secretary-General for a\nsecond term of office.\nIt is appalling and extremely unfortunate that at a\ntime when we thought we were making progress in\nhuman development, some people among us conducted\nheinous and abhorrent acts of terrorism. The terrorist\nattacks in this country on 11 September serve to remind\nus that the global village we are living in is under\nthreat from people who do not value human life and\ndemocratic values. The Government of Malawi\nbelieves that no cause or rationale can justify terrorism\nas a means of achieving individual or group goals, as\nsuch acts result in indiscriminate destruction of human\nlife and property. Clearly, it is evident that no nation\nwill be spared the far-reaching, devastating impact of\nthe attacks of 11 September.\nThe Government of Malawi unreservedly\ncondemns those acts and pledges its support and\ncooperation in the fight against such unjustifiable\ncriminal acts. It is our sincere hope that all those\nresponsible for the terrorist attacks on the United States\nof America and, indeed, elsewhere in the world, will\nspeedily be brought to justice. As we all share\nsympathy with the victims of the recent terrorist\nattacks, let us also demonstrate our unanimous resolve\nto deal with this problem in a decisive and conclusive\nmanner by ratifying or acceding to all conventions\naimed at combating terrorism. That will send a strong\nmessage to all parts of the world about our common\npurpose to remove this evil from our midst.\nIt is common knowledge that terrorist groups and\nindividuals or entities operate in sophisticated\nnetworks throughout the world. No country, therefore,\ncan decisively deal with this problem alone. It is\nimperative that we all pool our resources to resolutely\ndeal with the cancer of terrorism. Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) forms a sound and clear basis\non which our cooperation should be anchored. It is\nabundantly clear that, if this resolution can be seriously\nimplemented, it may effectively frustrate and check\nterrorist activities.\nIt will be recalled that the strategic priority of the\nMillennium Summit held last year was to find ways of\nreshaping and reorienting the focus of the United\nNations that would inspire a renewed and shared sense\nof universal mission, thereby enabling it to make a real,\nquantifiable difference in the lives of \u201cWe, the peoples\u201d\nin the new millennium.\nAnd yet, regrettably, one year after that watershed\nevent, the commitments of the Millennium Summit\nalready seem to be anything but what they are \u2014\ncommitments \u2014 and to be mere platitudes on the part\nof the developed countries. The Summit\u2019s much-\ntrumpeted visions, goals and collective social\n29\n\nobjectives already appear to have been consigned to the\nsame fate of non-fulfilment that has befallen similar,\nprevious commitments of the rich nations.\nIt is saddening that, at the height of a global\nintegration drive, a shockingly large number of\ncountries remains outside the globalization loop, while\na handful of economically powerful countries of the\nNorth controls the pace and terms of participation in\nthe global economy, not least the skewed distribution\nof its benefits. It is equally disheartening to note, in\nparticular, that the African continent is nowhere near\nattaining even half as much of the benefit that it has\nstrenuously striven for in the global economy. Now\nmore than ever, our continent is fast sliding deeper and\ndeeper into a plight of deteriorating mass poverty.\nThis situation is aggravated by mounting external\ndebt, crumbling public infrastructure, marginally\nfunctional social services, severe environmental\ndegradation, rising illiteracy and the rapid depletion of\nhuman resources and the skilled labour force as a result\nof endless armed conflicts and the devastation caused\nby epidemics, such as those of HIV/AIDS, malaria,\ntuberculosis and other transmissible infections. These\nare some of the many issues that we have discussed\ntime and again in this Assembly and other forums, and\nyet we seem to be getting nowhere.\nClearly, Africa is under the threat of imminent\nvirtual exclusion from the mainstream global\neconomy \u2014 more so if the underlying spirit, ideals,\ngoals and commitments of the Millennium Summit are\nnot faithfully upheld to ensure the concrete and\neffective integration of the developing countries into\nthe global economic framework on terms that reflect a\nshared future of promise of equality, equity, prosperity\nfor all and a just world.\nIn spite of all these apprehensions, my delegation\nis still encouraged by the wide global consensus on a\nrange of major issues of critical concern to the least\ndeveloped countries of Africa. The positive\nconclusions reached during the special session on\nHIV/AIDS and the world Conferences that took place\nthis year \u2014 the Third United Nations Conference on\nthe Least Developed Countries, the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the World\nConference against Racism and Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance \u2014 reflect a newly\nemerging global recognition that there is an urgent\nneed to begin concretely addressing the issues that will\naggressively advance the economic and social progress\nof the less developed nations. The declarations and\nprogrammes of action agreed at those Conferences\nmust be the centrepiece of any genuine international\ncrusade to reduce social and economic disparities and\ninequalities between the North and the South. Indeed,\nthe persistence of these inequalities and injustices, in\nour view, is the root cause of the political, economic\nand social turmoil currently tearing apart the African\ncountries and some parts of the world. Malawi would\nlike to reaffirm its steadfast commitment to the\ndeclarations of commitment, actions and programmes\nagreed at these Conferences.\nWhat the developing countries need is a chance\nfor a fresh start, which can come about only through a\ncomprehensive package of total debt forgiveness that\ncuts across the existing initiatives for debt relief,\nincluding the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative. We also need increased\ntechnical assistance, enhanced official development\nassistance and much greater flows of capital resources\nand foreign direct investment from developed\ncountries.\nWe would also like to insist on the genuine\ncommitment of the North to the full integration of our\neconomies into globalized markets through the removal\nof technical obstacles placed in the way of our exports.\nThe United Nations ought to play a leading role in\nbreaking down the walls of protectionism and to\nsustain the search for measures that can help the poor\nnations wriggle out of their poverty and vulnerability.\nThis is in line with the spirit of the resolutions and\ndecisions taken at last year\u2019s World Summit for Social\nDevelopment.\nI take this opportunity to pay special tribute to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the numerous\ninitiatives that he has undertaken to prevent violent\nconflicts in Africa and other troubled regions of the\nworld. The recent release to the Security Council of his\nspecial report on conflict prevention, which addresses\nin depth the many issues that arose from the Brahimi\nreport, is one practical demonstration of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s overpowering resolve to ensure that the\ninternational community addresses political disputes\nand tensions before they degenerate into all-out armed\nconfrontations and violent conflicts. These pose a\nmajor challenge and real threat to international peace\nand security.\n30\n\nIn the same vein, to effectively tame violent\nconflicts, the United Nations needs to deal decisively\nwith the problem of the illicit trade and trafficking in\nsmall arms and light weapons. Their easy availability,\ntransfer and proliferation remain at the centre of the\nintractability of violent conflicts, rising insecurity and\ninstability in some parts of Africa.\nMy delegation is most thankful for the success,\nalbeit measured, achieved during the recent United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. In spite of a\nspirited bid by others to water down the agreed global\nconsensus and programme of action, Africa takes heart\nin the holding of the Conference itself as a good\nstarting point for putting in place effective measures to\ncurb the immeasurable damage caused by these deadly\nweapons.\nMany evils such as slavery, the slave trade,\ncolonialism, apartheid, genocide, the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, poverty and starvation have afflicted the\ncontinent of Africa and its people. These evils have\nbeen entrenched to such an extent that even the\ninternational media only look forward to reporting on\nthe tragedies befalling the continent. However, despite\nthese ills, Africa deserves a special place in the\neconomic, political and social spheres of the world. It\nis in cognizance of this fact that our leaders, in their\nquest for a prosperous and dynamic Africa, resolved to\ntransform the Organization of African Unity into the\nAfrican Union.\nThe birth of the Union has ushered in the New\nAfrican Initiative, now renamed the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development, which seeks to pull Africa\nout of stagnation and put the continent on a new\nfooting for economic recovery and prosperity as well\nas for the promotion of human rights and good\ngovernance. As a developing region with very limited\nfinancial resources, we shall rely on our cooperating\npartners in order to ensure that our dream for a new\nAfrica is realized. Therefore, I wish to appeal for\nglobal support for this noble initiative being espoused\nby our leaders so that the people of the African\ncontinent may see real social, economic and political\ntransformation for the betterment of their lives.\nMalawi recently assumed the one-year rotating\nchairmanship of the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC). While SADC member States take\npride in the relative peace and stability that prevail in\nmuch of the subregion, we still have serious concerns\nabout the persistent general economic slowdown and\nthe deterioration of human development in the\nsubregion. SADC is experiencing an unfair share of\nproblems and challenges which require the\ninternational community\u2019s enhanced generous\nassistance and good will.\nIt is common knowledge that SADC is reeling\nunder the pressures of the untold devastation caused by\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is unravelling decades\nof hard-earned economic gains. The subregion\naccounts for 75 per cent of the world\u2019s total number \u2014\nthat is, 36 million \u2014 of people living with deadly\nHIV/AIDS. SADC\u2019s modest average economic growth\nrate of 3.2 per cent becomes a cause for serious\nconcern when compared with its staggering population\ngrowth rate of nearly the same level.\nApart from causing untold human suffering, the\ncontinuing civil wars in Angola and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo \u2014 two of the subregion\u2019s\npotential economic powerhouses \u2014 have hamstrung\nevery genuine endeavour by SADC to promote itself as\na prime destination for foreign capital and investment.\nTherefore, we call upon the United Nations to step up\nits efforts to bring pressure to bear on the belligerents\nin Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nso that the ongoing peace initiatives can yield the rich\nrewards of an early and decisive settlement. We also\ncall upon the international community to continue\nrendering vital support and cooperation to the peace\nfacilitator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nensure that the inter-Congolese dialogue bears fruit and\nserves to consolidate the gains achieved so far by the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation and the Lusaka\npeace process.\nSADC would also like to see much more pressure\nexerted on Jonas Savimbi in order to force UNITA to\nreturn to the 1994 Lusaka peace framework. Only the\nintensification of the United Nations sanctions against\nUNITA and the punishment of those violating the\nembargo would genuinely achieve that goal.\nThe attainment of durable peace and stability in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola and\nthe removal of tensions in the rest of the subregion\nwould put SADC on a stronger footing for economic\nrecovery and a firmer foundation for sustainable peace,\nsecurity and tangible economic growth and\ndevelopment.\n31\n\nTime and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of\nreadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\nUnited Nations membership, which would grant to that\ncountry a well-deserved opportunity for active\nengagement in international affairs. Malawi finds it\ngrossly unjust that the hard-working and peace-loving\npeople of Taiwan should suffer diplomatic isolation so\nunnecessarily. Therefore, Malawi would like to appeal\nto the entire United Nations membership to look\nbeyond narrow political considerations and face up to\nthe geopolitical and economic realities that obtain on\nboth sides of the Taiwan Straits. The diplomatic\nisolation of Taiwan remains both a curiosity and a\ncontradiction in terms. First, almost every country\ndeals with Taiwan in terms of trade and other forms of\nbilateral cooperation. Secondly, the isolation of Taiwan\nviolates its people\u2019s inalienable right to free association\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Charter.\nLastly, let me reaffirm Malawi\u2019s trust and\nconfidence in the leadership role of the United Nations\nin making our world a better place in which to live. I\nwould also like to reaffirm Malawi\u2019s unwavering\ncommitment to its obligations and responsibilities as a\nmember of the international community of nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would first\nof all like to express my outrage at the unacceptable\nconditions that terrorism has imposed on us at the fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly of our\nOrganization. New York has traditionally been a\nwelcoming and cosmopolitan city. But now, during the\nAssembly\u2019s fifty-sixth session, it and our Organization\nhave been forced to take on the appearance of a\nbesieged fortress.\nNo one knows what the terrorists have planned,\nnor who their next victims will be. We are all on the\nsame side in the face of their diabolical enterprise \u2014\non the side of this battered city; on the side of the\nAmerican people and their Government; and on the\nside of all the innocent victims brought down so\ncruelly and coldly in Pennsylvania, Washington and\nNew York on that tragic day of 11 September 2001. We\nreiterate our profound condolences and sympathy to all\nthe bereaved families and to their countries and\nGovernments. At the same time, we reaffirm our\nunreserved condemnation of terrorism. Terrorism\nviolates the principles of all religions. It blemishes all\nthe causes on whose behalf it claims to act, even the\nmost just among them. It is for that reason that it must\nbe combated by all of us without reservation.\nThe worldwide awakening aroused by the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001 must cause us all \u2014 great\nand small, rich or poor \u2014 to join in an extraordinary\neffort to fight those who have decided to sacrifice us\nwithout having ever consulted us about either their\nobjectives or war tactics. But it should also be said that\nas wholly repugnant as terrorist practices are, they\ncannot be eradicated definitively unless the fertile soil\nthat feeds the situations that serve as their pretexts is\nremoved. The strict respect for human rights and the\nrights of peoples that are so rightly enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations should today guide our\npolitical practices more than ever before. It is urgent\nfor the United Nations to take its proper place in\ninternational relations and for it to play the role\nincumbent upon it. In that regard, the reform of the\nSecurity Council is an urgent and imperative necessity.\nPoverty, injustice, exclusion and marginalization\nalways result in creating total despair, thereby causing\nextremism to flourish. And we know how easily\nextremists sacrifice their own lives and those of others.\nIt is the duty of all of us, and particularly of the most\npowerful among us, to provide the necessary support to\neradicate poverty, marginalization, exclusion and\ninjustice, and to bear that in mind at all times in the\njust, legitimate and resolute struggle against all forms\nof terrorism.\nThe current tragic events that I have just recalled\nheighten our concerns and give greater weight to the\nresponsibilities of the President of the General\nAssembly. But his personal talents and experience in\nworld affairs bolster our conviction that he will\nsuccessfully steer the ship of our Organization into port\nin these particularly difficult circumstances. For some\nyears now, his country and mine have enjoyed friendly\nand fruitful relations. He can count on the cooperation\nand support of the delegation of Benin in the execution\nof his noble mission.\nI would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who guided the United\nNations into the new millennium with great spirit. He\npresided over the Millennium Assembly with\ncompetence and discipline, and we extend to him our\ncongratulations and gratitude.\nMy congratulations go also to my brother,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his well-deserved re-election to the\npost of Secretary-General of the United Nations and on\nthe Nobel Peace Prize for 2001, awarded to him and\nthe Organization he leads with such competence and\ndedication. The United Nations has gained a great deal\nof credibility thanks in particular to the efforts of\nMr. Kofi Annan and his team in the Secretariat. Never\nhas there been a more well-deserved prize, and we take\npride in it. Indeed, it is all of Africa that is honoured.\nOn behalf of the Benin delegation and myself, I would\nlike to repeat our warm congratulations and\nencouragement.\nLet me take this opportunity to address the\ninternational community and each Member of the\nAssembly to convey the thanks of my country for their\nmassive participation at the Fourth International\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, held in\nCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. Indeed, the\nCotonou Conference saw record attendance, with 106\nStates, 20 international organizations and 51 non-\ngovernmental organizations represented, not to mention\nacademics and other researchers interested in\ndiscovering Benin\u2019s experience of democracy. Benin\nwas honoured by the effective participation of three\n20\n\nheads of State. The Secretary-General of the United\nNations and the Administrator of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme made a point of attending\npersonally in Cotonou. We welcome this gracious and\ngenerous gesture on their part, and express our\ngratitude to all bilateral and multilateral partners, those\nfrom the new or restored democracies as well as those\nfrom the older democracies who contributed to\nfinancing this Conference.\nTo judge by its title, \u201cPeace, Security, Democracy\nand Development\u201d, the Cotonou Conference was an\nimportant stage in the progress of our century towards\na consolidation and expansion of democracy. It marked\na remarkable advance by its future-oriented approach\nand the importance of the document that crowned its\nwork, entitled \u201cCotonou Declaration\u201d. This Declaration\nlays out brave and bold measures designed to build\ndemocracy and allow to it survive in peace, security\nand respect for diverse cultures. There can be no\ndemocracy unless it is adapted to the soil in which it is\nplanted, even if the values of democracy are universal.\nThe Cotonou Conference was also an opportunity\nto appreciate how genuine the march towards\ndemocracy in Africa is. All peoples want liberty, but\nthe institutional and financial capacity to establish it is\nweak in many cases, particularly in developing\ncountries. That is why my country hopes for more\nsubstantial assistance for the strengthening of the\ninstitutional capacities of our countries, because\ndemocracy can function only if the leaders and their\npeoples feel they are equal stakeholders. It is also\nessential that within the United Nations system, the\nstructure recommended by the Cotonou Conference,\nwhile following up the International Conference for\nNew or Restored Democracies, be established with a\nview to increasing coordination among the different\ninitiatives and activities undertaken or contemplated by\nthe agencies, programmes and various institutions of\nthe United Nations system.\nIndeed, the Fourth International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies strove to highlight the\nlink that exists between democracy and development.\nThe Conference clearly indicated that if democracy is a\nforce for stability, poverty is a major factor for\ndestabilization and a source of conflicts and war. The\ndecisions of the Fourth International Conference of\nNew or Restored Democracies should not be allowed to\nremain dead letters. We must organize cooperation and\nsolidarity among all the democracies of the world.\nIn the course of the Millennium Summit, which\ntook place in this very Hall from 6 to 8 September\n2000, major decisions were taken. Among them, pride\nof place belonged to those relating to questions of\ndevelopment, the elimination of poverty and the\nparticular needs of the least advanced countries. The\nMillennium Declaration provides, in paragraph 15 of\nchapter III:\n\u201cWe also undertake to address the special\nneeds of the least developed countries. In this\ncontext, we welcome the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries to\nbe held in May 2001 and will endeavour to ensure\nits success.\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 15)\nThat Conference was held in Brussels from 14 to\n20 May 2001 and produced a Programme of Action\nthat was the fruit of very arduous negotiation.\nHowever, questions remain. Will the poor countries\nsomeday know prosperity? Will they someday be able\nto satisfy their basic needs? How will they finance their\ndevelopment? Public development assistance is in\ndecline. Investment in poor countries remains weak,\nand the burden of debt is becoming heavier. What is to\nbe done?\nWith regard to the question of debt, we think\nparticularly bold solutions are required. For the\ncreditor countries, it must be recognized these\nsolutions are neither simple nor easy. Some of these\ncountries have already adopted exemplary and bold\nmeasures; others must follow suit. At stake are their\nown interests: at stake is the interest of world peace.\nThis demand represents to us the symbol of\nsolidarity and shared responsibility. That is why the\nBenin delegation recommends the urgent establishment\nof an effective and highly visible follow-up mechanism\nof the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries.\nIn the context of the search for peace and the\npromotion of international cooperation, many\ndisarmament organizations and other related bodies\nwere created to reaffirm that questions of peace and\nsecurity and questions of development were\ninterdependent and inseparable. The creation of the\nZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic\nmeets this need. Its goal is to protect the coastal States\nof the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean from the\ndangers of nuclear weapons and to create there a zone\n21\n\nof peace and strengthening of cooperation for\ndevelopment.\nSince the third ministerial meeting, held in\nBrasilia, my country had offered to host the sixth\nmeeting, scheduled for the year 2000, but because of\nthe organization of the Fourth International Conference\nof New or Restored Democracies, this meeting could\nnot take place. My country is looking forward to the\nearly meeting of this sixth meeting. That is why I\nwould like to announce here Benin\u2019s offer to organize\nthe sixth ministerial meeting of the States of the Zone\nof Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic in the\nsecond half of 2003.\nA particularly important instrument of South-\nSouth cooperation, the Zone of Peace and Cooperation\nof the South Atlantic should lay the foundations in\nCotonou for its effective and regular functioning within\nthe new context of international relations. All of you\nhere are welcome to Benin, a marketplace and meeting\nplace, a land of democracy and peace.\nIt is more urgent than ever to establish such peace\nin the Middle East by recognizing as a matter of\nurgency on the part of us all the imperative necessity of\nthe Palestinian State \u2014 side by side, of course, with\nthe State of Israel \u2014 in peace with all its neighbours\nwithin secure and recognized frontiers. This is the\nsame peace that Angola and all Africa long for.\nWe must ban all forms of the illicit traffic in\npetroleum, diamonds and weapons. These types of\nillegal traffic cause and sustain wars, and the\ntraffickers are genuine terrorists.\nFrom 31 August to 8 September 2001, the\nRepublic of South Africa hosted in Durban the World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance. That great\ninternational forum, held under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations, brought to light the desire for\nrehabilitation, justice and fulfilment of the obligations\nof memory and acknowledgement, which humanity\u2019s\nrecent history has left in the subconscious of certain\npeoples. The difficult debates on the thorny questions\nraised during the Conference reflect the extent of the\ndifficulties in this undertaking that we all fervently\ncalled for.\nA collective spirit of openness, the impressive\nabilities of the host country, the Republic of South\nAfrica, and particularly the receptiveness and ability of\nmy sister, Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, enabled us to\nreach agreement on two encouraging documents: the\nfinal Programme of Action and the final Declaration. In\nour view, these documents represent the international\ncommunity\u2019s renewed commitment to fighting and\neradicating the seeds of racism and racial\ndiscrimination. The foundation has been laid. Now,\naction must follow to make the two Durban documents\na reality of everyday life. This does not mean\nreopening old wounds; rather, we must all now attend\nto healing the wounds of the past.\nThe tragic events whose effects we are still living\nthrough obliged us to postpone the General Assembly\u2019s\nspecial session in follow-up to the World Summit for\nChildren. My country hopes that a new date can be\ndecided on during this session so that we can assess the\nsituation of children in the world 10 years after the\nWorld Summit, because much remains to be done to\nimprove the lot of children.\nAllow me to recall that Benin, having ratified on\n3 August 1990 the United Nations Convention on the\nRights of the Child, is among the first 22 States of the\nworld consenting to be legally bound by this\ninstrument. Benin has also ratified the African Charter\non the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Articles 12, 13\nand 26 of Benin\u2019s Constitution guarantee the right to\neducation and the protection of families, mothers and\nchildren. Benin\u2019s intentions in this area are also\napparent in the creation of a Ministry of the Family,\nSocial Protection and Solidarity, which will be devoted\nessentially to the implementation of a cohesive and\naggressive policy to protect the family, particularly\nchildren.\nEncouraging results have been achieved at the\nnational level, but much remains to be done. We are\ndoing admirable work in this area in partnership with\nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme and several estimable non-\ngovernmental organizations, such as Terre des\nHommes, and several other partners of good will.\nThose who know Benin can testify to this.\nThese collaborative efforts have not stopped\ncertain misinformed or ill-intentioned circles in search\nof scandals from using the Etireno affair to deceive\npeople into believing that the enslavement and selling\n22\n\nof children take place in Benin. But neither malicious\nintentions nor misinformation nor this sort of\nintellectual terrorism will prevent us from making\nprogress in terms of democracy, the protection of\nwomen and the protection of children from the abuse\nthey still suffer in all the countries of the world,\nparticularly in poor, underdeveloped countries.\nThe Millennium Declaration gave special\nattention to Africa under the heading \u201cMeeting the\nspecial needs of Africa\u201d. One year later, the countries\nof Africa are still waiting for action to begin to be\ntaken on those promises. However, Africans are no\nlonger willing to wait and have taken their fate into\ntheir own hands by creating the New Partnership for\nAfrica\u2019s Development. The partnership is a\nconsequence of the newly restored confidence of\nAfricans in their own abilities. It is aimed at placing\nthe historic initiative in the hands of Africans\nthemselves, without in any way renouncing\ninternational cooperation. An important step has thus\nbeen taken with this new African joint initiative.\nAfricans finally have hope that their continent\nwill cease to be the continent of disease, poverty,\nmisery and bloody conflicts and that a real partnership\ncan be created between us and the rest of the world. It\nis our wish that this hope will become reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to\noffer the congratulations of the delegation of Saint\nLucia to the President of the General Assembly on his\nelection. We wish to assure him of our full support for\nthe successful outcome of these deliberations.\nAs we meet with the global fraternity of nations\nduring this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly,\nSaint Lucia once more joins its voice with those who\nhave deplored and condemned the despicable acts of\nterror of 11 September 2001, that so brutalized our\ngreat host city, New York, and our host country, as they\ncruelly and callously extinguished thousands of\ninnocent and vibrant lives. We are however heartened\nby the universal resolve of all peace-loving nations to\nrid the earth of the scourge of terrorism. We have\nnoted, too, how quickly and steadfastly some of these\nnations have come together as a coalition in pursuit of\nthat endeavour and have embarked on a war against\nterrorism.\nWe should, however, recognize that the defeat of\nthis type of terrorism, as laudable and desirable an act\nas it may be, will not by itself create a greater\nhumanity or a better world. For there are billions in the\nworld today who have not been at war, but who have\nnot known peace; they suffer from other terrors. There\nare millions, so many of whom are children, who\nsuccumb daily to the horrors of malnutrition and\nstarvation. There are still millions of others who are\nwasting away from disease. Thousands of people see\ntheir human rights violated on a daily basis. We\ntherefore need to remind ourselves that there are many\nother issues that have been engendering their own\nbrand of fear and conflict in the world today, and that\nmore often than not the underlying cause of such\nconflict is the lack of economic and human\ndevelopment.\nIf we are to attain greater humanity, and if we are\nto create a better world, we must commit ourselves to a\ngreater collective responsibility towards all those other\nissues. We must adopt the same rapid global militaristic\nresponse to solving them as that in the new war on\nterrorism. Some of these issues have been with us for\ntoo long and by now should have disappeared from the\nworld agenda. Our fragile humanity cannot endure\nanother century of widening disparity between and\nwithin nations. We can no longer withstand the silent\nbattle between the haves and the have nots. Humanity\ncannot tolerate ever increasing disease, deprivation,\nhunger, illiteracy, poverty, economic strife and war.\nFor the ideal of a greater humanity not to\ncontinue to elude us, we must now found it on this new\nattitude, this new vision, in which people everywhere,\nnations everywhere, are galvanized into higher levels\nof cooperation in pursuit of these common concerns, in\n39\n\nparticular concerns such as the guarantee of economic\nand social security, sustainable development and\ngovernance of the multilateral trading system. In this\nnew philosophy of cooperation, the United Nations\nmust play the central role.\nIt is from this perspective that Saint Lucia\nreiterates its call for the adoption of a holistic approach\ntowards poverty eradication. Saint Lucia is firm in its\nview that the United Nations is the only Organization\ncapable of pooling the requisite knowledge and\nfinancial resources for global action against poverty.\nInternational cooperation on poverty eradication must\ngive due consideration to, among other things, debt\nforgiveness through concerted support for an improved\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\nInitiative. It must ensure special and differential\ntreatment on a contractual basis for developing\ncountries and sustained financial support for the\nOrganization\u2019s development programmes.\nThe HIV/AIDS plague, which continues to ravage\nthe world, also demands this new collective response.\nSaint Lucia acknowledges that the United Nations has\nalready begun spearheading the global fight against\nHIV/AIDS. The United Nations special session on\nHIV/AIDS has done a great deal to raise global\nawareness about the magnitude of the pandemic. Saint\nLucia also welcomes the establishment of the Global\nAIDS and Health Fund, which is intended to increase\nthe ability of the global community to combat this\nscourge. However, if humanity is to win the fight\nagainst this twentieth century plague, the international\ncommunity must make available new and additional\nfinancial resources towards research and the\ndevelopment of affordable drugs. We stress that these\ndrugs must be cheap and widely obtainable. It is time\nthat corporations cease putting the acquisition of more\nand more profit ahead of the health and lives of the\nunfortunate who have been afflicted by diseases such\nas AIDS. Are we not being inhumane when our\noverriding objective is to make as huge a profit as\npossible on the sickness of so many, rather than\nensuring that the essential drugs that they need to end\ntheir suffering are easily available?\nAs we survey the multilateral trading system,\nSaint Lucia continues to be concerned that the thrust\ntowards allowing market forces to totally determine the\nscope, structure and outcomes of economic activity is\nnot being counterbalanced by mechanisms to fairly\ndistribute welfare gains and to protect the more\nvulnerable, small States like Saint Lucia from the\nconsequences of market failure.\nThe perilous state of the banana industry in Saint\nLucia and the other Windward Islands of the Eastern\nCaribbean is the painful outcome of that thrust, an ill-\nadvised policy of globalization and trade liberalization\nat all costs. The charge of World Trade Organization\n(WTO) incompatibility that was made against the\npreferential trade regime, justly accorded to Saint\nLucia and other Agricultural Commodities Committee\nbanana-producing countries under the Lom\u00e9\nAgreement, has brought about the near collapse of this\nvital industry. Saint Lucia welcomes the recent\ninitiative by the United States for a new licensing\nagreement for the trading of bananas on the European\nmarket, an initiative that brought an end to the\ndebilitating banana war with Europe.\nSaint Lucia once more wishes to place on record\nits deep appreciation for the perseverance and fortitude\nof the European Union, which stood by its international\nobligations throughout these years of dispute. We\napplaud the news just in from Doha that, after 18\nmonths, a WTO waiver has finally been granted to the\nCotonou Agreement, thus paving the way for the\nimplementation of the new banana-marketing\narrangements. We hope that these recent developments\nare not too late to save our industry. But the case of the\ngreat banana dispute will always remain as a striking\ntestimony to the inequities of the liberalized trading\nsystem.\nSaint Lucia is also concerned about the actions of\nseveral organizations, such as the World Economic\nCouncil and the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD), which seem to\nbe attempting to usurp the traditional roles and\nfunctions of the United Nations and of national\nGovernments. In the face of the near demise of the\nvital banana industry, Saint Lucia and the other islands\nof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n(OECS) sought to diversify their economies by\nbuilding on their competitive advantage in offshore\nfinancial services. But OECD countries denounced our\nefforts as being harmful to them, and resorted to\nbranding Caribbean offshore financial services as\nhavens for criminal activity. For us, this is a violation\nof our territorial integrity, our sovereignty and our\neconomic rights. Saint Lucia accepts that it has an\nobligation to ensure that its financial services are not\nused by unscrupulous individuals and interests.\n40\n\nHowever, Saint Lucia cannot, in all good conscience,\nsurrender its sovereignty to a governance system\nimposed by a few.\nIn the face of these selfish actions by developed\ncountries and the myopia of globalization, the role of\nthe United Nations in bringing order into the system\nhas become even more pressing. Saint Lucia therefore\nrenews its call for a rebirth of the United Nations\nsystem, not only as an organization concerned with\npeacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions,\nbut also as an institution that is capable of effectively\ngoverning the global economic system in a way that\nensures an equitable redistribution of the benefits of\neconomic growth. We need a United Nations that will\nsafeguard against global economic crises and promote\nthe adoption of sustainable developmental policies.\nIn that context, and with the emerging spectre of\na global economic recession, the upcoming United\nNations Conference on Financing for Development\nbecomes even more relevant, even more urgent. That\nConference is of enormous importance to the small\nisland developing States of the Caribbean, faced as we\nare by low aggregate gross domestic product, low\ndomestic savings and investment capacity and\nundeveloped financial markets. The development\nagenda of the Caribbean region cannot proceed without\nthe requisite financing, nor can it be sustained without\nan enabling international environment. We must all\ntherefore commit ourselves to ensuring the success of\nthe Conference.\nOur renewed call for the rebirth of the United\nnations is further prompted by the observation that it is\nsystematically being displaced as a source of guidance\nand as a fount of collective wisdom on global issues.\nWe fear that if the United Nations continues to be\nmarginalized in determining global development\npolicies and strategies, then the concerns of developing\ncountries will be excluded from the global agenda. A\nrecent example of this is the decision not to include\nissues relating to the implementation of the Programme\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States in the preparatory meetings\nfor the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We\nsee this as undermining the spirit of the United Nations\nresolution that convened the United Nations Global\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small\nIsland Developing States, held in Barbados in 1994.\nIndeed, it was recognized then that the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development had not\npaid sufficient attention to the special circumstances of\nsmall island developing States.\nThere are two other examples of United Nations\ninaction that leave us very concerned. Saint Lucia\nlaments the adoption by the United Nations of a\nwatered down instrument on small arms. In small\nisland developing States like Saint Lucia, growing\neconomic instability has given rise to increased levels\nof drug-related crime. In the Caribbean region, small\narms are used in most of the violent crimes that are\ncommitted against our law-abiding citizens. The global\ntrade in small arms must therefore be stemmed in the\ninterest of peace and stability. A weak small arms\ndocument was therefore not what we required.\nWe remain deeply concerned that the Plan of\nAction for the first International Decade for the\nEradication of Colonialism did not result in the\ndecolonization of the remaining 17, mostly small\nisland, Non-Self-Governing Territories. Accordingly,\nwe request, as a matter of priority, that the necessary\nresources and expertise be provided to implement the\nlong-standing resolutions on decolonization and the\ncritical analyses called for in the Plan of Action of the\npresent International Decade.\nI close by extending on behalf of the Government\nand the people of Saint Lucia, our warmest\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\nthe hard-working staff of the United Nations on the\nrecent award of the Nobel Peace Prize. We regard this\naward as an eloquent testimony to the sterling efforts\nof the Organization to build a peaceful world. At the\nsame time, we see the award as a challenge to the\nUnited Nations to remain resolute in its commitment to\nthe multilateral framework and not to allow itself to\nbecome incapacitated by inaction, especially where the\ndefence of human security is concerned.\nWe all recognize that the events of 11 September\nhave brought about a new era in world affairs and new\nchallenges for all of us, in particular for the United\nNations. In the times that lie ahead the United Nations\nsystem must do more that it has done before. It must\nresist the use of force in situations where wisdom is\nneeded. It must work harder at becoming a source of\nhope to the hopeless and a reservoir of power to the\npowerless. It must redouble its efforts to restore the\npreservation of humanity as the highest of all ideals.\nThe horror of 11 September has shocked some of\nus into establishing a coalition against terrorism. It is\n41\n\ntime for the tragedy of underdevelopment to shock all\nof us into forging new coalitions for development. At\nthis juncture, let us use this United Nations, energized\nby its Nobel award, to create these coalitions. Let us\nbuild a coalition in defence of the wretched of the\nearth \u2014 to end their hunger, to terminate their poverty,\nto eradicate their diseases and to forever banish their\nwretchedness.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, my\ndelegation extends profound sympathy to the families\nof the victims who lost their lives on the flight to the\nDominican Republic.\nThe rescheduled general debate now convened,\nwell into the work of the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, only serves to reconfirm our\nawareness of Mr. Han\u2019s great diplomatic and\ncommunicative skills. For this, my delegation thanks\nand congratulates him once again. Under his competent\nleadership we hope this will be a fruitful and decisive\nsession of the Assembly.\nThis being my first opportunity, may I take the\nstand, on behalf of the Government and people of\nGrenada, to heartily congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, and the\nUnited Nations on the designation as recipient of the\nNobel Peace Prize.\nJust as the fifty-fifth session was the Millennium\nAssembly of joy, hope and optimism, this fifty-sixth\nsession, by contrast, can be called the unpredictable\nAssembly of challenge and adversity, from which the\ninternational community can nevertheless derive\nstrength and unity in the pursuit of a common enemy\nwho will eventually be found and brought to justice.\nThe challenge and uncertainty have come about\nbecause terrorism now threatens the entire civilized\nworld. The catastrophic and traumatic events of 11\nSeptember have changed not only the lives of\nindividuals, for whom we grieve so painfully, but it has\nalso changed the modus vivendi and the modus\noperandi of our present-day civilization in many\nrespects. If this cloud of hatred and revenge is allowed\nto prevail, history will long remember that evil\ntriumphed due to inaction.\nThus, the broad international coalition brought\ntogether by the United States of America and supported\nby Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1 stands as a bulwark\nready to break the immoral and physical backbone of\nterrorism. Grenada fully supports and endorses\nresolution 1373 (2001), which sets out important\nmeasures that countries \u2014 large and small, rich and\npoor \u2014 must all take together to prevent and combat\nterrorists in our jurisdictions or wherever they may be\nfound.\nThe newly formed Security Council Counter-\nTerrorism Committee, under the chairmanship of the\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, is a\nwelcome and laudable effort in the struggle that\ndeserves the backing and support of all Member States\nmorally, strategically and financially. In addition, it is\nsoliciting assistance from persons with particular skills\nin the performance of special functions.\nThe Government of Grenada has already begun to\ntake steps within its jurisdiction to implement measures\nwithin our capacity that prevent and suppress the\nfinancing of terrorists acts. Our priority to prevent\nthose who finance, plan, facilitate or commit terrorist\nacts from using Grenada for those purposes against\nother States or their citizens, as well as to find ways to\nintensify and accelerate the exchange and sharing of\ninformation. Grenada is examining its administrative\nand other processes with a view to improving\nefficiency in this regard.\nWe are active in the global fight against\nterrorism. Grenada is cooperating with the United\nStates authorities to ensure that there are no terrorist\nfunds in any of our offshore institutions. Further,\nGrenada has thoroughly examined its economic\ncitizenship programme to ensure that no known\nterrorists had inadvertently been granted citizenship.\nWe are now confident that no such person is an\n16\n\neconomic citizen of Grenada. In light of the changed\nglobal environment and our commitment to assist in the\nfight against terrorism in any way we can, the\nGovernment of Grenada has taken the decision to\nsuspend indefinitely the economic citizenship\nprogramme.\nMoreover, Grenada continues to intensify its\nparticipation in regional and international cooperation\nefforts as we seek to ensure that there are no gaps in\nthe global framework for the fight against this heinous\ncrime. Grenada will reinforce and extend its\ninternational cooperation arrangements in the field of\njustice, policing and law enforcement.\nThe Government of Grenada fully supports the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive and effective legal\nframework to combat terrorism. My country has begun\na review of international conventions already in place,\nwith a view to signing, ratifying and fully\nimplementing them. Those not yet in effect will be\nimplemented. Some of these conventions are within the\nUnited Nations system, while others are of a regional\nor hemispheric nature. Priority is being given to the\nexisting 12 United Nations international conventions\nagainst terrorism \u2014 in particular, the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism.\nIt is necessary for the international community to\nsend a clear and unambiguous signal to terrorists that\ntheir philosophy is fundamentally wrong and totally\nunacceptable. We must stand united in our efforts to\ncombat and eliminate activities aimed at killing\ninnocent people and destroying communities. The\nGovernment of Grenada joins the Caribbean\nCommunity in pledging our full support of efforts to\nconfront terrorism and restore the rights and freedom\nof people the world over. My delegation would like to\nfocus for a few moments on the impact that this\ndastardly act has had nationally, regionally and\ninternationally.\nIn my country, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, the\neffect of the global economic turbulence has hit the\ntourism and aviation sectors hardest. Tourism, the hotel\nindustry and aviation play a synergistic role that is\ncrucial to the economies of most small States in terms\nof foreign exchange and employment.\nThe subregion had already begun to feel the\neffects of the international economic downturn, which\ncaused the deterioration of our fortunes. But it is clear\nthat since the terrorist attacks on the United States of\nAmerica, Grenada and the other members of the\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) are\nsuffering from further reduction in economic activities.\nWe are now severely challenged.\nWe are experiencing shortfalls in revenue\ncollection. Our tourism sector is experiencing a drastic\nreduction in visitor arrivals. Indeed, the International\nMonetary Fund predicts that arrivals in the Caribbean\nregion could fall short by as much as 50 per cent. Our\nair and marine transport are also experiencing severe\nreductions. Regional air carriers have registered as\nmuch as a 45 per cent fall in passenger load since 11\nSeptember.\nThe picture looks bleak, but we are determined\nthat our response must prevent the devastation\nenvisioned by the perpetrators of terror. Soon after 11\nSeptember, the Prime Minister of Grenada and\nChairman of the OECS, The Honourable Dr. Keith\nMitchell, convened a meeting of OECS to discuss the\nimpact on tourism and related activities \u2014 hotels,\nbanks, agriculture, manufacturing and transportation.\nThe subregional meeting of OECS took a number of\ndecisions that will respond to our economic challenges.\nOne such measure is the formation of the Grenada\nNational Economic Council. This will give effect to the\nrevival of sustainable tourism. It will address fiscal and\neconomic performance, and it will give impetus to\nproductivity. In addition, only recently in the Bahamas,\nthe Caribbean Community heads of Government met\nand approved an $18 million joint public/private sector\nemergency tourism promotion programme,\ndemonstrating self-help at its best in the region.\nThe events of 11 September, with the ensuing\neconomic and geopolitical instability, have propelled us\nto reorder our priorities. We need to focus on restoring\nconfidence in international economic and multilateral\ncooperation. As we all know, the member States of the\nWorld Trade Organization do not participate on a level\nplaying field. The developing world is still struggling\nto bridge the economic and social divide in our global\ncommunity. Some were not in favour of the second\nround of negotiations. Yet some States were willing to\nput their differences aside and endeavour to march\ntowards the next stage of economic and multilateral\ncooperation. This is clearly what we aspire to in this\naugust body.\n17\n\nWhile concerns about terrorism have dominated\nthe general debate, and rightly so, mention must be\nmade of the unfinished agenda of the last decade of the\ntwentieth century with respect to social and economic\ndevelopment, central to which is the human person.\nThe following United Nations summit-level\nconferences, which have been held in the past 10 years,\nhave all stressed sustainable development and the\ncentrality of the human person in the process: the\nUnited Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992; the World\nConference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993; the\nInternational Conference on Population and\nDevelopment in Cairo in 1994; the World Summit for\nSocial Development in Copenhagen in 1995; the\nSecond United Nations Conference on Human\nSettlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul in 1996; the World\nFood Summit in Rome in 1996; the Millennium\nSummit in 2000; and the special session of the General\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS in 2001.\nThe question is: How much of the outcome of\nthese conferences has been implemented with respect\nto poverty alleviation, the empowerment of women,\nhealth, education, children and the elderly, trade\nliberalization, economic cooperation, and the sharing\nand transfer of technology? Could it be that these\nconferences and special sessions promised more than\nthey could deliver? Promising too much is as bad as\ndoing too little.\nThe fight against poverty underpins all of those\nthings. To feed the hungry is both a divine and a social\nimperative. Thus, the international community is\nparticularly concerned that the International\nConference on Financing for Development to be held\nnext year in Mexico and the World Summit for\nSustainable Development to be held in South Africa,\nboth so important for small States, should yield\npositive results. The Barbados Programme of Action\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States is still a major and unfulfilled\ncomponent of the process of the United Nations\nConference on Environment and Development, and it\nshould be high on the implementation agenda this time\naround.\nFor more than 40 years an embargo has existed\nagainst a small country in the Caribbean. What this has\ndone is to ostracize the Cuban people and cause them\nundue hardship. What it has achieved is to make the\nCuban people more innovative. The old wounds have\nhealed, the pain has dulled and the cause has\ndiminished. I wish to register Grenada\u2019s support for the\nremoval of the United States of America\u2019s economic\nembargo on Cuba. Members will recall that last year\n167 Member States voted in favour of the removal of\nthat embargo. Only three voted against and four\nabstained. That shows the overwhelming position of\nthe international community against those sanctions.\nTrade, as we know, is important for the development of\nany people, and with the embargo there is no freedom\nof trade between Cuba and the United States.\nIn the wake of the devastation caused in Cuba by\nhurricane Michelle, it is now critical that steps be taken\nto remove the embargo and to give the Cuban people a\nchance to recover from that unstoppable force of\nnature. The easing of the economic embargo against\nCuba could assist in the overall development of that\ncountry, a small nation seeking against all odds to\nmaintain a modern, dynamic society in the Caribbean\nand in Latin America. The lifting of the embargo would\naugur well for friendly cooperative relations among all\nthe countries of this hemisphere.\nNow, I turn to the issue of the Republic of China\non Taiwan. Grenada believes that a country that\nexhibits fortitude and that has moved its economy from\npoor and underdeveloped to affluent and prosperous\ndeserves recognition. A country that consistently shows\ninternational responsibility surely deserves to be\nadmitted to this community of nations. The time has\ncome to reconsider the exclusion of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan from membership of the United\nNations. The Republic of China is home to 23 million\npeople. It is a free and democratic country, and a\npeace-loving member of the international community.\nIn economic terms, the Republic of China on Taiwan is\nthe seventeenth largest economy in the world, the\neighth largest investor in and fourth largest exporter of\ninformation technology products, and the third largest\nholder of foreign reserves. It is preposterous to\ncontinue to keep such a country outside the world\nbody.\nThe Government of Grenada appeals for that\nwrong to be corrected. We are therefore requesting that\nthe United Nations recognize the natural right of the\npeople of Taiwan to become active participants in this\nOrganization. We believe that the Government and the\npeople of Taiwan are seeking to participate in the\nUnited Nations and to contribute constructively to the\n18\n\ninternational community. Grenada urges that they be\ngiven that opportunity and that right.\nGrenada, however, notes with satisfaction the\nadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan into the\nWorld Trade Organisation. It is the hope of my\ndelegation that the past, present and future performance\nof Taiwan as a major democratic and international\neconomic player, although Taiwan is not now a\nmember of the United Nations, will in the not-too-\ndistant future enable it to regain its rightful place in the\nfamily of nations.\nThe United Nations membership must make\nArticle 3 of the Charter a major priority in the next few\nyears. Our founding fathers called for the Organization\n\u201cTo achieve international cooperation in\nsolving international problems of an economic,\nsocial, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in\npromoting and encouraging respect for human\nrights and for fundamental freedoms for all\nwithout distinction as to race, sex, language, or\nreligion.\u201d\nWe must do all in our power to provide added\neconomic opportunities for the developing world. We\nbelieve that trade is one avenue to achieve this. I\ntherefore call on the Economic and Social Council\nactively to pursue undertakings that could create an\nencouraging atmosphere in which Member States could\nhave the opportunity to raise the standard of living of\ntheir peoples. In the current global environment, we\nmust be conscious that inclusion in the processes of the\nglobal economy is vital.\nFinally, I must recall Article 1 of the United\nNations Charter, which calls for the Organization\n\u201cTo maintain international peace and\nsecurity, and to that end: to take effective\ncollective measures for the prevention and\nremoval of threats to the peace.\u201d\nWe must be relentless in our pursuit of the\npurposes of the Organization. Our challenge is to work\ntowards the elimination of terrorist activities. Our quest\nmust be for economic opportunities for all States. And\nour goal should be the peaceful coexistence of all\npeoples of the international community.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to\nparticipate in this historic session on behalf of His\nExcellency Dr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, President of\nthe Republic of Liberia, and to share with the\nAssembly his contribution to this debate.\nI am pleased to congratulate the President on his\non your election as President of the fifty-sixth General\nAssembly. We wish to assure His Excellency of the full\ncooperation of the Liberian delegation.\nMay I also take this opportunity to acknowledge\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\nfor the very able manner in which he conducted the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nBy the same token, I would like to congratulate\nour distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\non his re-election as Secretary-General and for the\ndistinguished recognition he received in being awarded\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, which, without a doubt, is a\nresult of his vision, commitment and the efficient\nmanner in which he has led and continues to lead our\norganization.\nOn 11 September 2001, not very far from this\nplace, which is dedicated to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, the world was\nconfronted with a kind of terrorism that now renders all\nof us vulnerable. This terrorism is not confined to any\none group of people, nor is it confined to any one\ngeographical location, or to any particular ethnic or\nreligious group. Because of its transnational nature, the\nworld must come together and, in a coordinated and\ncollective manner, construct new models in answer to\nthis scourge. We must act without delay, and without\nunnecessary debate. We must act with determination\nand urgency.\n25\n\nThe problem of terrorism today requires that our\nOrganization, the United Nations, should take the lead\nin coordinating and consolidating international efforts\nto tackle the new challenges that it raises. The United\nNations should serve as a catalyst for these efforts, and\nnot another bureaucratic web of inaction and prolonged\ndebate. The United Nations \u2014 the institution that\nhumanity has charged with the responsibility for global\npeace and security \u2014 is today the subject of terrorist\nthreats. We must match our words with deeds; we must\nrespond to this scourge.\nMy Government reiterates its condemnation, in\nthe strongest terms, of the barbaric and heinous acts of\nterrorism perpetrated against the United States, leading\nto unimaginable and enormous loss of lives and\nmassive destruction in New York, Washington, D.C.,\nand Pennsylvania. My Government has made concrete\noffers to the United States Government and the\ninternational coalition, and has taken strong measures\nin keeping with Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nI wish now to proceed to issue of reform of the\nUnited Nations. I believe, like the rest of you, that\nreform implies change towards a more positive\ncondition. And I presume that when we speak of the\nUnited Nations, we speak of nations that have come\ntogether with a common interest to achieve a common\nobjective. In essence, when we speak of reform, we\nmust accept that the conditions under which our\nnations have come together \u2014 with a common interest\nto achieve a common objective \u2014 are no longer\npalatable and require change. The questions that many\nof us continue to debate regard what changes we want,\nand how to achieve those changes.\nHowever, I must interject a fundamental question\nas to whether the conditions, practices and traditions\nexist for a positive change, assuming we mean positive\nfor the collective good. In bringing about any positive\nchange for the collective good, a level playing field\nmust exist, in which the interest of the whole will\nfreely manifest itself in the change. A level playing\nfield should show the following characteristics:\ntransparency; freedom; fairness; and democratic\npractices.\nIn terms of transparency, we must assume a\ncondition in which the operation of and decision-\nmaking process within the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies are open. The Security Council\nshould not deliberate in secrecy, as was the case during\nthe pre-World War II years, in which secret diplomacy\nand alliance formations characterized the period.\nIn terms of freedom, we must assume that\nMembers of the United Nations can take decisions in\nthe absence of threats, coercion, fear and retribution.\nIn terms of fairness, we must assume that\ndecisions cannot be taken in contradiction to universal\nmoral imperatives, or to the detriment of the statehood\nof a Member. Sanctions with adverse socio-economic\nand humanitarian consequences should not constitute\npolitical tools available to a few Members.\nIn terms of democratic practices, we must assume\nthat decision-making will be reflective of the will of\nthe majority and not of a few; that all Members will\nhave an equal say and equal participation.\nUnfortunately, the contrary of these preconditions\nconstitutes the status quo today with regard to the\nfunctioning of the United Nations. How can we assume\nthe possibility of reform in the absence of a level\nplaying field?\nReform can be meaningful only in the context of\nthe alteration of the spirit of the Charter. That, as I\nhave suggested, would assume the presence of a level\nplaying field. However, we must all admit that the\nconcept of reform has gained currency only because of\nan attempt to admit emerging Powers into the elite\ngroup of permanent members of the Security Council.\nSuch an attempt has provoked an outcry against the\nprivilege of the few, and the challenge is how to admit\nthese emerging Powers without disrupting the existing\nallocation of privilege. Privilege is never surrendered.\nIt is shared only when the political structures compel\ninclusion.\nReform will not occur within the United Nations\nuntil structural changes take place in the distribution of\npower and more non-traditional Powers emerge. It\nwould therefore be an exercise in futility to expect\nconcrete reforms in the United Nations without\nstructural changes. And what we assume to be reform\nis essentially an adjustment occasioned by structural\npressures. This adjustment would be limited to\naccommodating the newly emerging Powers, while\nappeasing the less powerful States through\nparticipation without power. The conferral of the right\n26\n\nof veto will mark this distinction. A permanent seat\nwill no longer be synonymous with the right of veto.\nFor the less powerful, the struggle will not be\nabout power, but participation by affiliation, a sort of\nstatus club. Prestige is a preoccupation of the national\ncharacter, which, despite its superficiality, will be\npursued by States seeking to distinguish themselves\nfrom the crowd. Hence, the focus of the less powerful\nwill be to join the club, and not the pursuit of the more\nimportant goal of integration, which is the only answer\nfor the conversion of the less powerful into emerging\nPowers that would compel adjustment through\nstructural pressures. Debate is not the mechanism of\nchange.\nIndividual less powerful States can hope to\nemerge as powerful States only through a process of\nintegration within regional groupings where power in\nits entire composite is integrated into a common power\ncapability. This would require integration of economic,\nmilitary, technological, human, political and social\nresources into an integrated regional capacity. Only\nwhen this objective is achieved will the structure of the\ninternational political system yield to adjustment.\nAfrica cannot, with all of its potential, continue to\nstand by and accept being condemned to perpetually\noccupy the position of the least developed continent.\nThe African culture, heritage and value systems stand\nthe risk of being lost in the sea of normative ethics\nbased on Western values. Africa should not miss the\nopportunity of the new African Union to achieve\nmeaningful integration and cooperation within the\ncontext of building a powerful African capability that\nwill allow Africans a say in our common world. This\nwill require a new pragmatism, commitment, vision,\ncooperation and sacrifice on the part of African\nleaders. The United Nations can work for Africa; we\nshould learn from the successes of the power brokers\nwho have made the United Nations an important\ninstrument of their foreign policy.\nLiberia is a small country in West Africa that\nsuffered seven years of civil war from 1990 to 1997.\nDuring the years of the civil war most institutions were\ndestroyed, and a major brain drain resulted, as many\nLiberian professionals travelled abroad to better\nconditions. The war also resulted in the destruction of\nbasic infrastructure, including power-generating plants,\nwater plants, schools, hospitals, airports, bridges and\nprivate property. Over 666,000 Liberians ended up as\nrefugees and over a million as internally displaced\npersons. More alarming was the failure of the\ninternational community to assist in the reintegration of\nover 60,000 former combatants who remained\nunemployed and idle.\nIn 1997 a constitutionally elected Government\nwas inaugurated facing the challenges of restoring a\nnation that had been destroyed by war. Four years later,\nthe infant Government still faces an unsympathetic\ninternational community; it has received no official\ndevelopment assistance, and donor assistance for\nUnited Nations agencies and the non-governmental\norganizations operating in Liberia has declined over the\npast four years. The current unemployment rate is 85\nper cent, while 80 per cent of the population lives\nbelow the poverty line. According to the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the illiteracy rate is estimated\nat 80 per cent. Half of all school-age children do not\nattend school. Infant mortality stands at 134 out of\n1,000 live births.\nDisability prevalence in the population is 16.4 per\ncent, of which 12.7 per cent is war-related. The World\nHealth Organization rate for a post-war country is\nbetween 7 per cent and 10 per cent. The prevailing\ncauses of disabilities are alarming, with 91.5 per cent\nacquired due to trauma and diseases. About 21 per cent\nof urban dwellers and 80 per cent of rural dwellers\nhave no access to safe drinking water. Access to\nadequate sanitation is unavailable to approximately 70\nper cent of the population. An estimated 8 per cent of\nthe population is reportedly infected with HIV.\nSince 1999, dissidents have waged war in Lofa\nCounty against the constitutionally elected Government\nin Liberia, further exacerbating the already vulnerable\nhumanitarian situation in the country. Death,\ndestruction, displacement of populations and an\nincrease in Liberian refugees have contributed to what\nthe United Nations agencies call a humanitarian crisis\nin Liberia.\nThe Liberian Government\u2019s capacity to defend its\nterritorial integrity has been impaired by a United\nNations arms embargo, despite the right to self-\ndefence, as expressed in Article 51 of the United\nNations Charter. The Security Council has taken no\nmeasures to prevent the ongoing killing of innocent\nLiberians, especially women and children, who are the\ntargets of atrocities committed in Lofa county by armed\ndissidents.\n27\n\nThis country, a victim of war, poverty and\ndisease, is today also the victim of a regime of punitive\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council in its\nresolution 1343 (2001). The representative of the\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\nHumanitarian Affairs told the Security Council on 5\nNovember 2001 that the humanitarian situation in\nLiberia today is \u201cabysmal\u201d. (S/PV.4405, p. 32) Since\nthe imposition of sanctions by the Security Council,\nand despite the claim by the Council that the sanctions\nwould not have any adverse effects on ordinary people,\nsocio-economic indicators show that the living\nconditions of the Liberian people have declined\ndramatically. Available statistics show a direct\ncorrelation between the imposition of sanctions and the\ndecline in the living standards of the Liberian people.\nThe Security Council has imposed a global travel\nban on more than 100 Liberians, without any\nrationalization. My Government has requested the\nSecurity Council to make known its criteria for the\ninclusion of persons subject to the travel ban. This\nminimal element of transparency and justice has been\ndenied the Liberian Government. Among those\nsubjected to the travel ban are the sick, invalids,\nbusinessmen, wives and ex-wives. What a frightening,\nalarming and dangerous precedent the Security Council\nhas set. Liberia speaks not for itself, as it has already\nbeen victimized, but for the rest of you here, who may\nfind similar treatment meted out against yourselves\ntomorrow.\nI await impatiently for a tomorrow when there\nwill be redress from the injustice my country suffers,\nwhen all of you here will no longer be obliged to\nenforce unjust sanctions. Today, I am impatient to hear\nthe General Assembly voice its opposition to the\nsuffering imposed upon Liberian children, women and\nelderly persons. I impatiently wait for each and every\nmember of the Security Council to respect the human\nrights of my people. I am impatient for the day when\nthe United Nations will no longer be an instrument that\nis used to cause the suffering of innocent people. The\nGovernment of Liberia calls upon the Security Council\nto lift all sanctions imposed upon it and to bring to an\nend the suffering of the Liberian people.\nAt the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, in 1971, a major decision was taken\nthat to date has had far reaching implications. On 25\nOctober of that year, after two decades of debate, by\nvirtue of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI)\nadopted by a vote of 76 in favour, 36 against and 17\nabstentions) the Republic of China was expelled from\nthe world body. By that decision, a founding Member\nand its population \u2014 at that time of 14 million\npeople \u2014 were effectively prevented from associating\nwith the rest of the world. Nothing in the Charter\njustified such a decision, yet a precedent was set that is\nstill unsurpassed. Nevertheless, it is the conviction of\nthe Liberian Government that the now 23 million\npeace-loving people of the Republic of China should be\nallowed representation and participation in our world\nbody. It is also the hope of the Liberian people that the\ngreat Chinese people will one day be peacefully\nreunited under the principles of democracy and human\nrights.\nIn conclusion, permit me to allay the anxieties of\nall those who are preoccupied with the existing\nsituation between the members of the Mano River\nUnion. The leaders of the three Mano River Union\nStates have resolved to put all of their differences aside\nand not to return to the destructive process of\napportioning blame. We are a single people bound by\nblood, culture and language. We are bound by a\ncommon destiny that links us inextricably to one\nanother and is capable of withstanding ephemeral\ndifferences. I wholly agree with President Cont\u00e9 of\nGuinea when he described our quarrel as a family\nmatter. Our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters,\nand mothers and fathers have commenced the process\nof reconciliation and confidence-building in Freetown,\nConakry and Monrovia. So far, a number of significant\ndecisions have been taken at the level of ministers for\nforeign affairs and the Joint Security Committee. We\nask for the Assembly\u2019s support in that process.\nI would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge the\ntrue fraternal solidarity and support of the Economic\nCommunity of West African States, which has stood\nthe test of all of our challenges and difficulties and\nremains focused on the objective of peace. We too will\nremain focused on the objective of peace.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like at the outset to express the\nprofound sympathy and condolences of Cameroon to\nthe Government and the people of the United States of\nAmerica and of the Dominican Republic for the\naccident involving the American Airlines Airbus on 12\nNovember in New York.\nIt was also with great dismay and sadness that we\nlearned of the natural disaster that struck the brotherly\npeople of Algeria with such severity. On behalf of the\npeople and the Government of Cameroon, I would like\nto extend to that country our most profound\ncondolences and solidarity.\nRarely has a session of the General Assembly\nbeen such a focus of international public attention or\naroused the interest of the worldwide media to the\nextent that the current session has. The annual session\nof the General Assembly is a powerful symbol of the\ncoming together of nations, the promotion of cultures\nand respect for differences and freedoms. This year,\nhowever, a shadow has been cast over our session by\nthe recent, terrible attacks of 11 September, which took\nplace not far from here. Cameroon addressed that\nsubject at length during the debate on international\nterrorism that took place on 5 October. I should\ntherefore simply like to reaffirm, on behalf of His\nExcellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of\nCameroon, our sincere condolences to the families that\nhave suffered as a result of the tragedy, as well as our\nsolidarity with the city of New York and the\nGovernment of the United States.\nWe must, of course, emerge from this period of\nmourning. We must unite our forces to eliminate the\ncentres of destruction that are responsible for this\ntragedy. Each of the States Members of the United\nNations, acting together, must nip international\nterrorism in the bud before it spreads any further.\nLowering our guard when confronted with this great\nperil, or appearing to be helpless in the face of the\ncriminal fanatics who are sowing terror, would expose\neach State and each individual on earth, turning them\ninto potential victims of this lethal danger.\nThe President of the General Assembly, Mr. Han,\ncomes from Korea, whose patient, wise and resolute\npeoples have long been engaged in a courageous\npolitical struggle to heal the wounds of the past. We are\nconvinced that he will be able to guide the Assembly at\nits fifty-sixth session through this period of great\nturbulence. He can rest assured of my delegation\u2019s full\nsupport.\nThe delegation of Cameroon would also like to\nexpress its gratitude to his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Harri Holkeri, who presided with great skill over\nthe work of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession. He perfectly reflected the modest, generous\nand supportive character of Finland.\nThe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United\nNations and its Secretary-General is cause for hope and\noptimism for the development of the Organization.\nCameroon welcomes that dual tribute. As the head of\nState of Cameroon said in his message of\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Africa is\nproud that the Oslo jury chose to honour Kofi Annan.\nThat award strengthens and reaffirms the unanimity\nand confidence of the General Assembly, which\npresided over the re-election \u2014 an election that seemed\nquite natural \u2014 of that great servant of the peoples of\nthe United Nations for a second mandate as Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization.\nIndeed, all States Members of the United Nations\nmust be proud that the Nobel Peace Prize was also\nawarded to the Organization. It is the first time in the\nhistory of the United Nations that the Organization\nitself has been honoured with such a distinction. That\ngesture confirms \u2014 if such a confirmation was\nneeded \u2014 that the Organization, in which we are all\nplayers, is truly a major instrument of world peace that\nembodies all of our hopes for a better world.\nAs an instrument of world peace, the United\nNations took up, the day after the attacks of 11\nSeptember, both the struggle against international\nterrorism and the crisis in Afghanistan. The\ninternational community as a whole, through Security\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions, was able to\nsupport the military intervention carried out against the\npresumed masterminds of those attacks, their networks\nand their Taliban protectors.\nIn the same way that we honour the memory of\nthe victims of New York, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania, we must also honour the memory of the\n32\n\ncivilian victims in Afghanistan, including the three\nFrench and German journalists.\nCameroon, I repeat, believes that the alleged\ncriminals must be held responsible for their actions.\nMoreover, we urge the international community to\nstrive to prevent Afghanistan from re-engaging with\nthe old demons of conflict between the armed clans\nthat have defeated the Taliban today. Cameroon\ntherefore calls for an immediate manifestation of the\nUnited Nations presence in Kabul.\nUnder the powers granted to it by the\ninternational community, in particular under Chapter\nVII of the Charter, the Security Council, with the\nessential support of all Members of our Organization,\nmust swiftly undertake all necessary actions to restore\nand maintain peace in Afghanistan and to provide\nhumanitarian assistance to people who have been left\ndestitute and traumatized by an apparently endless civil\nwar.\nWe must urgently prevent the flames of war from\nspreading inexorably throughout Afghanistan. We must\nalso recall from this rostrum, however, that it is high\ntime to douse the fires that have been burning for\ndecades in Palestine, a land of peace. We must\nextinguish the fires that, conflict after conflict, are\ndevastating the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nthe Great Lakes region, as well as those that have\nconsumed Angola for over 25 years. It is high time\nthat, like those who fought the fires in New York on 11\nSeptember, we act as firefighters to put an end to the\nfratricidal wars of the African continent, Central\nAmerica and other disadvantaged regions of the planet.\nWe must remain vigilant in preserving the particularly\nfragile peace in the Balkans.\nWe are convinced that the best firefighter to\ncontain the ravages of war and the threats that loom\nover peace and security throughout the world is the\nUnited Nations. Without the determination of States,\nhowever, and the respect of those States for\nunanimously adopted rules, it is vain to hope to achieve\nthe result targeted for the Organization by the Charter.\nThe activity of the United Nations will have no effect if\nthe resolutions it adopts to contribute to settling a\nconflict are not respected by the parties concerned and\ninvolved.\nWhy, after more than half a century, have we not\nbeen able to end the conflict in the Middle East, in\nwhich Palestinians and Israelis are in ever more brutal\nand violent opposition? Why can we not find the\nresources necessary to the United Nations to nip in the\nbud the fratricidal wars that have bled and disrupted\nentire regions of the African continent since the dawn\nof independence? These are the persistent questions\nthat haunt international public opinion. Just as all men\nmust naturally be equal before the law, States must be\ntreated on the same footing of equality out of respect\nfor international law and the principles defined by the\nUnited Nations.\nThe implementation of resolutions and\nrecommendations adopted at the Millennium Summit\nwould enable great progress to be made towards the\nworld of harmony that globalization is supposed to\nestablish. Man and the safeguarding of his life and\ndignity, wherever he may live, must be restored as our\npriority. Man and the safeguarding of his life and\ndignity must once again be the central focus of our\nactions, thoughts and concerns.\nThe attacks of 11 September in the United States\nand the spotlighting of international terrorism must\nprompt us to take action, of course, but it must also and\nespecially lead us to reflection. We have seen how the\npromoters of those who thus endanger the new world\norder also invoke a policy of double standards to\njustify their fanatical acts. We have also read in many\nof their communiqu\u00e9s their claim to be leading a\ncrusade on behalf of a religious community that,\naccording to them, has been treated unfairly by others.\nWe understand, finally, that they have also cited the\nliving conditions of many hundreds of millions of\npeople, the poorest of the poor, as an argument for\nfighting that part of the world that plunders and\ndominates them in a spirit of complete indifference. We\nmust do all we can to avoid giving such excuses and\npretexts to individuals and groups who in fact have\nnothing but criminal motives.\nCameroon has maintained and continues to\nmaintain that the United Nations must, more than ever\nbefore, continue to affirm the necessary links of\nsolidarity within the international community and the\nneed for balance in international relations. Support and\ndevelopment assistance for the poorest regions of the\nworld are essentials recalled not only in the resolutions\nof the Millennium Summit, but also at the most recent\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries, held this year in Brussels. The\nrecovery efforts of the countries of the South \u2014 inter\nalia, the New African Initiative on economic matters \u2014\n33\n\nmust be accompanied and supported by the most\nprosperous States. During the annual session of the\nEconomic and Social Council last summer in Geneva,\nover which Cameroon had the honour of presiding,\nthese principles and requirements were broadly\nrecalled and, thank goodness, endorsed.\nIn spite of the commitments undertaken at one\nworld summit after the other, the gap between the\nregions of the North and the South is growing wider by\nthe day. Destitution, poverty, epidemics, the AIDS\npandemic and the technology divide are not matters of\nfate. Over and above solidarity, a more just and\nbalanced practice of commercial exchange, notably\nthrough the opening of markets to the most\ndisadvantaged countries, could also help to bridge that\ngap. The forthcoming International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, to be held next year in\nMexico under United Nations auspices, should provide\nan opportunity for a deeper reflection on these\npriorities.\nOn 1 January 2002, Cameroon will take its place\nat the Security Council table on behalf of Africa as a\nnon-permanent member. I would like to express on\nbehalf of His Excellency Paul Biya, President of the\nRepublic of Cameroon, all of our gratitude to all of the\nMember States of our Organization for the confidence\nplaced in my country. In the current international\ncircumstances, we realize the full value of this\nconfidence.\nCameroon is committed to fully assuming its\nofficial duties in making its modest contribution, in the\nCouncil, to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to\nexpress, on behalf of His Majesty\u2019s Government and\nthe people of Nepal, and on my own behalf, our\nprofound condolences to the Government and the\npeople of the United States, as well as to the families\nwho lost their loved ones in the unfortunate crash of\nAmerican Airlines flight 587 on 12 November.\nLet me congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nwell-deserved election to steer the fifty-sixth session of\nthe General Assembly. My felicitations also go to the\nother members of the Bureau.\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General on his\nelection to a second term and on being awarded this\nyear\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, together with the United\nNations.\nWe are meeting against the backdrop of the 11\nSeptember terrorist attacks that took innumerable lives\nand caused colossal damage in our host country and\nhost city. The Nepalese people express their full\nsolidarity with the American people in this hour of\ngrief and support the American-led war on terror.\nThe horror\u2019s powerful ripples have been felt\nbeyond the borders of the United States, around the\nworld. They have pushed the already slumping global\neconomy into a recession that is sure to unleash misery\nand starvation on millions of people and kill thousands\nof children in the developing world.\nIn the wake of the terrorist onslaught, the United\nNations was quick to act. It approved fresh measures,\nincluding Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\ncalling on Member States to stem the terrorists\u2019\nchannels of communication, freeze their finances, deny\nthem refuge and support, strengthen domestic and\ninternational law against them and collectively take all\nnecessary measures to prevent and defeat them.\nA broad coalition of States united around a\ncommon goal has launched a global campaign against\nterrorism. Itself being a victim of terrorist activities,\nwhich have taken nearly 1,800 lives over the past five\nyears and have grossly undermined development\nefforts, Nepal fully understands the challenges and cost\nof defeating this elusive enemy that has no borders, no\nterritory and no standing army. Yet with collective\nresolve and determination and with preventive and\ncurative actions we can sniff out the forces of\nterrorism, if we only refrain from political expediency\nand moral relativism.\nEnforcing all the existing relevant conventions\nand resolutions is as crucial as the early conclusion of a\n7\n\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism in order to\nachieve the objective.\nThe twenty-first century begins with a new and\nuncertain security environment. No sooner had we put\nthe wars, and the cold war, of the last century behind us\nand had begun to grapple with internal conflicts than\nterrorism emerged as a grave threat to international\npeace and security. It should be tackled decisively and\nwithout delay.\nAs we engage in the war on terrorism, we must\nnot forget that the edifice of durable peace can be\nerected only on the fundamental pillars of the\nprevention of conflicts, the peaceful resolution of\ndisputes, persistent efforts for disarmament, poverty\nreduction and development, and respect for diversity,\nfairness and justice. The culture of peace and dialogue\nshould advance the process.\nWe now live in a global village where all are\ninterdependent. A fire in one house may consume the\nentire village if left unchecked. That is why concerted\nefforts to secure peace and stability are critical in the\ntroubled nations of Africa, Asia, Europe and elsewhere\nthat have suffered wanton instability and violence that\nare pernicious for their national integrity, social\nharmony and economic progress.\nIn particular, we will have to end the cycle of\nviolence and death in the Middle East by finding a\ndurable solution to its festering problem. The war on\nterror and the restoration of stability will succeed in\nAfghanistan if its people are saved from starvation and\nunwarranted hardship now and assured of their\ncountry\u2019s reconstruction when the struggle is over.\nCriminal acts such as those involving the present\nanthrax scare in the United States and the use of sarin\ngas in the Tokyo subway a few years back are strong\ntestimony to the necessity of abolishing biological and\nchemical weapons before an appalling catastrophe\nbefalls us. More importantly, the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons and the increasing likelihood of their\nuse by terrorists, viewed in the context of the\nsuccessful 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, constitute compelling reasons to follow the\npath of complete and general nuclear disarmament.\nThe inability of the Conference on Disarmament\nto agree on its programme of work for the past several\nyears raises serious doubts about our commitment to\ndisarmament. That forum should be activated without\ndelay and should be tasked with negotiating new\ndisarmament treaties, including one on nuclear\ndisarmament, and to strengthen the existing ones.\nIn order for United Nations peace efforts to\nbecome instrumental in promoting global peace, Nepal\nhas lent them moral backing, has contributed nearly\n40,000 troops and has sustained 42 casualties in the\nline of duty. Nepal is willing to work for the\nimprovement of peacekeeping operations, taking into\naccount both the Brahimi Panel report and our\ncollective experience.\nWhile we are preoccupied with the immediate\nsteps against terrorists, we must not overlook or\nabandon other equally pressing issues central to\ndurable peace, such as the need to remove poverty,\ncreate jobs and provide education, drinking water,\nhealth and other basic services in poor countries. The\nreason is simple: terrorists and anarchists often exploit\nthe vulnerabilities of the impoverished, the\nunemployed, the excluded and the disaffected to carry\nout their sinister designs.\nOf course, poor countries have no choice but to\nundertake painful reforms to improve their governance\nand performance. Decreasing assistance to the poor in\nthe face of increasing prosperity in the rich countries\ndefies our understanding. Therefore, it is equally\nurgent and essential that they receive increased support\nfrom their development partners.\nFor example, rich countries need to reverse the\ndecline in development assistance and meet the aid\ntargets, fully fund and expand the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to cover all least\ndeveloped and worst affected countries and facilitate\ninvestment in the South. Their trade barriers ought to\nbe dismantled and markets opened to spur exports and\nhelp to broaden the production capacities of developing\ncountries.\nAs the advanced nations seek to hammer out a\nstimulus package to extricate their economies from the\ndark shadow of the present economic downturn, they\nmust also be mindful of the much greater needs of\npoorer nations at this time of economic hardship.\nUndoubtedly, all developing countries face\nserious obstacles to their development journey. But\nlandlocked developing countries suffer from the\n8\n\nadditional impediments of remoteness, transit-transport\ndifficulties and lack of access to sea-based resources.\nHowever, nowhere are the trauma of deprivation\nand dispossession and problems of development more\nstaggering than in the least developed countries,\nvirtually all of which are in Africa and Asia.\nGlobalization has further marginalized them, and the\ninformation revolution has hardly touched them. The\nUnited Nations special programmes of the past two\ndecades have apparently been inadequate and unable to\nmake a difference, as many of these countries have\nbecome increasingly worse off over the last decade.\nNepal is committed to vigorously implementing\nthe outcome of the Third United Nations Conference\non the Least Developed Countries. We sincerely hope\nthat our development partners will leave no stone\nunturned in carrying out their commitments, including\nthe European Union\u2019s \u201ceverything but arms\u201d scheme.\nConflicts and chaos, and deprivation and disasters\ncontinue to spawn humanitarian problems and to create\nsituations in which human rights are compromised.\nToday there are 22 million refugees, including 100,000\nin Nepal, and many more internally displaced persons\naround the globe. Responding to such exigencies is\nnaturally a priority, as is the war on terror, but we must\nbear in mind that humanitarian assistance cannot\nprevent the recurrence of crises until people are\nempowered and their vulnerabilities addressed.\nI should like to take this occasion to thank the\ninternational community for its support in the\nmaintenance of refugees in Nepal. We urge it to\ncontinue its assistance until the problem is resolved,\nleading to their repatriation. To this end, we are\nengaged in dialogue with the Government of the\nKingdom of Bhutan.\nThe need has never been so urgent to protect\nrefugees, maintain ecological balance, preserve the\nenvironment, promote sustainable development and\nensure that this planet remains at least as liveable for\nour children as it has been for us. The strengthening of\nexisting global treaties on the environment, and\nparticularly the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, is\nurgently required.\nNepal, a least developed and landlocked nation,\nhas accorded its topmost priority to poverty reduction,\nspending more than 70 per cent of its budget in rural\nareas where the poorest people live, and has adopted a\nmarket-led development policy with a two-pronged\nstrategy.\nPolicies and measures have been instituted to\nattract foreign investment and to harness people\u2019s\ncreative potential by means of economic liberalization,\ninvestment incentives, decentralization and the\nrationalization of public spending priorities. Of late, we\nhave taken steps towards land reform, the\nempowerment of women through education,\ninheritance rights and political participation, together\nwith special developmental programmes to assist weak\nand vulnerable people and regions.\nYet progress has been slow in coming, with the\nattendant serious consequences. Nepal\u2019s per capita\ngross national product of $220 is one of the lowest in\nthe world; 38 per cent of the population lives below the\npoverty line; and the ratio of the Government\u2019s foreign\ndebt stock to government revenue is 410 per cent, and\nto annual exports, 350 per cent. These statistics are\nincredibly disheartening, even among the least\ndeveloped countries.\nDespite this, Nepal is left out of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I therefore\nurge the donor community to include Nepal in the\nInitiative to help release our resources from debt-\nservicing obligations, which will enable us to\nimplement poverty-reduction programmes more\neffectively. But this will in no way substitute for the\nneed for increased development assistance.\nThe United Nations has an elemental role to play\nin meeting all these challenges. To prepare it to address\nthem, Nepal believes that we should revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil and augment cooperation and coordination\namong the various United Nations organs. Likewise,\nwe deem it imperative to enlarge the Security Council\nand to improve its methods of work, including through\nthe deepening of its cooperation with troop-\ncontributing countries.\nVeto power militates against the basic tenets of\nequality and democracy; it reflects the realities of a\nbygone era. Nepal is convinced of the necessity to do\naway with the veto and understands the profound\ndifficulty of achieving this goal. Until it has been\neliminated, this power ought to be rationalized by\ndefining the parameters for its application.\n9\n\nThe Millennium Declaration has given us a vision\nof and benchmarks for a peaceful, decent, just and\nviable global society, and it has indicated how the\nUnited Nations could be instrumental in achieving\nthem. It is our collective obligation to implement them,\nsharing the burdens and benefits equally. Nepal\nwelcomes the road map for the implementation of the\nDeclaration.\nThe implementation review of various global\ncompacts has unmistakably established a shortage of\nfinancial resources as the principal reason for lack of\nprogress. Nepal hopes that the World Summit on\nSustainable Development and the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year, will do their best to chalk out a blueprint for\nfinancing developmental activities, which is the\nforemost concern of the developing world.\nAs regional cooperation is an effective vehicle for\nbroadening markets and production as well as for\nbuilding collective competitiveness, Nepal and other\nSouth Asian countries have been working together\nunder the umbrella of the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC). I am happy to inform\nthe Assembly that Nepal will have the privilege of\nhosting its next summit in January 2002, following its\npostponement two years ago.\nAgain, in the spirit of regional solidarity and of\nits abiding commitment to peace and disarmament,\nNepal looks forward to the early relocation of the\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia\nand the Pacific to Kathmandu, where it belongs. We\nhave, on our part, completed all necessary preparations\nfor the effective functioning of the Centre from Nepal.\nDemocracy, development and human rights are\nintegral to society\u2019s advancement. Therefore, Nepal is\nengaged in promoting democracy and freedom, and\nhuman rights and justice for all, particularly women,\nchildren and vulnerable groups. We cherish these\nvalues, which are crucial to preserving human dignity\nand to bestowing on human beings the opportunity to\nreach their full potential.\nIn the aftermath of the agonizing royal massacre\nin Nepal early this year, our people\u2019s faith in\ndemocracy has been further reinforced, as it ensured a\nsmooth succession and stability in the face of a terrible\ncrisis. I thank all our friends for their solidarity and\nsupport at a time of national tragedy in Nepal.\nWe have witnessed unprecedented unity among\nnations in fighting major wars in the past, and\nterrorism at present. If we show the same kind of\nresolve and dedication, we can successfully fight\npoverty, deprivation and discrimination. The United\nNations should brace itself to face them effectively, and\nMember States should assume a greater sense of\nresponsibility. Nepal, committed as it is to the\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations, will\ncontinue to do its best to help it achieve its goals and to\nmake a difference in our people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\n"

It is a tribute to the\nimportant contributions your country, the Republic of\nKorea, has made throughout the past years to the work\nof our Organization.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nhis outstanding and effective leadership of our\nOrganization. The prestigious Nobel Peace Prize\nconferred on him is both a recognition of his personal\nachievements and an affirmation of the great and\nlegitimate mission undertaken by the United Nations.\nWe wish him well and much success in his second term\nas head of the United Nations during the next five\nyears.\nThe general debate of the fifty-sixth session of\nthe General Assembly was not able to proceed as\nplanned, as a result of the terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember, which caused thousands of deaths. In the\nwake of this tragic event, the Government of the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic condemned the terrorist\nacts while reaffirming its consistent policy of\ncooperating with the international community in the\nfight against terrorism in all its forms. In this respect,\nin late October, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\ndecided to become party to five international\nconventions on the fight against terrorism.\n10\n\nThis tragedy has generated a set of ensuing\nevents. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic views the current situation with\ngreat concern and considers that it is high time that our\nOrganization played a growing role, in conformity with\nthe United Nations Charter, in the combat against\nterrorism and for the peace and security of the peoples\nof the world.\nSince its inception, the United Nations has made\nan important contribution to the maintenance of world\npeace and international security, as well as to\ncooperation and development in all areas of human\nendeavour. Last year, at the historic Summit, the world\nleaders reaffirmed the relevance and importance of our\nOrganization in the new, globalized world. At that\nsame Summit, we also pledged our commitment to\nensuring that the United Nations adapts to new areas\nand strengthens its capacity to deal with the challenges\nof maintaining world peace and promoting the\ndevelopment of all countries.\nSeveral issues inherited from the last century\nfailed to be addressed. Although the Open-ended\nWorking Group on Security Council reform has spared\nno effort to fully carry out its mandate, the key issues\nof the reform of the Council remain unsettled.\nTherefore, we reaffirm our position in favour of the\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent\nmembership of the Security Council. Equally, we\nsupport the efforts to address the issue of the right of\nveto and to find a solution acceptable to all Member\nStates.\nThe situation in the Middle East has recently\nreached levels of increased violence, causing loss of\nlife, destruction, damage to property and deep sorrow\nand a desire for revenge among both the Palestinian\nand Israeli peoples. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic reaffirms its support for the establishment of\nan independent Palestinian State and for respect for\nIsrael\u2019s right to existence. That would contribute to\nguaranteeing long-lasting peace and security in the\nMiddle East.\nAlmost every year, the General Assembly has\noverwhelmingly adopted a resolution on lifting the\ncommercial and economic embargo against the\nRepublic of Cuba. However, those resolutions have not\nbeen effectively implemented. The Government of the\nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic appeals to the\nUnited States and Cuba to jointly reach a rapid solution\nin the interest of the peoples of the two countries,\nwhich would contribute to promoting peace and\ndevelopmental cooperation in the region and the world.\nOn the Korean peninsula, several events have\nmarked the progress made towards the unification of\nKorea, such as meetings and exchanges of visits of\nleaders at all levels, reunions of families long kept\napart and humanitarian assistance. The Lao\nGovernment has followed these developments closely\nand commends the positive results. Nevertheless, we\nare deeply concerned about the situation prevailing in\nthe region and hope that under the wise guidance of the\nleaders of the two countries, the peaceful unification of\nan independent Korea will be achieved so as to meet\nthe fervent aspirations of the Korean people and to\ncontribute to peace, stability and cooperation in East\nAsia and throughout the world.\nIn South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region,\nseveral outstanding activities to promote peace and\ncooperation have gained prominence in the region and\nthroughout the world. In Hanoi, the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum\nreaffirmed the importance of preventive diplomacy,\nconfidence-building measures and avoiding military\nconfrontation. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) meeting in China was a historic rally of unity\nin the fight against terrorism and in setting goals for\neconomic recovery. The Summit of ASEAN members\nplus China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, held in\nBrunei early this month, stressed the need to combat\nterrorism in all its forms, overcome economic recession\nand promote development cooperation.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic notes\nwith satisfaction that the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\nMay this year, adopted a more realistic plan of action\nto enable the least developed countries to emerge\ndecisively from abject poverty and be integrated into\nthe global economic system. We very much hope that\nthe international community will make joint efforts to\nachieve the development objectives enunciated in that\nplan of action.\nFor many years now, the international community\nhas recognized that the landlocked developing\ncountries are one of the three vulnerable and\ndisadvantaged groups of developing countries. Their\nvulnerable and disadvantaged condition is attributed to\nlack of access to the sea, remoteness from world\n11\n\nmarkets and prohibitive transport costs, averaging 14\nper cent of export earnings, compared to only 8.8 per\ncent for other developing countries.\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, in its\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries, would like to appeal the General\nAssembly to endorse the recommendation made by the\nfifth Meeting of Governmental Experts from\nLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the\ndonor community to convene in 2003 an international\nministerial meeting of landlocked and transit\ndeveloping countries and the donor community on\ntransport cooperation, with the objective of addressing\nthe special problems and needs of the landlocked\ndeveloping countries. In this connection, we wish to\nwelcome the Government of Kazakhstan\u2019s offer to host\nthe meeting.\nBy the end of 2000, there were 36.1 million\npeople worldwide who had tested HIV-positive, of\nwhom 90 per cent live in developing countries. It is our\nhope that the international community will take\nnecessary drastic measures, including through the\nprovision of additional and sustained resources, to\nimplement the Declaration of Commitment on\nHIV/AIDS, adopted during the last special session of\nthe General Assembly.\nAnother issue of global concern is narcotic drugs.\nThe production and abuse of drugs have increased and\nhave become a cause of crime affecting many social\ndimensions. Realizing their own responsibilities,\nASEAN Governments and China convened an\ninternational conference in October 2000 in Thailand,\nwhere a plan of action to make ASEAN a drug-free\nzone by 2015 was adopted. Also, a ministerial meeting\nbetween four countries \u2014 China, Laos, Myanmar and\nThailand \u2014 was held in August this year with the\nobjective of curbing drug production and trade and the\nimporting of chemical precursors in the subregion.\nIn an effort to achieve the goals established by\nthe Political Declaration of the General Assembly\nspecial session held in 1998 and to fully eradicate\nopium production, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic has mobilized the people and,\ntogether with donors and international organizations,\nhas taken various measures through tailoring projects\ninvolving crop substitution, preventive education,\ndrug-addiction rehabilitation and law enforcement. As\na result, in the course of just three years, between 1998\nand 2000, opium-cultivated areas have been reduced\nfrom 26,000 hectares in 1998 to 17,000 hectares in\n2000. The aggregate opium production has also\ndeclined from 140 tons to 117 tons for the same period.\nMoreover, on 12 October 2001, the Lao Government\nlaunched a National Anti-Narcotic Campaign, chaired\nby the Prime Minister, with a view to ensuring that\nLaos is a drug-free country with a social order and a\nbright future for the next generation.\nIn general, over the last year, the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic has enjoyed firm political\nstability and progressive development in all sectors,\nespecially in food security. All this was reflected in the\nsolemn celebration of the twenty-fifth founding\nanniversary of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\nand the successful conclusion of the Seventh Congress\nof the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party. These historic\nevents have profoundly enhanced national patriotism, a\nsense of self-reliance, self-resilience and ownership for\nthe Lao people. In carrying out our mandated task, we\nhave concentrated all our efforts and untapped strength\nto achieve the goals of poverty reduction by halving\nthe number of families currently living under the\npoverty line, stopping slash-and-burn practices, fully\neradicating opium production by the year 2005, and\ncreating an environment that will enable the country to\nquit once and for all the status of least developed\ncountry by the year 2020.\nThe first year of the twenty-first century has\nwitnessed new challenges that pose anxiety and\nconcern for all people worldwide. However, the\ntwentieth century has created institutional foundations\nfor strengthening the legal and cooperative framework,\nmodern technology and partial reform of our\nOrganization. In addition, dialogue and cooperation\nbetween countries in the economic, social and cultural\nfields and in other areas as well continue to be a\ngeneral trend in the world. In this spirit, I believe that\nthe United Nations, a unique and truly universal\nOrganization, reaffirmed by world leaders at the\nMillennium Summit last year, should play a significant\nrole in addressing these new challenges so that we can\nturn our world into a peaceful, happy and prosperous\none.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-sixth session, Mr. Han Seung-soo, on his\nelection to that important and responsible post. On\nbehalf of the Ukrainian delegation, I would like to\nassure him of our full support and to wish him every\nsuccess in his work. I take this opportunity also to\nexpress our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, whose political wisdom and diplomatic skill\nenabled the Assembly to achieve important results at\nits fifty-fifth session.\nA year ago, at the Millennium Summit, we, the\nrepresentatives of the nations of the world, were seen\nas heralds of a new age. At that memorable gathering,\nthe United Nations heard words that gave humanity\nhope for a new and just model of international relations\nin the new century: freedom, equality, solidarity,\ntolerance and mutual responsibility. Those fundamental\nvalues enshrined in the Millennium Declaration\noutlined the path that the peoples of the world will\nfollow in the new era.\nHowever, while striving to breathe the fresh air of\nthe future, we instead swallowed a mouthful of ashes\nand dust. On 11 September the modern world was\nbrutally wounded. The death of innocent people\nshocked all those who cherish the universal values of\nlife and freedom.\nThe terrorist acts that took place in the United\nStates demonstrated that the philosophy of hatred,\nwhich has no religious, ethnic or linguistic affiliation,\nhas become one of the key challenges of the\ncontemporary world. This threat requires an urgent and\nclear international reaction.\nUkraine shares the pain of the American people\nand fully supports the resolve of the United States\neffectively to stand against the perpetrators, patrons\nand instigators of those terrorist acts.\nWe joined the global anti-terrorist coalition\nwithout any hesitation because we recognize the need\nto unite the efforts of the international community to\ncounter new threats.\nThe military campaign in Afghanistan, which\ntargets the core of international terrorism, is the first\nstage, and a necessary element, of these efforts. It is\nalso evident, however, that the Afghan people, who\nlive in a state of permanent humanitarian crisis, have\nbecome hostages to terrorism. As a result, this crisis\ncannot be brought to an end without consistent political\nand diplomatic efforts aimed at finding a solution.\nUkraine welcomes the activities of the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Special Representative, Lakhdar\nBrahimi, and supports their constructive contribution to\nthe stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.\nWe are convinced that efforts to further\nstrengthen and improve international legal mechanisms\nfor combating terrorism should also be given a\npowerful political impetus. In this context, the speedy\nconclusion of work on the draft comprehensive\nconvention on terrorism takes on special importance.\nI am also pleased to mention that the proposal of\nmy country to convene a ministerial meeting of the\nSecurity Council to discuss further steps in the global\nresponse to international terrorism was unanimously\nsupported by the members of the Council. There is no\ndoubt that, in the course of such a meeting, vital steps\n42\n\nwill be taken to identify key means and methods of\ncombating terrorism.\nWe also maintain that there is a need for proper\ninstitutional arrangements to coordinate and\ncomplement the individual efforts of Member States in\ncombating international terrorism and to ensure that the\nlegal instruments we have elaborated are implemented\nin the most efficient manner possible. Any entity of\nthis sort should not become just another bureaucratic\nbody, but, rather, should be an effective mechanism for\ncontributing to the consolidation of international\nefforts in this area.\nTo honour the memory of the thousands who have\nperished in terrorist attacks and to further unite our\nefforts in fighting the scourge of terrorism, I would like\nto propose, on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, to\ndeclare 11 September a United Nations day to combat\ninternational terrorism. I hope that this proposal will be\nsupported by the General Assembly, which would then\nestablish this day as a symbol of our remembrance,\nunity and resolve.\nUkraine welcomes the decision taken this year by\nthe Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace\nPrize to the United Nations and to its Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan. He is exactly the kind of leader\nthe United Nations needs today as it faces new global\nchallenges.\nAre we ready to stand up to these new\nchallenges? Have we fully realized that the\ndeterioration of the situation in the world is due to the\nexisting, deep-rooted international inequality? And,\nfinally, how will the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly be remembered \u2014 as a session that put an\nend to the age of illusions, or as a forum that\nconsolidated the United Nations family?\nThe United Nations is entering a new period of its\nhistory. Ukraine is deeply convinced that, from a\nstrategic perspective, the strengthening of the status of\nthe United Nations as the core of the modern system of\ninternational relations should become the primary task\nof this Organization.\nThe terrorist acts in the United States have united\nand consolidated the international community. Why has\nit taken the tragic loss of thousands of innocent lives\nfor it to realize that there is a vital need for unity of\naction on its part?\nWe believe that the essence of United Nations\nleadership lies in ensuring an effective response to the\nnew challenges to security at both the global and\nregional levels. This role, however, cannot be played\neffectively if we do not improve the existing model of\ndecision-making and implementation at the\ninternational level.\nThat is why my country actively supports the\nreform of the Security Council. We see this reform not\nas a weakening of the foundations of the Council's\nwork, but, on the contrary, as a move that will\nstrengthen them, by ensuring that they better reflect the\nrealities of the modern world.\nThis year, Ukraine is completing its term as a\nmember of the Security Council. I believe that the\nexperience we have gained will contribute to advancing\nthe process of change. We will consistently advocate\nthe need to improve the Security Council's methods of\nwork and to enlarge its membership. As a Central\nEuropean nation, Ukraine will actively lobby for an\nadditional seat on the Council for this region.\nIn our view, special attention should also be paid\nto the philosophy of United Nations peacekeeping\nactivities and to the problem of sanctions. For many\nyears, Ukraine \u2014 which today is among the 10 largest\ntroop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping\nmissions \u2014 has consistently supported the\ndevelopment of effective United Nations preventive\nmechanisms.\nAt the Millennium and Security Council summits\nlast year, the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma,\nemphasized the need for the elaboration of a United\nNations strategy for comprehensive conflict prevention\nbased on the wide use of preventive diplomacy.\nI am pleased to note that the recommendations on\nconflict prevention put forward by Secretary-General\nKofi Annan in his June report echo the proposal made\nby the President of Ukraine. We believe that the United\nNations possesses the necessary experience and\nresources for the enhancement of its role in this field,\nin particular through the establishment of regional\ncentres to monitor potential areas of conflict, as well as\nthrough the more active use of preventive deployment\noperations.\nConcerning the issue of sanctions, we are in\nfavour of the elaboration of a well-balanced\nmethodology for their imposition, implementation and\n43\n\nlifting. This critical lever of influence should not be\nturned into a political boomerang.\nWe are also convinced of the overriding need to\nfurther consolidate international efforts towards arms\ncontrol, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. On the basis of a realistic\nassessment of the potential of the Conference on\nFacilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), we hope that it will\nresult in an increase in the number of parties to this\nTreaty, which was ratified by Ukraine last year.\nI would also like to mention that next month\nUkraine will complete the implementation of the third,\nand last, phase of strategic weapons destruction under\nthe START Treaty. On 30 October, Ukraine destroyed\nits last intercontinental ballistic missile silo. In that\nway we turned one of the important pages in the\nhistory of nuclear disarmament. We are ready to\ncontinue to make our contribution to secure the\neffectiveness of the system of strategic stability in the\nworld.\nUkraine supports further development by the\nUnited Nations of a universal approach to the issues of\nensuring sustainable development and eradicating\npoverty in the world. We hope that the outcome of the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment will be a practical step in mobilizing\nnational and international resources to solve these\nproblems.\nWe also intend to take practical steps to resolve a\nset of environmental protection issues. As a country\nthat still suffers the pain of the Chernobyl tragedy,\nUkraine counts on the further active involvement of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme and other\noperational bodies of the Organization in the process of\neliminating the long-term consequences of this disaster.\nUkraine considers that cultural and spiritual\ndisasters are no less destructive than natural ones. The\ncultural mosaic of the world is the most precious and\ndelicate treasure granted to humanity. Ukraine has the\nhonour to be one of the sponsors of the General\nAssembly draft resolution on the proclamation of the\nyear 2002 as the United Nations year for the protection\nof the world\u2019s cultural heritage, and calls on the\ninternational community to support this initiative.\nVigorous work to protect humanity\u2019s historical and\ncultural heritage is not only a vital necessity, it is also\nour moral responsibility to past and future generations.\nThe year 2001 is an anniversary year for our\ncountry. On 24 August Ukraine celebrated the first\ndecade of its independence. These have been 10 years\nof complex processes. The main result has been\nUkraine\u2019s consolidation as a peaceful and independent\nEuropean State. We have achieved sustainable\neconomic growth as a result of consistent reforms, and\nmy country is an active participant in European\nregional processes.\nUkraine is contributing to the settlement of the\nso-called frozen conflicts, specifically in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia, and Transdniestria, Moldova. As a member of\nGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General for Georgia,\nUkraine is concerned over the slow pace of the\nGeorgia-Abkhaz peace process.\nUkraine takes an active stand concerning the\nsettlement of the situation in the Republic of\nMacedonia. The resolution of the centuries-old Balkan\nproblem is an ambitious and urgent task for Europe in\nthe new century.\nWe also note with concern the escalation of\ntensions in the Middle East during the past year. The\nentire history of the conflict in the Middle East proves\nthat its vicious circle can be broken only through\nrenouncing violence and reviving mutual trust and\ntolerance between the sides to the conflict.\nThe United Nations is beginning a new and\ncomplicated period of its activities. It is up to us to\ndetermine how the Untied Nations comes out of its\nencounter with the new challenges, united or divided. I\nbelieve that the wisdom of this forum, which has been\nnurtured through decades of hard and responsible work,\nshould serve to guarantee an optimistic scenario."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am\ngrateful for the opportunity to address the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I would like to\nextend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nwell-deserved election.\nI would like to join those who spoke before me in\nexpressing my deep condolences to the people of the\nUnited States. The date of 11 September will be forever\ninscribed in our minds and hearts as the symbol of the\nmost blatant affront to civilization and commonly\naccepted values. Regardless of the brutality of the\nterrorist attacks directed against innocent civilians,\nhowever, they failed in the attempt to polarize the\nworld and to undermine the very foundations of our\nsocieties. Those attacks were attacks against all of us,\ntoo. We therefore fully support the approach outlined\nyesterday morning by President Bush.\nYes, the fight against all kinds of terrorism must\nbe determined and precise. It has to target terrorists,\nwho must be apprehended and brought to justice. At\nthe same time, we have to do much more when we are\ntalking about quick and massive help to the innocent\ncivilians of Afghanistan.\nI would like to use this opportunity to recall that\nmy country promptly and resolutely joined the\nworldwide coalition against terrorism. And I am\nconvinced that, by adopting such a clear position, my\ncountry is a part of the solution, rather than a part of\nthe problem, in this particular field. I spoke about this\nmore extensively in this same Hall two days ago on the\noccasion of the meeting devoted to the dialogue among\ncivilizations.\nComing from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\nwas treated by various kinds of fundamentalists and\nradicals as a problematic and questionable Balkan\ncountry because of its multi-ethnic and multicultural\nnature, I am especially sensitive to the type of\nterrorism that misuses religious feelings and, in so\ndoing, jeopardizes local societies and global society.\nThe war against terrorists is justified, but all of us\nwill be losers if we fail to do everything we can to help\nthe innocent people who are suffering today. Our\nexperience in Bosnia and Herzegovina teaches us that\nmilitary intervention, even when complemented by\nhumanitarian assistance, is not enough for a\nsustainable, long-lasting solution.\nAt the same time, we \u2014 and when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I\nmean the international community speaking with one\nvoice, together with local democratic forces, regardless\nof their current strength \u2014 have to have a clear vision\nof a political solution, accompanied by a programme\nfor social and economic development, once the military\nintervention is over. Only such a comprehensive\napproach \u2014 military, humanitarian, political and socio-\neconomic \u2014 will leave no room for the terrorists to\ninterpret the intervention in Afghanistan as a war\nagainst Islam or as a symbol of the clash of\ncivilizations.\nThe terrorists will lose. Without a comprehensive\napproach, we might be losers, too, by the measure of\nethical and universal human values. That is why we\nhave to tackle these areas of future action together,\nstarting today.\nAt a time when humanity has reached for the\nhighest objectives but also carried out the worst deeds,\nthere should be no doubt that the United Nations can\nfulfil its new tasks, confronting old and new\nchallenges, leading in the building of a prosperous\nworld founded no longer on force but on the rule of\nlaw, not on a balance of power but on a balance of\ncooperation.\nThe contribution of the international community\nin achieving progress in my country, Bosnia and\n17\n\nHerzegovina, was particularly visible in the role of the\nUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nthe Stabilization Force, the United Nations High\nRepresentative, the Peace Implementation Council, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nand other members of the family of the international\ncommunity present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nWe particularly recognize and value the role of\nthe United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nin police reform and the substantial upgrading of the\njudicial system. The United Nations family of\norganizations was certainly one of the key players in\nthe development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\nmultiethnic, tolerant and democratic State.\nKnowing that the mandate of the United Nations\nMission in the present form will terminate by the end\nof 2002, we expect the United Nations mission\nactivities to continue in a different form. However, we\nwould like to see a smooth transition without any\ninterruption in these extremely important activities.\nThe noble goals and accomplishments of our\nOrganization were honoured recently, and I would like\nto extend sincere and heartiest congratulations to the\nSecretary-General and the whole of the United Nations\nfor the recognition by the Nobel Peace Prize\nCommittee.\nI would like to inform the Assembly that we have\ndecided to present candidature of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina for a non-permanent seat in the Security\nCouncil for the year 2010. We are convinced that by\ndoing so, we confirm our commitment to contributing\nfully to the work of the United Nations. It would also\nbe a clear sign of advanced stability and normalization\nof life in our country, and particularly of our\ncommitment to economic and democratic development.\nTherefore, we hope that as early as in 10 years from\nnow, Bosnia and Herzegovina will succeed in\nbecoming a member of the most important political\nbody of the United Nations.\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are working daily\nto live up to the vision of a safer and more peaceful,\nstable and self-sustaining country. Our efforts are\ndirected toward three main sets of priorities.\nFirst is the rule of law, through the speedy\nimplementation of the latest Constitutional Court\ndecisions and through proper judiciary and police\nactions fighting terrorism and organized crime,\ncombating corruption, arresting indicted war criminals\nand creating a stable environment for the return of\nrefugees.\nSecond are the further building and strengthening\nof the State\u2019s institutions.\nThird are economic reforms directed to the\nstrengthening of economic activities; establishment of\na single economic space; and setting up the conditions\nfor upgraded education, thus offering a choice for our\nyoung generations to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nand become an inseparable factor in its development\nand future.\nOf course, implementation of the Dayton/Paris\nPeace Agreement and the continuous adjustment and\nupgrading of our legal framework according to\nEuropean standards are the foundation of activities of\nthe authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels.\nOnce again, I would like to express the gratitude\nof my Government to the international community for\nits devoted support of the enduring stability and\ndevelopment of my country. We are determined to\nmove from the position of a patient or passive recipient\nof aid from international organizations and institutions\nto one of a partner in and contributor to international\nefforts. We have to go through the process of being\nfirst a recipient and then a partner in order to finally\nbecome the owner of the changes in our country.\nWe are aware that responsibility for healing the\nconsequences of the war and post-war stagnation, and\nfor the removal of impediments to faster stabilization\nand progress, rest primarily with the political\nleadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The future of\nBosnia and Herzegovina is in its integration into\nEuropean and North Atlantic organizations. The\nestablishment of contractual relations with the\nEuropean Union through the stabilization and\nassociation process is one of the priority strategic goals\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further improvement of\ngood relations with neighbouring countries and\nincreased regional cooperation remain key elements for\nthe stability and development of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and the region.\nRelations with the Republic of Croatia since the\ndemocratic changes in January last year are improving\nevery day, in every sense.\nAs a result of the democratic changes last year in\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and\n18\n\nHerzegovina has established full diplomatic relations\nwith that country, which opened the official channels of\nthe two countries to deal with a number of important\nmatters.\nHowever, a number of issues that burdened\nrelations between the neighbouring countries are still\non the agenda. Some of them have already been solved\nin bilateral meetings, but we are looking forward to\ntackling them more actively.\nToday is exactly one year since the people of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time in 10 years\nof being driven by nationalism, gave less than 50\npercent of their votes to three major ethnic parties. It\ntook us almost four months to establish the new,\ndemocratic, multi-ethnic, Europe-oriented Government\nthat is now in place. We believe that we are on the way\nto striking a proper balance between the necessary\nassistance of the international community and further\ndecision-making by ourselves.\nFinally, I can assure you today that our country\nhas a leadership with a clear vision and is ready to act\naccordingly. For years, Bosnia and Herzegovina was\none of the world\u2019s international and regional problems.\nToday, my country is becoming one of the solutions.\nWith this conviction, we are looking at the important\nchallenges and tremendous tasks that are still ahead of\nus. We must confront them without delay. I am\nstanding here to say we will do it.\n\n\n\n\n"

The office he holds undoubtedly\ncarries enormous responsibility. My delegation offers\nhim all the support and cooperation he needs to fulfil\nhis mandate. I wish here to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his efficient\nstewardship of the last session of the Assembly.\nLet me take this opportunity to warmly\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan, jointly\nwith the United Nations, on the well-deserved award of\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, and on his unprecedented early\nre-election to a second term. The renewal of Mr.\nAnnan\u2019s mandate by the international community\nreflects deep confidence in his character and\ncapabilities, in addition to recognition of his past\nrecord. We look forward to continuing to see him bring\ninto play his creative perspective in addressing a whole\narray of complete and interrelated issues facing our\nworld.\nMany of the questions and challenges facing our\ncountries nowadays involve implications and risks that\ncut across national borders of sovereign countries. It is\nlittle wonder that our world has become a smaller\nplanet where geographical boundaries, cultural\ndiversity, economic status and ethnic multiplicity have\nbecome lesser factors in shielding communities against\nglobal influences and, by the same token, have\nprovided larger platforms for interaction with others.\nThe fact that the world community is now seized with\nfighting terrorism is perhaps yet further compelling and\nclear evidence of the deep interaction among and\ncomplexity of States\u2019 interests and concerns. The\nstrong condemnation of the heinous terrorist acts\ncommitted against the United States of America on 11\nSeptember 2001 reflects the international community\u2019s\nrecognition that the real target of that assault is the\npolitical, economic and social stability of the world\norder. Indeed, those attacks affected, without\ndiscrimination, virtually all nation States, all\ncontinents, all civilizations, all religions and all races.\nKuwait, for its part, has had a long-standing and\nfirm position of total and unequivocal condemnation of\nterrorism, irrespective of its form or manifestation.\nThus, only hours after the commission of those\ncriminal acts, which contravene and violate every\nreligious concept and every cultural and humanitarian\nvalue system, the Government and people of Kuwait\ncondemned them. I wish to reiterate here our deep\nsympathies and condolences to the bereaved families\nand to the friendly people of the United States of\nAmerica. Let me reaffirm our full backing and support\nfor all the efforts and measures adopted by the\ninternational coalition to destroy the dens and bases of\nterrorism with a view to stamping out its roots, to\napprehend the perpetrators of these criminal acts and to\nbring them to justice. In this regard, we call for the\ncompletion of work on the development of a rigorous\ninternational legal system with which all countries of\nthe world would comply in good faith to eradicate this\nevil.\nIn compliance with Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), Kuwait has enacted specific measures to\nplug any loopholes that might be abused in charitable\nfund-raising activities and to ensure that any charity\nasset is used solely and exclusively for its original\n5\n\nlegitimate purposes. Our competent authorities are now\nin the process of taking further enforcement measures\nto ensure universal and strict compliance.\nAt a time when we condemn all acts of terrorism,\nwe have been truly surprised to hear some voices that\nhave started to mount intense and relentless campaigns\nlinking terrorism with Islam. Those allegations\nrepresent an obvious mistreatment of and injustice to a\ndivine faith revealed by God Almighty to humankind to\nensure mercy and compassion on this planet. Islam is a\nfaith that advocates peace, calls for tolerance, promotes\namity and renounces bigotry and extremism. Suffice it\nto cite one verse from The Holy Koran:\n\u201cInvite (all) to the Way\nOf thy Lord with wisdom\nAnd beautiful preaching\u201d (The Holy Koran,\nXVI:125)\nTherefore, we really cannot accept these tendencies in\nthe domestic or international mass media, regardless of\nany excuse or pretext. Indeed, it is our common\nresponsibility to challenge such pernicious campaigns\nin the interest of global social harmony.\nAn effective fight against terrorism requires\nmaximum international cooperation and coordination.\nIt also demands a soul-searching review of our\npolitical, economic and social policies and practices in\ndealing with current global challenges. The aim is to\ndeny evil-doers any reason to carry out their terror\nschemes to advance their own agendas.\nWhile we stress the importance and relevance of\nall United Nations resolutions and instruments relating\nto the suppression of terrorism, Kuwait endorses the\ncall to convene an international conference on\nterrorism. A key purpose of that proposed meeting\nwould be to set out a clear definition of terrorism that\ndraws a line between terrorism as a phenomenon that\nstrikes at international peace and security and the right\nof peoples to struggle against occupation with a view\nto achieving self-determination, in line with the Charter\nof the United Nations and the norms of international\nlaw.\nKuwait is in full sympathy with the friendly\npeople of Afghanistan, who have endured a great and\nsteady decline in their living conditions for over 20\nyears. The relentless conflicts and wars that have\nafflicted Afghanistan for too long have destroyed the\ninfrastructure and resources of that country. In response\nto the appeal of the Secretary-General seeking\nresources to meet the severe humanitarian crisis of the\nAfghan people, the Government of Kuwait has\nannounced a donation of $3 million in support of\ninternational humanitarian relief efforts. Three\nshipments of relief aid have also been sent to the\nAfghan refugees. These supplies are distributed in\ncoordination with the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. Furthermore, back\nin Kuwait, we are organizing a public fund-raising\ncampaign to solicit donations from individuals and\nprivate companies to alleviate the suffering of the\nAfghan people. The total yield of that effort now stands\nat over $8 million.\nWith regard to the overall situation in\nAfghanistan, Kuwait maintains that international\nefforts should be maximized to bring about the long-\nawaited peace and security. National reconciliation and\na national coalition Government, elected by the people\nof Afghanistan, that represent all factions and ethnic\ngroups are perhaps the most viable means to ensure the\nsustainability of the country and eventually its recovery\nof normal status within the region and the world. Only\nthen will the nation of Afghanistan be able to channel\nits energy and resources towards reconstruction and\ndevelopment.\nIn the meantime, while we express our deep\nregret for the civilian casualties among the Afghan\npopulation, we sincerely hope that the ongoing military\noperations against the bastions of terrorism and the\nterrorists will cause no injuries to innocent, unarmed\npeople who are totally powerless and helpless.\nKuwait views the environment as a key common\nheritage and destiny that must be preserved for future\ngenerations. The bitter recent experience of the Gulf\nregion, where two devastating wars took place, has left\nwide-scale environmental damage. Against this\nbackground, Kuwait sponsored a draft resolution\nsubmitted to the General Assembly to designate\n6 November of each year as the International Day for\nPreventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War\nand Armed Conflict. Kuwait is grateful that the\nresolution was adopted by consensus. It is our hope\nthat this initiative will help to further promote a deeper\nuniversal awareness of the need to safeguard our\nenvironment, which is the source of human life now\nand in the future.\n6\n\nThe eyes of the world have been fixed for over\none year now on the valiant uprising of the Palestinian\npeople, which arose as a natural and legitimate\nresponse to the continued Israeli occupation of the\nPalestinian territories and to the backtracking of the\nIsraeli Government from the accords it signed with the\nPalestinian side.\nThe obvious policy of the Government of Israel is\nto reject any Palestinian, regional or international\ninitiative. Instead, it counts as a matter of policy on the\nuse of force; state terrorism and the creation of faits\naccomplis on the ground. It slams every door that is\nopened, designs new oppressive measures and triggers\none crisis after another. Its overriding goal is to abort\nthe peace promise born in Madrid in 1991. Israel\u2019s\nbarbaric practices, its blatant challenge to all United\nNations resolutions and its excessive and unwarranted\nuse of lethal force in response to stone-throwing\nPalestinians have all combined to create an\noverwhelming sense of despair, frustration and gloom\nin the Palestinian ranks.\nHere one must ponder the hard lessons we have\nall learned from similar situations of unalloyed gloom\nand doom. It is precisely against this backdrop that the\nUnited Nations, the international community and the\nUnited States in particular, as a co-sponsor of the\nMiddle East peace process, must assume a special\ninternational responsibility to mount an effective and\nmeaningful drive to force Israel to fulfil its\nundertakings and commitments set forth in its bilateral\nagreements with the Palestinian Authority, as well as to\nimplement Security Council and General Assembly\nresolutions, including those relating to the city of\nJerusalem, with a view to preserving its Arab and\nIslamic character and its holy religious identity. Kuwait\ntherefore welcomes the indications of support by the\nUnited States for the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State. We hope that this declared position\nwill now be translated into concrete steps that will\nmove the whole peace process forward towards its\nlong-awaited outcome.\nIn this context, let me stress that Kuwait will\ncontinue to support our Palestinian brothers and to\nprovide all possible political and material assistance to\nthem until they attain all their legitimate political\nrights, including the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State on their own territory, with Jerusalem\nas its capital. In the same vein, Israel must\nunconditionally withdraw from the Syrian Arab Golan\nand the Lebanese Shab\u2019a farms.\nThe main objective of Kuwait\u2019s foreign policy is\nto consolidate security and stability throughout the\nArabian Gulf region. This goal will remain unmet\nunless and until Iraq implements all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. It is, indeed, regrettable that the\nGovernment of Iraq persists in its allegations that it has\ncarried out all its obligations under those resolutions.\nIn addition, that Government continues to pursue its\nlong-standing hostile practices and policies towards\nKuwait in order to heighten regional tension and to\ndestabilize security and peace. Kuwait has repeatedly\ndrawn the attention of the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General to the non-peaceful intentions of\nIraq, as exemplified by the recurrent threats made to\nKuwait\u2019s security and sovereignty by many high-level\nIraqi Government officials. Kuwait has also called on\nthe Security Council to bring pressure to bear on the\nIraqi Government so that it will honour all its\nobligations and thereby make it possible to lift the\nsanctions affecting the brotherly people of Iraq and to\npermit that country to reclaim its normal status as an\nactive member regionally and internationally.\nWhen we discuss here the suffering of children,\nwomen and the elderly, Kuwait cannot but recall its\nown excruciating experience, endured over the past\ndecade, relating to the question of Kuwaiti and third-\ncountry prisoners and hostages. In fact, this is a key\nobligation that Iraq has so far failed to fulfil. This issue\nremains a top national priority for the Government and\npeople of Kuwait.\nThe humanitarian nature of this long-running\nissue \u2014 the anguish that it is causing to the immediate\nfamilies of the prisoners and to our entire\npopulation \u2014 means that resolution of the problem\ncannot be delayed any longer. The Government of Iraq\nalone bears responsibility for the lack of any\nmeaningful progress in implementing the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. Those resolutions\ndemand, inter alia, that Iraq cooperate with the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the high-\nlevel Coordinator, Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, who\nwas appointed by the Secretary-General to facilitate the\nreturn of those prisoners and hostages. It is clear that\nthe Government of Iraq is insensitive to the\nhumanitarian dimension of this matter. This\ninsensitivity is borne out by its insistence on\nboycotting the meetings of the ad hoc Tripartite\n7\n\nCommission and its Technical Subcommittee since it\nwalked away from those meetings for unjustifiable\npolitical reasons in January 1999. Let me also reiterate\nour call to Iraq to return our stolen property, in\nparticular the State of Kuwait archives and other\nofficial documents.\nOver the past few years, the world economic\nscene has undergone remarkable changes. We have\nseen the emergence of several new economic\nphenomena created by the revolution in information\ntechnology and the immense scientific progress in\ncommunications and trade. These changes and\nphenomena have made it imperative for many\ncountries, especially the developing nations, to\nintroduce drastic changes to their economic plans and\nstructures in an attempt to benefit from the globalized\neconomy with a view to ensuring development and\nprogress for their societies. Despite the promise of\nsubstantial benefits as a result of policies to liberalize\nworld trade and eliminate customs barriers, we still\nhave to make a concerted effort in order to make the\nglobalization process a positive force that benefits all\nthe peoples of the world. This will require the drawing\nup of regional and international guidelines and\nstandards that protect the nascent economies of the\ndeveloping nations from economic turbulence and\ncrises that might otherwise have an adverse impact on\nthe living conditions of their peoples.\nIn the meantime, the developed countries and the\ninternational financial institutions should double their\nfinancial aid to the developing countries in order to\nenable them to strengthen the underpinnings of their\neconomic structures. In the long term, this will help to\nestablish more balanced economic relations built on\nmutual benefit and common interest. With that in mind,\nKuwait is pursuing a steadfast policy of support for\ndevelopmental projects in many developing countries.\nMost recently, Kuwait has contributed $1 million to the\nfund established by the Secretary-General to combat\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic.\nOn a parallel track, Kuwait is contributing to the\nfunding of many developmental programmes and\nprojects in the developing countries through\ninternational and regional financial institutions, as well\nas through many public Kuwaiti charitable\norganizations. This philanthropy is motivated by a\nsense of common social responsibility and social\ninterdependence \u2014 values that are embedded in the\ntraditions of our Islamic faith.\nLet me close by saying that we look forward to\nparticipating actively in the forthcoming celebrations\nof the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\nHopefully, this will turn out to be another event that\nunderscores our determination to promote and\nconsolidate the concepts of civilized tolerance and\nunderstanding among our nations and peoples, who all\nyearn to live free of self-inflicted conflicts and to enjoy\na prosperous life in which good and virtuous human\ntendencies prevail as a basis for international relations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe fifty-sixth session\nof the General Assembly is no ordinary one. We are\nmeeting in the aftermath of the despicable terrorist\nattacks on New York, the seat of the United Nations,\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. Once again, we\nexpress our deep condolences to the Government and\nthe people of the United States. Our thoughts go out to\nthe families of those who lost their loved ones in those\ntragic and horrific events of 11 September. Namibia\nreiterates its unreserved condemnation of these and all\nother terrorist attacks, wherever they occur.\nIn the same vein, we express our condolences to\nthe families of those who perished in the American\nAirlines accident on 12 November. We also convey our\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\nDominican Republic.\nNamibia also expresses its heartfelt sympathy to\nthe Government and the people of Algeria as they\nmourn the deaths of those killed by the violent storm\nand mudslides there. Our thoughts go out to their\nfamilies.\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo\non his unanimous election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session and to assure him of\nNamibia\u2019s cooperation during his tenure. I would also\nlike to congratulate his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the skills he brought to the work\nof the General Assembly while presiding over the fifty-\nfifth session. Under his able leadership, we have made\na firm beginning to the implementation of the\nDeclaration of the Millennium Summit.\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the\nUnited Nations have earned a place among the Nobel\nPeace Prize laureates. For this, as well as for his\nunanimous, early re-election, Namibia extends warm\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General. This, indeed,\nis eloquent testimony to the universal respect and\nadmiration he has earned from all Member States. We\nwish him well and assure him of our full support\nduring his new term of office.\n29\n\nToday we face multiple challenges, some of\nwhich threaten the future existence of communities and\nnations. With the adoption of the historic Millennium\nDeclaration, world leaders pledged their determination\nto address old as well as new obstacles hampering\npeace and security. A solemn commitment has thus\nbeen made to enhance social and economic prosperity\nfor all people, thereby ensuring a better world.\nThrough the United Nations, and with strong\npolitical will, no challenge is insurmountable. The\nUnited Nations is the only international body capable\nof serving the interests of all nations. It is an effective\nconsultative and organizational forum for world affairs,\nand it can create trust and confidence among nations. It\ncan bring peace to war-torn areas and bring relief and\ndevelopment to people who need it most. When\nsufficiently funded, its programmes and mandates can\nhelp developing countries to meet the challenges of\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases threatening our\npopulations.\nIt is therefore important that we, the Member\nStates, reaffirm our commitment to continue to\nstrengthen our Organization in order to effectively\naddress the challenges of the new millennium. In this\ncontext, we reiterate our call for the reform and\ndemocratization of the Security Council. The Security\nCouncil must be transparent and equitably\nrepresentative. Above all, it must be responsive and\naccountable to all States Members, on whose behalf it\nmaintains international peace and security.\nThe outcome of the historic first Conference on\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects, held in July 2001, marked an important\nfirst step and set achievable goals to address the\nproblems associated with this scourge, at all levels. It\nwill now require the combined efforts of the United\nNations, Member States and relevant international and\nregional organizations to ensure that rapid progress is\nmade to stop the proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons, which has wreaked havoc, especially on the\nAfrican continent.\nTerrorism has assumed an increasingly alarming\nglobalized character. For some time now, the\nMovement of the Non-Aligned Countries has been\ncalling for an international conference against\nterrorism. The time is now right for Member States to\nreach a consensus on such a conference. In this respect,\nI wish to point out that Namibia signed, on 10\nNovember 2001, the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and we call\non others to do likewise.\nAt the 1990 World Summit for Children we made\na collective commitment to put children first, take care\nof and educate them and protect them from harm,\nexploitation, war and abuse. Yet too many children in\ntoo many parts of the world are still deprived of a\npeaceful childhood. Let us seize the occasion of the\ntwenty-seventh special session of the General\nAssembly, on children, to take effective measures to\nmake the world fit for all our children.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached\ncatastrophic proportions. The Secretary-General\nreminded us that nearly 22 million people have died of\nHIV/AIDS and that out of more than 36 million people\ninfected worldwide by HIV/AIDS, 25.3 million live in\nsub-Saharan Africa. Thus, if indeed we are to succeed\nin reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, as world\nleaders committed themselves to doing in so many\nforums, then Governments, civil society and the private\nsector must, in strong partnership, tackle HIV/AIDS. In\nthis connection, the establishment of the Global AIDS\nand Health Fund to combat the AIDS epidemic and\nother communicable diseases is a welcome initiative\nwhich calls for generous contributions.\nThe World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,\nheld in Durban, South Africa, was the beginning of a\nprocess undertaken by the international community to\naddress the inhuman and brutal treatment of the victims\nof the dehumanizing practice of slavery and\ncolonialism, especially the African people. The trans-\nAtlantic slave trade and the colonization of the African\npeoples remain the darkest and most humiliating\nepisode in the history of the African continent. The\nhealing process will be enhanced only if and when\nthose who committed and benefited from slavery and\ncolonialism accept their full responsibility.\nNamibia applauds the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), designed to bring\nto justice those individuals accused of the most serious\ncrimes of concern to the international community.\nRecently, the Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) adopted the Windhoek Plan of\nAction on ICC Ratification and Implementation,\ndesigned to promote early ratification of the ICC treaty.\n30\n\nNamibia is currently reviewing its national legislation\nto prepare for the ratification of the treaty.\nThe knowledge-based global economy has\nrevolutionized the nature of trade, finance,\nemployment, migration, the environment and social\nsystems, as well as the concept and application of\ngovernance.\nNamibia, like other countries of the South,\nexpects tangible results from the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Mexico. It is in the interest of North-South\nand South-South cooperation that additional options be\nexplored to mobilize financing for development.\nSimilarly, the fourth Ministerial Meeting of the World\nTrade Organization, in Doha, Qatar, could pave the\nway to an equitable international trading system that is\nmutually beneficial to all countries, provided that\npolitical will prevails.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nto be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, next year\nshould galvanize momentum for the full\nimplementation of Agenda 21, in particular the\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.\nDesertification, land erosion and land degradation\nshould be given due and appropriate consideration.\nAfrica has recently taken an important step\ntowards greater unity and cohesion with the\ntransformation of the Organization of African Unity\ninto the African Union. This momentous step would\nbring about closer integration of the continent and\nwould make Africa more competitive in an\nincreasingly global market. Furthermore, the heads of\nState and Government adopted the New African\nInitiative, now the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment, whose primary objective is the\neradication of poverty through sustained economic\ngrowth and sustainable development. We call on the\ninternational community to support and assist African\ncountries in the implementation of this New\nPartnership.\nLet me stress that the initiatives undertaken by\nJapan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the United\nStates, under the third Tokyo International Conference\non African Development, the China-Africa Forum and\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act respectively\ncan complement the efforts of African countries for\nsustained economic growth.\nWe congratulate the people of East Timor on their\nstruggle for independence and on conducting\nsuccessful elections for their first Constituent\nAssembly. We commend the United Nations for its\nimportant role in East Timor. We wish the people of\nEast Timor every success in the reconstruction and\nrehabilitation of their country. We call on the\ninternational community to be generous in its support\nof the East Timorese people in this most challenging\nphase of their nationhood.\nThe eleventh of November this year marks 26\nyears of the independence of the Republic of Angola.\nBut for more than a quarter of a century, the people of\nAngola have endured a brutal and devastating war.\nThey have suffered horrendous terrorist attacks against\ncivilian targets, including most recently attacks on a\npassenger train, on school buses, the kidnapping of\nschoolchildren, attacks on hospitals and the wanton\ndestruction of infrastructure; all at the hands of\nUNITA. Tens of thousands of innocent men, women\nand children have been killed. Their agricultural fields\nare infested with landmines. Angola has acquired the\ndubious distinction of having the largest number of\namputees and the greatest number of landmines. This is\nnot right; it cannot be right. These heinous atrocities\ncommitted by UNITA, as well as that group\u2019s\nconsistent record of duplicity and always negotiating in\nbad faith, compelled SADC, in 1998, to declare\nSavimbi, UNITA\u2019s leader, a war criminal.\nFor its part, having determined convincingly that\nUNITA is responsible for the violations of the Lusaka\nProtocol and the resumption of the war, the United\nNations Security Council imposed sanctions against\nUNITA. While sanctions have been effective in many\nimportant respects, more concrete measures need to be\ntaken by Member States to strengthen them and make\nthem even more effective. African countries have a\nbigger and special obligation in this regard. Sanctions\nmust be tightened in those areas identified by the\nMonitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA,\nsuch as the freezing of UNITA assets and bank\naccounts and the closing down of UNITA\nrepresentations abroad, which now operate under\nmisleading and innocuous sounding appellations but\nwhich in fact continue to promote UNITA activities\nand advocate its wicked cause. The international\ncommunity should respond more decisively to repeated\ndefiance of Security Council resolutions by UNITA. By\nacting more resolutely against UNITA, the\n31\n\ninternational community will help end the prolonged\nsuffering, tears and agony of the people of Angola.\nRegarding the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Namibia is encouraged by the progress made in\nthe implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement. The ceasefire has been holding so far\ndespite some violations and infringements, particularly\nin the eastern part of the country. The continued\noccupation by forces of aggression has created\ndeplorable human suffering and large-scale human\nrights violations in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Namibia, once again wishes to remind the\nMembers of the United Nations that a cardinal\nprinciple of the Charter of this Organization has been\nviolated with impunity, when some of its Members\ncommitted an act of naked aggression against the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is even more\ndeplorable when the aggressor countries are engaged in\nthe ruthless exploitation and plundering of the natural\nresources of the Congo. We reiterate here that\naggression should be rejected and condemned\nwhenever and wherever it occurs. There should be no\ndouble standards when it comes to the violation of the\nprinciples of the Charter with regard to aggression. The\ninternational community should also assist the people\nof the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\ntheir country.\nNow it is time for the Security Council to\nimplement its decisions without further delay and\napprove the personnel for phase III of the deployment\nof the United Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), taking\nfully into account the demands and requirements of\nthat peacekeeping operation \u2014 the size of the country\nand the non-existence of the infrastructure. The United\nNations and the international community cannot fail\nthe people of the Congo this time around.\nWe are gratified by the increased efforts of the\nSecurity Council and the serious attention paid by the\ninternational community to Sierra Leone, which have\nnow started to pay off. The international community\nshould remain actively engaged and continue to assist\nwith the peace-building and reconstruction of the\npeace-loving people of Sierra Leone.\nHistory teaches us that no administrative Power\nhas relinquished authority as a gesture of good will,\nthat no peace process has been problem-free and that\nparties to a conflict, naturally, will have differences.\nThis notwithstanding, however, no amount of\ndifficulties can justify abandonment of the United\nNations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara. Any\nattempt to legitimize, in whatever form or shape, the\npresent situation in Western Sahara is unjustifiable and\nis a departure from the United Nations Declaration on\ndecolonization and relevant General Assembly and\nSecurity Council resolutions. Ignoring the legitimate\naspirations of the brave Sahrawi people will only delay\ndurable peace in the region. A departure from the\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan will deny the Sahrawi\npeople their inalienable right to self-determination and\nindependence. Namibia will reject and will dissociate\nitself from any plan, informal or otherwise, to deny the\nSahrawi people their legitimate right to express\nthemselves through a free, fair and impartial\nreferendum for self-determination.\nNo people can maintain peace and security or\nbuild its prosperity on the helplessness and abject\nmisery of others, particularly their neighbours. The\npeople of Palestine and, indeed, the international\ncommunity are crying out for the establishment of the\nPalestinian State. They are crying out for peace\nbetween Palestine and the State of Israel. It is now time\nto heed this call. The legitimate right of the people of\nPalestine to self-determination and the establishment of\nan independent State of their own cannot be denied and\ncannot be compromised. A Palestinian State will be in\nthe best interests of Israel, of security and peace, of the\nentire Middle East and of the whole world. The basis\nfor a just and lasting peace in the Middle East remains\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973).\nLet us make sustained and determined collective\nefforts to promote peace and development in all corners\nof the world, so that our children and grandchildren can\nlive in a peaceful world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, Sir, I would\nlike to congratulate you on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. I would also like\nto express my appreciation for the wise and persistent\nefforts of the Secretary-General during the current\ncrucial world situation.\nHuman society stepped into the third millennium\nwith hopes and expectations. The United Nations\ndesignated the last year of the twentieth century as the\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and the first\nyear of the twenty-first century as the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. Today, however,\nthe world faces immense tragedies and grave concerns.\nOne of the most brutal and savage manifestations of\nthis was the terrorist attack against the American\npeople.\nThe decisive, immediate and unequivocal global\ncondemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 September\nrepresents the emergence of a public attitude and\ncommon political will all over the world to counter\nterrorism in all its manifestations, irrespective of\nmotives, perpetrators or victims. The Leader of the\nIslamic Revolution of Iran spoke of the \u201cjihad against\nthis evil phenomenon\u201d so as to highlight the genuine\nview of Islam and the Islamic Revolution vis-\u00e0-vis\nterrorism and violence.\nImmediately after the carnage of 11 September,\nand in the name of the people and Government of the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, I expressed sympathy with\n29\n\nthe American nation and all the victims of that criminal\nact. And in the first days of the tragedy, in a letter to\nthe Secretary-General, I underlined that,\n\u201cTerrorism is the common problem of today\u2019s\nworld. It threatens peace, liberty, spirituality,\nknowledge, culture and global coexistence. A\nsustainable solution to this hideous and dangerous\nphenomenon requires vision, serious political will\nand active participation and cooperation of all\nmembers of the human society.\u201d\nThe threat of terrorism should not be\nunderestimated, nor should its devastating\nconsequences be measured only in the visible realm of\npolitics. Terrorism is the chronic menace of our era,\nrooted in the mentality of violence, the logic of might\nand the practice of injustice and discrimination. When\nspirituality, ethics and justice find no room in the\nrealms of politics, economics and culture, and when\ndiscrimination, marginalization, exclusion and the\napplication of double standards push justice aside, the\nworld is bound to face alienation, despair, extremism\nand lawlessness. In such a climate, terrorism finds\nfertile ground for growth.\nThe disaster in the United States is so tragic and\ngrave that thinkers are urgently called on to engage in\ndeep reflection and dialogue on its real causes. For\nmany years, our great thinkers have cautioned us to\navoid submission to instrumental reasoning, warning of\nthe threats and tragedies that it could generate.\nOn the other hand, some of the great thinkers of\nour time have ascribed atrocities such as fascism to the\nreign of mythological speculation. They have attributed\nthe emergence of fascism not to the expansion of\nrationality but to evading rationality and succumbing to\nthe reign of myth.\nThis does not mean that we will succumb to\nmythical speculation if we do not want to. We have the\nchoice not to negate rationality. But at the same time,\nwe must also combine rationality with empathy, the\nmind with the heart. Neither one can be without the\nother. Neither one can be neglected. If it is, it will lead\nto tragedy, no matter under what pretext, religion, race,\nnationalism or any other nation. The same mythical\nspeculation is seen in modern cult ideology, which is a\nform of rationality that is reduced to instrumental\nreasoning and thereby stripped of all its moral and\nhuman aspects. Religion, tradition, philosophy and art\ndescend to achieving only one goal, that of political\nends.\nOne of the most common features of these\nideologies, which is regrettably prevalent, is the\nglorification of the self and the demonization of\nopposing groups and ideas. The advocates of this\nideology in the West attribute to Islam, the religion of\nhumanity, compassion and justice, such labels as\nterrorism. In the same manner, in parts of the Islamic\nworld, the West is equated with suppression. Such\npolarization of the world and human beings would lead\nto horrifying political and security consequences for\nthe whole world.\nThe world has yet to overcome the horror and\ndisbelief caused by the malicious terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember against thousands of innocent people. At the\nsame time, the most destructive modern weapons are\nbeing used in one of the most deprived parts of the\nworld against an oppressed and dispossessed people.\nOnce again, history repeats its sad experience that war\ntriggers war.\nThe time is ripe for us to analyse the history and\nconsequences of exclusionary ways of acting, to\ninitiate ways to engage intellectuals from different\ncultures in dialogue and to encourage the public to\nembark upon learning for the sake of dialogue and\ndialogue for the sake of learning and to reinforce the\nart of listening as sacred and invaluable.\nAngry politicians should be prevented from\ntaking the initiative in ongoing developments. They\nshould be made to yield to the judgement of wisdom\nand fairness.\nThe American nation has experienced one of the\nmost brutal forms of terrorism, in which the blind\nhatred of terrorists has prevented the recovery of the\nbodies of the victims of the 11 September tragedy.\nToday, other nations walk hand in hand with the\nAmerican nation.\nToday, beyond mere rhetoric, one can see the\nconvergence of the ideas of the peoples of the United\nStates and Iran, who have also experienced, in earlier\ntimes, the mute but brutal massacre resulting from the\nuse of chemical weapons. This convergence of ideas\ncan also be discerned among all those refugees and\ndisplaced persons who are victims of war, suppression\nand terrorism \u2014 including State and non-State\nterrorism \u2014 in Afghanistan and Palestine.\n30\n\nWe must have empathy for the suffering of people\neverywhere: in occupied Palestine, oppressed\nAfghanistan, New York, Washington or any corner of\nthe globe.\nWe shall rise to the challenge of promoting peace,\nsecurity and development among all nations on the\nbasis of justice, and we believe that in today\u2019s\ninterconnected world, we cannot live in islands of\nprosperity and progress while the rest of the world\nsuffers from increasing poverty, illiteracy, disease and\ninsecurity. Acquiescing to any act of terrorism,\nanywhere in the world, is inconsistent with any\nreligious or ethical principle. Likewise, resorting to\nviolence and revenge to counter such acts could hardly\nbe justified because of ethical and humane\nconsiderations. Lacing the sacred realm of religion\nwith violence and terror is a grave disservice to all\nreligions and their followers. The divine religions call\nfor peace, tolerance and compassion. They\nunequivocally repudiate \u2014 in essence and appearance\n\u2014 any thought or act of violence. I would like to quote\nthe late leader of the Islamic revolution, Imam\nKhomeini, who said that \u201cas followers of Islam, we\nalways oppose war and desire peace and tranquillity\namong all States.\u201d\nLet us accept that no country in the world is\nimmune to terrorism. We should therefore seek\nsolutions at the highest possible level.\nToday there is unprecedented momentum in the\nworld for combating terrorism, which should not be\nlost. To this end, the United Nations can arrange and\nguide a genuine and legitimate endeavour in the\ninternational fight against terrorism. The Islamic\nRepublic of Iran is an active partner in this global\ncoalition and spares no effort for the success of the\ninternational community in uprooting terrorism through\nviable, just and non-discriminatory measures. By\narticulating a comprehensive definition of terrorism,\nthe United Nations can overcome one of the major\nhistorical hurdles to avoiding further misuse of that\nterm. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001) and its effective implementation by all States\ncan be considered a first step for a coordinated\ninternational campaign against terrorism. Moreover,\nnegotiations on the draft comprehensive convention on\nterrorism, based on internationally accepted definitions\nand principles, would provide an effective basis for\ncollective measures in this respect.\nThe 11 September attack indicated that the\ndivision between centre and periphery can no longer\ndefine the security order of the world today, for even\nthe most marginalized sectors might be able to inflict\nblows on the biggest Powers. This development has\ntaken on all the more threatening dimensions in the\nlight of the emergence of the dangerous phenomenon\nof bioterrorism.\nThe conflict-stricken regions of the world require\nurgent and comprehensive attention. After decades of\nwar, insecurity and destruction, Afghanistan needs\norder, law, security and stability. The ongoing military\noperation in Afghanistan cannot, while inflicting\ndestruction and casualties, address the root causes of\nthe kind of terrorism that has been forced on the\ndefenceless people of that country. On the contrary: it\nis more likely that the continuation of the current\nmilitary approach could incite sentiments that intensify\nintolerance and violence in the region and the whole\nworld.\nIn the midst of the global terrorism crisis, the\nworld faces an intensive and severe kind of terrorism in\nthe Middle East. The occupation of the Palestinian\nterritories, the expulsion of the Palestinian people from\ntheir homeland, the Judaization of Palestine \u2014 in\nparticular Al-Quds Al-Sharif \u2014 the building of illegal\nsettlements, the killing and terrorizing of defenceless\nPalestinian civilians in their homeland, and the\ndestruction of historical sites, civil institutions and\nresidential areas are all examples of this phenomenon.\nI would also like to underscore, on behalf of the\nGroup of 77, the significance of poverty alleviation\nworldwide and the need for the support of the United\nNations. Poverty breeds violence and intolerance. The\nrecent slowdown in world economic growth and\ndevelopment caused by the terrorist attacks further\naggravates the economic hardships of the developing\ncountries.\nFor a secure and hopeful life, the world therefore\nneeds innovative approaches and collective measures.\nLet us therefore build a coalition for peace instead of\nwar and hostility. The initiative of dialogue among\ncivilizations is a step in this direction, and it offers a\nnew paradigm of interaction among nations and\ncultures in a world that longs for peace and security.\nCan the United Nations take the lead in devising\na programme to implement this fair and reasonable\napproach and become the focus of a global coalition for\n31\n\npeace based on justice? I have every confidence in the\nwisdom and the will of the Secretary-General \u2014\nillustrated, inter alia, by the publication of a book,\nentitled Crossing the Divide \u2014 to define a new\nparadigm of dialogue among civilizations. World\npublic opinion is supportive of this proposal. The\nadoption of the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\nCivilizations yesterday represents a beginning for the\ncrystallization of this common desire and will of the\nglobal community.\nThe achievements of the thirty-first United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) General Conference in\nestablishing dialogue among civilizations as one of its\nstrategic objectives and in adopting the Universal\nDeclaration on Cultural Diversity represent yet another\nserious indication of this global trend, and I wish to\npay tribute to UNESCO and its Director-General. Will\npoliticians and statesmen also submit to this approach,\nto prevent the transformation of the clash among States\ninto a clash among civilizations? I am hopeful; the\nfuture will be the judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPending\nfurther news, I also wish to share in the sadness we all\nfeel on the announcement of an aeroplane crash in\nQueens.\nThrough me, Senegal has the pleasure of\naddressing its warm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo on his brilliant election to the presidency of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nHis election clearly is a tribute to his outstanding\nqualities as a diplomat and statesman and it also\nexpresses the unanimous recognition of the Member\nStates of our Organization of his country, the Republic\nof Korea, for its steadfast commitment to the service of\nuniversal peace and international cooperation.\nI wish to express to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, our deep\ngratitude for the competence, commitment and spirit of\nopenness with which he discharged his mandate during\na particularly heavy year.\nFinally, I am happy to reiterate Senegal\u2019s deep\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, and at the same time to reiterate to\nhim our wholehearted compliments on his historic re-\nelection, the dazzling consecration of outstanding\nqualities of a man of good will, conviction and vision,\nwho has devoted his life to the noble causes of the\nUnited Nations. I also congratulate him on the brilliant\nrecognition he and the United Nations have just\nreceived as the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.\nHe deserves our full support in the pursuit and the\nachievement of the outstanding work in the area of\nreform in which he, along with his colleagues, is fully\ninvested to bring our Organization closer to the\nrealities of the twenty-first century.\nThe terrorist attempts of 11 September, which\ntragically struck New York, the Headquarters of our\nOrganization, Washington and Pennsylvania, have\nradically changed our vision of the world and of\ninternational relations. My country, Senegal, once\nagain conveys its sympathy to the people of the United\nStates and reiterates its heartfelt condolences to the\nbereaved families.\nLet us say it unambiguously: there is no moral,\nreligious or political cause noble enough to justify\n17\n\nterrorism or its always barbarous manifestations \u2014\nwhich all of us without exception must condemn with\nunwavering unity and with the utmost force.\nSenegal is a secular democratic country whose\npopulation is more than 90 per cent Muslim; we reject\nall forms of confrontation between religions, cultures\nor civilizations. Senegal believes that Islam, like other\nrevealed religions, is a faith of peace and tolerance, and\nvigorously condemns any equation of Islam with\nterrorism and any attempt to invoke or use religion for\ncriminal purposes. The massacre of pregnant women\nand the destruction of buildings occupied by innocent\ncivilians \u2014 God\u2019s creatures every one \u2014 are acts that\nhave no justification in any religion, least of all Islam,\nwhose banner of peace and harmony among men and\nwomen, peoples, cultures and civilizations we proudly\nbear.\nBeyond simply condemning terrorism in all its\nforms, methods and manifestations, the international\ncommunity must act firmly to eradicate terrorism, its\nsources of financing and its bases of action throughout\nthe world.\nSenegal is committed to that course, which is why\nHis Excellency President Abdoulaye Wade took the\nwell known initiative of convening on 17 October at\nDakar an African conference against terrorism, in\nwhich 27 countries participated. President Wade\nsubmitted to that forum a draft African pact against\nterrorism as a needed complement to the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention\nand Combating of Terrorism. The conference ended\nwith the adoption of the Dakar Declaration against\nTerrorism, which firmly condemned terrorism in all its\nforms; reaffirmed our solidarity with all victims of\nterrorist acts, in particular the thousands of innocent\ncivilian citizens of countries throughout the world who\ndied on 11 September; and invited the OAU promptly\nto convene an extraordinary session on terrorism to\nconsider, inter alia, the draft African pact against\nterrorism submitted by Senegal with the support of\nother countries.\nLet me make it clear that those who argue that\nAfrica has priorities other than terrorism are surely\nforgetting that tragedy resulting from acts of blind\nslaughter struck first in Africa: in Kenya and Tanzania.\nWith bald lack of consideration and respect for African\nlives, bombers in Nairobi killed 12 United States\nnationals and 212 Kenyans and wounded more than\n3,000 of our Kenyan brothers and sisters. They have\nnever expressed any regret, much less remorse, for\ntheir obvious contempt for us. Fighting international\nterrorism means saying loud and clear that Africans,\nlike Europeans, Americans and all the other peoples of\nthe world, have an equal right to safety, security,\nstability and peace.\nThat is the powerful message that His Excellency\nPresident Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal wants to echo\nthroughout the world. Let us remember his initiative\nfor a genuine security policy in Africa, along with his\ninitiative to review African debt and his Omega\nPlan \u2014 a genuine African globalization strategy which\nhas now been merged with the Millennium Partnership\nfor African Recovery to form the New African\nInitiative.\nThere are years that the long march of history\ncannot conceal or obliterate, and the past 12-month\nperiod is undoubtedly among these; it was\nextraordinarily rich in events of great importance both\nfor the United Nations and for Africa, the seat of\nhumankind. Thus, within the framework of the fifty-\nfifth session, the Millennium Summit brought together\nin this Hall heads of State or Government to, in the\nfelicitous words of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, identify and work to solve the world\u2019s major\nproblems.\nIn an extraordinary convergence of views, world\nleaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations and\nits irreplaceable mission to protect international peace\nand security, to fight poverty, to promote economic and\nsocial development, to strengthen democracy and the\nrule of law and to ensure justice and equity among\ncitizens, peoples, cultures and civilizations.\nIn view of the universality which is the hallmark\nof the United Nations and which was reaffirmed at the\nMillennium Summit, Senegal firmly supports the\nlegitimate request of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nto resume its seat in the Organization and in its\nspecialized agencies. That request is not directed\nagainst any State Member of the United Nations; meeting\nit would be a key contribution to consolidating the\nideal of the universality of the United Nations and to\nthe advent of an era of peace and stability in that\nsensitive part of the world.\nAfrica remains the region where some conflicts\nseem to exist in tragic eternity; it is where nearly half\nof the world\u2019s refugees and displaced persons are to be\n18\n\nfound; it is the site of 33 of the world\u2019s 48 least\ndeveloped countries. Africa is also the region whose\ninhabitants are the most appallingly affected by the\nHIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics. Unquestionably,\nthat enormously disturbing situation calls out to the\nentire international community and, in particular, to\nAfricans. That is why it is important to implement the\noutcome of the twenty-sixth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, which was devoted to the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\nLast July, the African Union was christened at the\nhistoric Lusaka summit of the OAU. By that historic\nact, Africa committed itself, in a proactive and unified\nspirit, to find African solutions to the many challenges\nbefore it, by establishing a modern, viable, open\ninstitutional framework that can respond to Africa\u2019s\nemergencies and needs in the new century. Here, I\nrenew my congratulations to my friend and brother\nAmara Essy, to whom African heads of State or\nGovernment have entrusted the task of following Salim\nAhmed Salim in shouldering the high responsibilities\nof the post of Secretary-General of the OAU and of\nputting in place the new structures of the African\nUnion.\nThe second major event of the Lusaka summit is\npart of the same pan-African dynamic: the adoption of\na plan for the economic and social development of\nAfrica, known as the New African Initiative \u2014 the new\npartnership for the development of Africa, to which I\nearlier referred. This has the quality of having been\nconceived by Africans for Africa on the basis of the\nmerger of two novel projects: the Omega Plan of\nPresident Abdoulaye Wade; and the programme for an\nAfrican renaissance of Presidents Thabo Mbeki of\nSouth Africa, Abelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and\nOlusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. That joint initiative\nshould help create the synergy needed to eradicate\npoverty in Africa and to lay the foundations for\nsustainable economic and social development, which is\na prerequisite for integrating the continent into the\nongoing process of globalization.\nFor the first time in the history of plans for the\nrenewal of Africa, an international conference on the\nfinancing of the New African Initiative is planned for\nJanuary 2002 at Dakar. That forum will truly be an\nAfrican Davos and should make it possible to hold a\nfruitful dialogue among all development partners that\nhave understood the renewal heralded by the new plan,\nwhich sums up our experiences and symbolizes the\nhopes of all of us who unconditionally love Africa.\nThere has been impressive progress in Africa this\nyear with respect to the urgent need to tackle the root\ncauses of the many conflicts that shake the continent\nand to work peacefully towards their lasting resolution.\nOn the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nin Burundi and in Sierra Leone, we are pleased to say\nthat significant milestones have been reached by all\nactors in the implementation of peace agreements\nalready concluded.\nFrom that standpoint, there is true cause for\nencouragement in the beginning of an inter-Congolese\ndialogue in Gaborone, Botswana, and the recent\nformation, with the help of the incomparable Nelson\nMandela, of the transitional government of Burundi for\nnational reconciliation. It is now up to the Security\nCouncil to perform all of its responsibilities under\nChapter VII of the Charter. These efforts deserve to be\nintensified and given diplomatic support by the\ninternational community through concrete actions to\nfinance strategies for post-conflict peace-building. In\nthe same spirit, it is important to support the efforts of\nAngola and the Organization of African Unity for the\nrapid settlement of the conflict in that country.\nIn light of the debt crisis aggravated by the\nexponential drop in official development assistance, the\ninternational community must explore new ways and\nmeans to develop the third world, especially Africa,\nthrough, inter alia, an increase in direct foreign\ninvestment. It is this break with the past \u2014 this\n\u201cepistemological\u201d departure \u2014 that our President\nproposes to Africa and its partners. He argues that the\naid/credit couplet, which has been the principal way to\nfinance development in Africa and has led to the\nimpasse we all know, should be abandoned and\nreplaced by an approach that makes Africa attractive\nand competitive, leading to a massive inflow of private\ninvestment, both domestic and international.\nThe cycle of debt followed by ever greater\ndebt \u2014 a cycle that has been described by our\nPresident as a scourge similar to the slavery that\ndevastated Africa \u2014 should give way to an approach\nthat brings in massive investment in an adequate fiscal\nand legal environment \u2014 investment capable of filling\nthe gaps in priority sectors such as infrastructure,\neducation, health, agriculture, new technologies and\naccess to the markets of developed countries. This\n19\n\napproach, of course, would be part of a strategy of\ngood political and economic governance and\nunqualified respect for the rule of law, democracy and\nhuman rights.\nAfrica is relying greatly on the results of the\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization that just opened in Doha; the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment in Monterrey, scheduled for March 2002;\nand the World Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg, planned for September, to provide\ninnovative solutions to the challenges besetting Africa\nat the beginning of this millennium.\nLooking sadly toward the Middle East, Senegal is\nfollowing recent developments with great concern and\nfeels solidarity with the Palestinian people in light of\nthe new tragedy. Horrified by the scope of this tragedy,\nSenegal condemns the Israeli occupation of Palestinian\nterritories and the intensification of acts of violence\nagainst innocent civilians. Senegal addresses an earnest\nappeal to all the parties, the co-sponsors of the peace\nprocess, the European Union, the Security Council and\nthe international community, for the withdrawal of\nIsraeli forces from the occupied Palestinian areas; for\nthe immediate cessation of all acts of violence and\nprovocation; for respect for the Geneva Convention\nRelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time\nof War and the relevant United Nations resolutions; for\nthe resumption of peace negotiations in accordance\nwith the agreed timetable; and for the conclusion of an\noverall settlement agreement that is just, durable and in\nconformity with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\nof the Security Council.\nPeace cannot prosper nor can the development of\nthe region be ensured so long as Israelis and\nPalestinians fail in their efforts to forge bonds of\nconfidence, as sovereign States within internationally\nrecognized and guaranteed borders. I am happy to note\nthat the European Union and the United States have\nrecently affirmed this, inasmuch as Israel and the\nfuture State of Palestine each have the right to exist, to\nlive in peace and to develop in security and dignity.\nI wish to conclude by saying that the\nconsolidation of the rule of law and the promotion and\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\nremain one of the major focal points of our national\nand foreign policy. The special importance that our\nPresident attaches to these matters has been eloquently\nexpressed in the appointment of a woman to the post of\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nwas held, despite all obstacles, and dealt with its\nagenda despite the complexity of the issues and the\nparticularly difficult conditions under which the\nnegotiations took place. My country, which had the\nhonour to preside over the work of the Preparatory\nCommittee, once again addresses a solemn appeal to all\nactors in international life to translate the Declaration\nand Plan of Action adopted at Durban into action.\nThus, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the\nworld can be definitively freed of the scourge of\nracism, which represents a grave infringement of\nhuman dignity and a flagrant violation of human rights.\nSpeaking of human rights, we also naturally think\nof the rights of women and children. The twenty-\nseventh special session of the General Assembly,\nplanned for 8-10 May 2002, will adopt a new agenda\nfor the international community aimed at better\nensuring, safeguarding and defending the rights of the\nchild and promoting the Convention on that subject.\nThe commitments to which our Governments will\nsubscribe must be implemented, as must the\nconclusions of the Fourth World Youth Forum of the\nUnited Nations system, held in Senegal in August this\nyear.\nIt is imperative that we face the challenges of\npeace and development. We have no other choice but to\ndo so through multilateralism and universalism. Thus\nthe world needs the United Nations, an organization\nthat is universal and unique. This is the conviction of\nSenegal, which proclaims that a United Nations that is\nwell restructured and more representative would be\nbetter equipped to face the challenges that humanity\nconfronts today. Those challenges seem as immovable\nas mountains, but everything is possible in a world of\nsolidarity, brotherhood, security and respect for the\nsacred character of human life, dignity and the\ninalienable right of all peoples to happiness and liberty.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffRecent events have\nmanifestly brought to the fore the importance and\nrelevance of the United Nations in the pursuit of global\npeace, security and stability. Only last year in this\nhistoric Hall, world leaders at the Millennium Summit\nreaffirmed their solemn commitment to strengthen the\ncapacity of the Organization in this very important\narea. Yet, two months ago, on 11 September 2001, the\nefforts of our Organization were temporarily called into\nquestion by terrorist attacks on the United States.\nAs a country which was directly affected by the\nfirst terrorist bombings in Dar es Salaam in 1998, in\nwhich our embassy building was destroyed, and\nbecause we lost nationals at the attack on the World\nTrade Center, Nigeria fully identifies with the rage and\ngrief of the bereaved families and the victims of these\nbarbaric acts.\nTerrorism is a global menace that challenges the\nvery basis of our civilization. It must therefore be\nconfronted globally. That is why Nigeria fully endorses\nthe prompt action taken by the General Assembly in\ncondemning these attacks. We fully support Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), because the measures\ncalled for in the resolution would significantly reduce\nthe capacity of terrorists to carry out such acts. Nigeria\nis committed to the implementation of the resolution\u2019s\nprovisions. Let us sustain the unity of purpose and\nresolve that the terrorist attacks have generated by\nstrengthening the cooperation and coordination among\nour countries. The terrorists and their supporters should\nbe exposed for what they are: fringe elements\nundeserving of a respectable place in the comity of\nnations. Our strategies therefore should be informed,\nconsistent and focused.\nIn some respects, the grave challenges that we\nface today also offer new possibilities for cooperation\npreviously unimaginable. Our Organization has not\nonly pursued the goal of international peace and\nsecurity, but it has also served as a focal point for the\npromotion of other important agendas, particularly in\nthe areas of socio-economic development, the rule of\nlaw, good governance and respect for human rights.\nThese goals, which reflect the aspirations of Member\nStates to build a new world free of conflict, prejudice,\ndiscrimination and oppression, must remain the\nenduring preoccupation of our common enterprise. For\nthis, we have a clear compass, not only in the Charter\nof our Organization, but also in the solemn\ncommitment of our leaders, as reflected in the\nMillennium Declaration. Let us strive to translate these\ncommitments into practical policies for the benefit of\nour peoples.\nMy country\u2019s long-standing commitment to\nfostering the objectives of the United Nations in the\narea of conflict prevention, peace and stability is well\nknown. It is regrettable that conflicts and wars continue\nto be waged in many parts of the world. It is\nparticularly disheartening that Africa has had a\ndisproportionate share of these conflicts and wars, with\ndevastating impact on our societies and peoples. Yet,\namid the apparent gloom, we see a flicker of hope. The\nprocess of peace and stability in Sierra Leone is\ngaining momentum, as the process of reconciliation,\nthrough a programme of disarmament, demobilization\nand rehabilitation, funded by the United Nations, has\ncontinued to generate trust and confidence. We are\nequally encouraged by recent developments in\nBurundi, where a newly installed interim transitional\nGovernment is grappling with the challenges of\nnational reconciliation and integration. These efforts\nattest to the determination of leaders in our continent to\nmake a success of initiatives for peace. Nigeria is\nproud to be associated with these efforts. Our\nexperience in Liberia and Sierra Leone has reinforced\nour conviction that, working in close partnership with\nregional and subregional organizations, the United\nNations can facilitate the return to peace and security\nin conflict areas. Let us provide these organizations\nwith the necessary financial and logistic support.\nApart from the commitment to durable peace and\nsecurity, there must be a re-intensification of our\nresolve to eliminate weapons of war, both conventional\nand non-conventional. Of the utmost concern to us in\nAfrica is the havoc caused by the proliferation of small\narms and light weapons. The Programme of Action\nadopted at the recently concluded United Nations\nConference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects provides us with a clear road map for\neffective cooperation. Its effective implementation will\nattest to our commitment to strengthen the forces of\ndemocracy and the rule of law in the world.\nWe recognize the inexorable march of\nglobalization and fully embrace the challenges of\nexpanding opportunities in trade, finance, information\n18\n\nand communications technology which it offers. But\nthe benefits should not be limited to only a small\nsection of the international community. Globalization\nand the twin phenomena of liberalization and\nderegulation should work for all countries. The health\nand stability of the global economic system demand\nnothing less. For us in Africa, access to such benefits\nshould be reflected in concrete actions and measures\nthat will ensure our full integration into a new and fair\nglobal economic system.\nNigeria\u2019s call for a fundamental change in current\ndebt strategies towards developing countries is derived\nfrom a keen appreciation of the impact external debt\nhas on the economic growth and political stability of\ndeveloping countries. The fact that, in spite of welcome\ninitiatives on debt relief and debt management, many\nof our countries have neither grown out of debt nor\nbeen able significantly to service their debts in a\nsustainable manner, warrants a bolder and more\nimaginative approach, such as outright debt\ncancellation.\nInternational efforts to resolve the debt problem\nshould be bolstered by collective action to discourage\nthe illegal transfer of funds from developing countries\nand the repatriation of such funds to the countries of\norigin. African leaders have established a clear linkage\nbetween our huge debt burden, the activities of foreign\ncollaborators and the transfer of funds by former\nleaders and other individuals from our continent. We\nare concerned about the corrosive impact of corruption\non our fledgling democracies and our social, economic\nand political development. Let us redouble our efforts\nto support an international instrument on the illegal\ntransfer of funds abroad.\nAt the thirty-seventh regular session of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which took\nplace in Lusaka in July, the leaders of the continent\nendorsed the New African Initiative, now called the\nNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD).\nThe inaugural meeting of the Implementation\nCommittee of Heads of State and Government on\nNEPAD took place in Abuja on 23 October 2001.\nBased on a common vision and shared conviction about\nthe need to urgently eradicate poverty and place\nAfrican countries on the path to sustainable growth and\ndevelopment, NEPAD has, among its key themes, the\npromotion of peace, democracy, human rights, social\nand economic management, regional cooperation and\neconomic integration. We appreciate the support\nalready offered, and we sincerely believe that this\nprovides the best platform for a viable partnership with\nour development partners.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose\nserious challenges to development in our world. We\nappreciate the contribution of the international\ncommunity in combating that scourge, as reflected in\nthe outcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS.\nAfrica\u2019s resolve to meet the pandemic head-on has\nstruck a responsive chord, and we are grateful to the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General for his clear\nadvocacy. I believe that we have reason to be\nencouraged by the progress made in establishing\nstructures and a multilateral framework for greater\ncooperation and support in confronting the problem.\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that the Global\nAIDS and Health Fund becomes operational by January\n2002. Meanwhile, we should maintain the momentum\nso that in the shortest possible time we bring succour to\nthose who live with AIDS or suffer from tuberculosis\nor other related infectious diseases. This is the\nexpectation of the African leaders who met in Abuja in\nApril this year to agree on a coordinated strategy on\nthis health and development crisis. Our attention\nshould also be focused on the campaign against\nmalaria, as a follow-up to an earlier summit, which\nalso took place in Abuja.\nThe rescheduling of the United Nations special\nsession on the rights of the child to May 2002 should\nprovide us with an opportunity to ponder the\nchallenges which the world\u2019s children face today. For\nus in Nigeria, the session will coincide with the\npassage of far-reaching legislation, now before the\nNational Assembly, to protect our children, and go\nbeyond the provisions of the OAU African Charter on\nthe Rights and Welfare of the Child, which we have\nrecently ratified, to revolutionize public awareness and\nthe defence of their rights. Indeed, in mid-2002,\nNigeria proposes to host an international conference\nthat will, inter alia, address the issue of trafficking in\nchildren in our region. We look forward to the\nparticipation of Member States.\nI cannot conclude without reference to the\nquestion of the reform of the United Nations system.\nNigeria maintains that, in order for the United Nations\nto meet the complex challenges of our new century,\nlong-overdue reforms of the Organization must be\nspeedily undertaken. The reform of the Security\nCouncil, in particular, constitutes one of the major\n19\n\nchallenges facing the United Nations today. Let us\nwork assiduously to complete the reform process and\nthereby make the enlarged and expanded Council truly\nrepresentative of the United Nations membership.\nMay I express our profound gratitude to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership of our\nOrganization in the past year. Nigeria rejoices with him\nover his well-deserved re-election, a reward for faithful\nstewardship and a signal of the trust and confidence of\nthe United Nations membership in his shared vision for\nthe future. No less significant is the award to him and\nto our Organization of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001.\nWe wish him well and heartily congratulate the United\nNations on that achievement.\n\n\n\n\n"

I wish to extend my congratulations to you,\nSir, and your country, the Republic of Korea, on your\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly, confident that your\nproven diplomatic skills will serve you well in guiding\nthe affairs of the General Assembly with efficiency and\npurpose. Your immediate predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, is most deserving of our thanks and\nappreciation for the very able manner in which he\npresided over the Millennium Summit and the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly. Permit me\nfurther to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his election to a second term and on the\naward of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the United\nNations.\nThis general debate is being conducted in unusual\ncircumstances. The horrendous terrorist acts of 11\nSeptember 2001 have altered the lives of many in ways\ntraumatic and fundamentally tragic. I must again\nextend deepest condolences and pledge the full support\nand solidarity of the Government and the people of the\nCommonwealth of Dominica to the Government and\nthe people of the United States of America and to all\nbereaved families, including those who lost their loved\nones on flight 587.\nThe ripple effects of those acts have resonated in\nlocations far removed from New York City,\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, aggravating\neconomic and social conditions and seriously\ndisrupting efforts aimed at meeting the many\nchallenges confronting the United Nations and the\ninternational community. In short, in one way or\nanother and to a lesser or greater degree, we are all\nvictims of those acts of terrorism that were visited\nupon the United States of America two months ago.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica condemns,\nwithout reservation, what is undoubtedly the worst\nterrorist act of our times. We are in strong accord with\nthe sentiments and mandates contained in Security\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) and\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1, all of which call\n2\n\nupon the international community to take unified and\ncooperative action to prevent and eradicate acts of\nterrorism. We understand the need for the exercise of\nthe right of self-defence in pursuit of those objectives,\nand we support the actions being taken to bring justice\nto the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of the\nterrorist acts of 11 September 2001.\nCognizant of the importance of international\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism, Dominica\nhas proceeded to establish a task force to put in place\nthe necessary legislative and executive measures for\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001). But to be effective beyond the immediate\ncrisis, counter-terrorism measures, mechanisms and\nstrategies must be sustained through a comprehensive\napproach that seeks to create and strengthen, through\nthe United Nations, a legal framework against\ninternational terrorism, complemented by strenuous\nefforts aimed at improving the social and economic\nconditions which adversely affect the poor and\ndispossessed.\nBeyond the immediate peace and security issues\naffected by the events of 11 September, there has been\na considerable impact on the global economy, which\nhas been thrown into an accelerated decline, with\nconsequences that are particularly disturbing for small\ndeveloping countries like the Commonwealth of\nDominica. In the Caribbean there is strong evidence of\ndamage to vital sectors of our economy, such as\ntourism, financial services and agriculture. The actual\nand projected losses of jobs in the region are in the\nthousands, and for those countries that were already\nexperiencing fiscal pressures the prospect of higher\nunemployment and decreased revenues is daunting.\nComplicating the problem is the great concern\nthat in the fight against terrorism and in the drive to\nenforce counter-terrorism measures, certain areas in\nwhich developing countries in the Caribbean region\nhave a competitive advantage, such as the financial\nservices sector, may be subjected to inordinate pressure\nand be unfairly targeted and linked to illegal activities\nsuch as money-laundering. We are convinced that well-\nregulated, competitive tax jurisdictions should be\ntreated separately and distinctly from illegal activities\nsuch as money-laundering. The Commonwealth of\nDominica remains firmly committed to the struggle\nagainst international terrorism to the same extent that\nwe strive to ensure that our financial services sector, a\nmajor pillar of our economic diversification thrust,\ndoes not provide support to the perpetrators of criminal\nactivity in the financing of terrorism.\nThe current effort against international terrorism\nis important, and our focus on that activity is\nwarranted. There are, however, other dimensions of the\nglobal agenda which should command the attention of\nthe international community and the United Nations.\nThey cannot be relegated to the back burner of our\nconcerns. They comprise a wide range of economic,\nsocial, political and humanitarian problems faced on a\ndaily basis and, for the most part, by the poor and\ndisadvantaged of the world. Indeed, some of them are\nlikely to be exacerbated by the fight against terrorism,\nand their successful resolution will continue to be the\ngreatest challenge of the United Nations and the\ninternational community.\nAt the Millennium Summit last year there was\ngeneral agreement on the issues needing urgent\nattention and the goals to be achieved. One year later\nthose goals appear to be as far from being realized as\never. Commitment appears to be lacking on all fronts.\nThe objective of a 50 per cent reduction in the number\nof persons living in poverty worldwide by the year\n2015 suffers from the perennially tepid effort to deal\nwith the root causes of poverty. Contributions from the\nindustrial countries are woefully inadequate, and the\nrequired adjustment of the strategies of the\ninternational financial institutions is slow in coming.\nThe outcome is less than desirable in creating and\nmaintaining an enabling environment for the more\neffective management of projects geared to poverty\nreduction.\nThat lack of commitment is evident in other\nareas. A year after the Millennium Summit and six\nmonths after the General Assembly special session on\nHIV/AIDS, the international community seems to have\nlost interest in a crisis that the Secretary-General\nlabelled the greatest public health challenge of our\ntimes. As front-page news, HIV/AIDS claimed\nattention for only a short time after the special session,\nbut the disease claimed millions of lives last year and\ncreated millions of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa,\nwhich continues to have the highest rates of infection.\nThe Caribbean region ranks a close second.\nThe Global Fund for AIDS and Health proposed\nby the Secretary-General is clearly not realizing its\nspending target of $7 billion to $10 billion, and will not\nbe able to achieve the stated goal of reversing the\n3\n\nspread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, as declared by world\nleaders at the Millennium Summit. The majority of\npeople infected with HIV/AIDS live in the developing\nworld and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection is\nconsidered a function of poverty. The circularity of the\nproblem has tremendous implications for economic\ndevelopment, poverty reduction and efforts to raise\nliving standards in developing countries. The accepted\npremise is that international development cooperation\nplays a vital role in the development of the mechanisms\nnecessary for enhancing the trade competitiveness of\ndeveloping countries, strengthening financial systems,\nand developing human resources, but that role is\nclearly undermined by the declining trend in official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA).\nOnce again we see the lack of commitment to the\nfulfilment of a stated goal. It is generally accepted that\nwere industrialized countries to meet their promised\nofficial development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product (GNP), the countries of the\ndeveloping world would be much nearer to solving\nmany of the problems with which they are plagued. As\na substitute for the failed promise, developing\ncountries have been told to place greater reliance on\nforeign direct investment, most of which bypasses the\nmost needy and the smallest economies. The\nCommonwealth of Dominica falls into that category of\nStates for which official development assistance is\nvitally critical to the development of their economies.\nThat is why the Commonwealth of Dominica and other\nStates in the region attach such importance to the\nconvening of the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, which will be held in\nMexico from 18 to 22 March 2002. Given the changing\nglobal realities that are impacting adversely on the\neconomies of developing States, the Conference will\nprovide an opportunity for us to assess the impact of\ndeclining official development assistance and for\ncreating new mechanisms for financing development.\nOver the past several years and in many different\nforums, particularly in the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), we have been calling for the formal\nrecognition of the special problems facing small\nvulnerable economies. We fear that without such\nrecognition it will be impossible for small States to be\nfully integrated into the multilateral trading system of\nthe globalized world. Our fears have been confirmed\nboth by the generally poor performance of small States\nunder WTO arrangements and by a very authoritative\nreport by the World Bank and Commonwealth\nSecretariat on the issue of smallness and vulnerability.\nThe unique characteristics of small vulnerable\neconomies, which have been articulated in numerous\nstudies, give a clear indication of the challenges that\nthese economies face in improving their development\nprospects and in adjusting to liberalization and\nglobalization. Many of these economies are at a\ncrossroads. The reality is that trade preferences are\neroding; official flows are declining, while historical\nties with former partners in development are fading. It\nis therefore imperative that in order to prevent further\nmarginalization of small economies, steps must be\ntaken in the multilateral trading system and elsewhere\nto address the concerns of those economies and to\nensure their growth and development.\nThe exclusion of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan from membership of the United Nations makes\nlittle sense in today\u2019s world of globalization and\ninterdependence, particularly in light of the fact that\nthis sovereign State, with a democratically elected\nGovernment, is the world\u2019s seventeenth largest\neconomy, the fifteenth largest in international trade, the\neighth largest foreign investor, the fourth largest in\nterms of foreign exchange reserves, and the third\nlargest exporter of information technology (IT)\nproducts. The Commonwealth of Dominica intends no\ninterference in the internal affairs of any Member\nState, nor can such interpretation be validly applied to\nour action. Our plea is a simple call for justice for the\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nand an appeal for the recognition of their right to be\ntreated in international affairs no differently from\ncitizens of any other country.\nThe eleventh of September 2001 will undoubtedly\nbe remembered for the horrifying nature of the terrorist\nacts, the magnitude of the senseless destruction of lives\nand property and the forced recognition of our common\nvulnerability. But the heroism, the extraordinary\nfortitude and selflessness of ordinary men and women,\nand the demonstrated triumph of the human spirit over\nthe worst manifestation of evil, inspire us to hope that\nwith dedicated commitment we can create for all\nmankind a world that is measurably better than that\nwhich we have today. The time to begin is now.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am glad to\nextend to you, Sir, my congratulations on your election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at this\nimportant session. We are fully confident that you will\nguide its work to complete success. I am also pleased\nto congratulate the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\non his re-election to a second term of office.\nThis session of the General Assembly acquires\nspecial importance given that it is being held at a time\nwhen the international family is facing increasingly\nserious problems. The deterioration of the international\npolitical and economic environment has reached an\nalarming point, threatening the very core of the\nindividual and collective security of the Member States\nand the future of humanity as a whole.\nInstability in international relations has increased\nas a result of the unilateral management of\ninternational affairs on the basis of the law of brute\nforce. There has been a proliferation of such\nphenomena as the unilateral use of force, infringement\nof international law and the Charter, political\nblackmail, blockades and violation of peoples\u2019 rights to\ndetermine their own political, economic and social\nchoices. The suffering of the peoples of developing\ncountries has increased as a result of the lack of\neconomic and social development and the widespread\ntendencies among wealthy nations to impose their\neconomic hegemony and technical and scientific\nblockades under the guise of globalization. Attempts\nare increasing to impose certain cultures on the peoples\nof the world, heaping scorn on their religious beliefs,\ncreeds and political and social choices and preaching\nthe clash of civilizations and the launching of new\ncrusades.\nIt was in these circumstances that the events of 11\nSeptember took place in the United States, with all the\nensuing suffering and victims. While we have offered\nour sincere condolences to the American people and\nthe families of the innocent victims of these events,\nIraq has expressed its hope that the United States will\ndeal with these events in a spirit of wisdom and\nresponsibility by undertaking a comprehensive review\nof its policies towards other peoples and States with a\nview to finding ways to ensure security, stability and\npeace for the people of the United States and for all the\npeoples of the world.\nThe United States, however, has once again\nresorted to the logic of brute force; hence its aggression\nagainst Afghanistan. Then came the use of biological\nmaterials in subversive operations, whose source,\naccording to American authorities, is most likely to be\nfound in the United States. All this was accompanied\nby Western media campaigns intended to kindle\nfeelings of rancour, hatred and chauvinism and to stoke\nthe fires of war and aggression in the world. This\nconfirms that the present world order is extremely\nfragile and that the fires of any conflagration anywhere\ncould spread to the whole world. Indeed, wide as it is,\nthe world could be set on fire by a spark coming from\nthe West. The world needs to save itself from falling\ninto an abyss, to which it is being pushed by policies\nthat have their roots in hubris, arrogance, injustice and\n20\n\naggression. The world needs justice based on fairness;\nit should not use force on the basis of power and\nadvantage. Perceiving the dangers to which the world\nis being exposed, our leader President Saddam Hussein\nof the Republic of Iraq has called for acting wisely and\nreasonably to spare humanity the scourges of\nvengeance, war, rancour and hatred. On 29 October\n2001, he launched an initiative calling for the world to\ncooperate, on the basis of a global agreement, to rid\nitself of the burden and dangers of weapons of mass\ndestruction, beginning with the huge arsenal of such\nweapons stockpiled primarily in the United States and\nsecondarily in the Zionist entity. In his initiative,\nPresident Saddam Hussein emphasized that,\n\u201cWhen the United States begins to divest itself of\nits weapons of mass destruction with the rest of\nthe world following suit, the United States will\nfind its way to the paths of wisdom. The world\nwill treat it with respect and love after sensing the\nrespect and love coming from it. The world,\nincluding the United States, will then have peace,\nrather than stand at the brink of the abyss.\u201d\nFrom this rostrum we call for reason, wisdom and\nthe rule of law to prevail over impetuosity, recklessness\nand the law of brute force. We stress the importance of\nproceeding with a comprehensive objective effort to rid\nthe world of all weapons of mass destruction and to set\nup a just and equitable international order in which all\ncan enjoy peace, security and prosperity. It is now clear\nthat the current discriminatory theories of non-\nproliferation and the mindset of drawing a distinction\nbetween safe and unsafe possession of weapons of\nmass destruction will not lead to a lessening of the\ndangers to the world, but instead to the exact opposite.\nIraq has suffered and continues to suffer\naggression and terrorism. Its leaders, officials and\nnationals have been subjected to numerous terrorist\nattempts on their lives. Its towns and villages have\nbeen the targets of many acts of terrorism at the hands\nof terrorist infiltrators coming from across the border,\nwho are sponsored, trained, financed and armed within\nthe framework of State terrorism.\nThe Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peaceful\npurposes was the target of a terrorist attack by\nwarplanes of the Zionist entity in 1981. Iraq\u2019s towns\nand villages and economic, scientific and cultural\nfacilities were also systematically targeted and\ndestroyed in the course of the aggression launched by\nthe United States and the United Kingdom and their\nallies in 1991 and in the five large-scale attacks that\nfollowed in 1993, 1996, 1998 and 2001. Furthermore,\nfor 11 years now Iraq has suffered comprehensive\nsanctions that have deprived its people and that have so\nfar claimed the lives of 1.6 million civilians, the\nmajority of whom are children and the elderly. Both the\naggression and the comprehensive sanctions constitute\nsystematic State terrorism directed against an entire\npeople.\nThe daily aggression launched by aircraft of the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom against Iraqi\ntowns and villages within the so-called no-fly zones\nimposed by these two States on the basis of a unilateral\nand illegal decision taken in flagrant violation of the\nCharter of the United Nations and international law is\nalso State terrorism. We must also mention the\nexplosions carried out in certain Iraqi border areas by\nelements of mercenary infiltrators, who are financed,\narmed and harboured by certain States, including the\nUnited States, which openly spends tens of millions of\ndollars on mercenary bands for the purpose of carrying\nout terrorist operations in Iraq under the so-called Iraq\nLiberation Act. The term \u201cterrorism\u201d also applies to the\nuse by the United States and the United Kingdom of\nmore than 300 tons of depleted uranium ammunition\nagainst the people of Iraq in 1991. Through the ensuing\ntoxic radiological effects, this has led to an increase in\nthe number of embryonic deformities, a tenfold\nincrease in cancer cases and pollution of the\nenvironment of the region for many generations to\ncome.\nAll these and other acts that violate the principles\nof international law are acts of terrorism. In the face of\nthese acts of terrorism and aggression, Iraq has made\nmany sacrifices in defence of its sovereignty,\nindependence, dignity and national choices. The brave\npeople of Iraq are more determined today than at any\ntime in the past. They take pride in and cherish their\nnational leadership, holding fast to their sovereignty,\ndignity and national and regional interests, defending\ntheir independence and political choices and defying\nall the evil intentions that stand behind the aggression\nand acts of terrorism directed against them.\nThe fact that Iraq is a victim of international\nterrorism has made it one of the first countries to call\nfor combating terrorism. Iraqi national legislation\nprovides for harsher punishment for terrorist acts. Iraq\nhas signed and ratified most international conventions\n21\n\nin force against terrorism. Iraq believes that, in order to\nconfront international terrorism, including State\nterrorism, it is necessary to initiate, under the umbrella\nof the United Nations, an international effort to reach\nagreement on a definition of terrorism and on ways to\ncombat it, in accordance with international law and the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nIraq is prepared to participate actively in such an\ninternational effort to combat terrorism in all its forms,\nwhether perpetrated by individuals, groups or States.\nHere, it is necessary to emphasize the natural,\ninalienable right of all peoples to defend their\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as\nwell as to struggle against all forms of terrorism,\nincluding foreign occupation, colonialist control and\naggression in all its military and economic forms,\nintervention in the internal affairs of States and the\ninstigation and financing of ethnic and religious\nconflicts among peoples of the world. All these rights\nare embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and\ninternational law.\nIn discussing the question of reforming the\ncurrent unsound state of international relations, we\nmust point out the need to reform international\nmechanisms, foremost among which is the Security\nCouncil, to which the Member States of the United\nNations have entrusted the primary responsibility of\nmaintaining international peace and security.\nThe practices of the Security Council, especially\nin the last 11 years, have made it clear that the Council\nis no longer true to its role as specified by the Charter;\nthat it has become a tool for implementing the policies\nof one single State; and that it now stands as a glaring\nmodel practitioner of double standards. Suffice it to\ncite, as just one example among many, the fact that the\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed by the Council on\nIraq constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter and\nthe mandate of the Council. This was admitted by the\nUnited Nations itself, as stated in the report entitled\n\u201cThe right to food\u201d, submitted under cover of the\nSecretary-General\u2019s note of 23 July 2001, in which the\nSpecial Rapporteur of the Commission on Human\nRights on the right to food said:\n\u201cThere can be little doubt that subjecting the Iraqi\npeople to a harsh economic embargo since 1991\nhas placed the United Nations in a clear violation\nof the obligation to respect the right to food of\npeople in Iraq.\u201d (A/56/210, para. 56)\nLikewise, the expert of the Subcommission on the\nPromotion and Protection of Human Rights had this to\nsay on the subject in a report dated 21 June 2000:\n\u201cThe sanctions regime against Iraq is\nunequivocally illegal under existing international\nhumanitarian law and human rights law. Some\nwould go as far as making a charge of genocide.\u201d\n(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33, para. 71)\nWe therefore call for a comprehensive reform of\nthe Security Council that would lead to the expansion\nof its membership and to the reform of its methods of\nwork, with specific reference to its decision-making\nprocess, so as to ensure full respect by the Council for\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and the\nprinciple of democracy in international relations.\nIt has also become necessary to establish a\nmechanism for judicial review that would rule on the\nlegality and constitutionality of Security Council\nresolutions in order to ensure that they are consistent\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and with international law. We believe\nthat Member States should be able to resort to the\nInternational Court of Justice to appeal resolutions of\nthe Security Council which these States consider as\ninvolving infringement on the principles of the Charter\nand international law.\nThus we will be able to remedy this flagrant\ndeviation from all democratic, judicial and legal norms\nand principles in the work and mandate of the Security\nCouncil.\nPending the completion of the process of\nreforming the Security Council and of ensuring that it\nplays its role in conformity with the Charter, States\nMembers of the United Nations should reconsider their\nauthorization to the Council to act on their behalf in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, since\nthe Council has abused that authorization. There is no\nmore obvious case in this regard than that of the\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq. No just-\nthinking State can afford to remain a spectator when it\nsees the authorization it granted to the Security Council\nbeing used to annihilate the people of Iraq.\nIt is the legal and moral obligation of all States\nthat respect international law and the Charter of the\nUnited Nations to declare that they are not parties to\nthis crime and that they did not authorize the Security\nCouncil to kill the children of Iraq in their name. The\n22\n\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq have\ninflicted enormous damage on the interests of a\nconsiderable number of the countries of the world, and\nthese countries are called upon to put a stop to these\nillegal acts and to restore their trade relations with Iraq,\nin implementation of Article 50 of the Charter.\nThe organized terrorism to which the people of\nPalestine are being subjected by the Zionist entity, the\nfounder and primary source of terrorism, can be seen in\nthe bombing of towns, villages, camps and Islamic and\nChristian houses of worship, as well as in political\nassassinations, imposition of collective punishments,\noccupation of Muslim holy sites, use of depleted\nuranium ammunitions and poison gases, bulldozing of\nfarms and confiscation of lands.\nThis organized terrorism calls for a reaction on\nthe part of the international community that is\ncommensurate with the gravity of these genocidal\npractices against a whole people. Similarly, the\nsystematic destruction to which the Afghan people are\nbeing subjected at the hands of the American military\nmachine is an illegal unilateral use of force and should\ncome to an end. I should like to refer here to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s 1999 annual report on the work of\nthe Organization, in which he stated that\n\u201cenforcement actions without Security Council\nauthorization threaten the very core of the\ninternational security system founded on the\nCharter of the United Nations\u201d (A/54/1, para. 66).\nWe demand an end to this interference in the\ninternal affairs of Afghanistan. The Afghan people\nshould be able to make their own political choices, in\nconformity with their national interests and without\nany external interference, under whatever pretext.\nThe United Nations was founded for the purpose\nof achieving security, peace and stability, so that social\nand economic progress for all peoples might be\npromoted by a number of means, including avoidance\nof wars and conflicts. But today two thirds of the\npopulation of the world suffer from underdevelopment\nand live in misery, while the few live in prosperity.\nWhat is required is to reactivate the role of the United\nNations in the search for a balanced international\neconomic policy that will lead to greater equality\namong peoples and States, lessen the intensity of\npolitical conflicts and feelings of frustration, engage all\nas partners in building the world economy, promote\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and bring\nabout a better life for peoples.\nEfforts to reform the international political\nenvironment will not meet with success if they are not\naccompanied by efforts to reform the economic\nenvironment with a view to extending prosperity to all\nhumankind. We must remember that the vast resources\nwith which God Almighty has favoured our planet\nEarth are sufficient to enable us to achieve prosperity,\nsecurity and stability for all. What we need is the\nconviction that all human beings are equal in terms of\ntheir worth, and we must work hard to avert, and put an\nend to, all policies and actions that violate this truth\nand cause upheavals in international relations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by\nexpressing my congratulations to you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly. The\nfifty-sixth session is clearly going to be a challenging\none, and one that I predict will further strengthen the\nresolve of members to work hand in hand on all the\ndifferent issues requiring our attention. I would like\nalso to convey my appreciation to His Excellency Mr.\nHarri Holkeri for the determined and skilful manner in\nwhich he presided over the previous session.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the United Nations and its tireless\nSecretary-General on the Nobel Peace Prize that they\nhave jointly and so deservedly been awarded.\nThis session started in a markedly different\nmanner from those of previous years. The horrendous\n11 September terrorist attacks brought home the very\nreal threat of terrorism to each and every one of us no\nmatter what corner of the world we inhabit.\nInternational terrorism does not limit its actions to\nindividual countries. In fact, although the attacks were\nlaunched on United States soil, the specific targets\nchosen clearly show the intent to destroy symbols of\nthe modern world, icons to free people everywhere.\nIndeed, by attacking this cosmopolitan city and\nits World Trade Center, the perpetrators targeted us all.\nNationals of more than 60 countries met their death in\nthose dastardly attacks. Even if our own nationals were\nnot among those who lost their lives, we all felt under\nattack. We all felt violated. In one way or another, our\nlives have been altered forever, and we must respond\naccordingly.\nWe must fight the scourge of terrorism with\nunreserved and unhesitating resolve. We must do this\nnot merely as a means to defend all that we hold dear.\nWe must do it to secure a safer world for ourselves, for\nthose who will follow us and for those who have had\ntheir lives irrevocably transformed as a result of these\nterrorist attacks. That resolve must be our tribute to the\ninnocent and the brave who lost their lives in the l1\nSeptember attacks.\nThe two-month postponement of the general\ndebate has provided us with time to reflect and to act.\nMalta has joined the international community\u2019s\nabsolute and unreserved condemnation of the terrorist\nacts. We have also stepped up our action in pursuit of\nthe effective implementation of anti-terrorism\n6\n\nmeasures, including comprehensive compliance with\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nMalta was among the first six countries to sign\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, and yesterday became one of\nthe first States to ratify it. On Sunday, Malta also\nacceded to the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents; to the\nInternational Convention against the Taking of\nHostages; and to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings.\nThe new realities of today\u2019s world have certainly\nbrought to the fore the importance of those conventions\non terrorism. At the same time, they have also brought\ninto bold relief the wisdom that underpins the efforts of\nthe international community in its pursuit of the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. My\nGovernment is politically committed to the Court and\nwill seek ratification of the Rome Statute by the\nMaltese parliament in the near future. We feel that, in\nthat way, we are doing all we can to ensure that no\nstone is left unturned in our fight against terrorism.\nWith each passing day, we witness the domino\neffect that acts of terror may have at a national,\nregional and global level. The impact this has on the\nlives of millions must be addressed. We feel therefore\nthat the time is ripe to conclude the debate on an\noperational definition of the perpetration of a terrorist\nact. Intensified efforts aimed at the expeditious\nconclusion of negotiations on the Indian proposal\nshould subsequently yield a comprehensive convention\non international terrorism, which will be of benefit to\nus all. We firmly believe that such an umbrella\nagreement will give added value to, and further\ncomplement, other existing conventions on terrorism.\nWe also believe that the General Assembly should\nactively consider convening a high-level conference on\nterrorism under United Nations auspices upon or\nimmediately after the conclusion of such a convention.\nThat would serve to reinforce ongoing international\nefforts to formulate a collective response to terrorism.\nThe unity of purpose currently prevailing within\nthe international community in its fight against\nterrorism is perhaps unprecedented. Indeed, the\npolitical will displayed over the past two months is a\nclear manifestation, if any were needed, that\nmultilateralism remains a vital tool in the conduct of\nrelations among States at a global level. That political\nwill has also been seen in the other work of the\nOrganization. Allow me therefore to turn to other\nissues on the agenda of the General Assembly.\nI would like first to express my Government\u2019s full\nsupport for the initiative of the German and French\nGovernments to bring the issue of human cloning\nbefore the United Nations. Aimed at drafting a\nconvention banning human cloning for the purposes of\nreproduction, that initiative has received wide support\nfrom all quarters. The concern expressed underlines the\nfundamental nature of the threat to humanity posed by\nscientists who are unwilling to accept ethical and moral\nlimits on their work. In responding to the Franco-\nGerman initiative, the United Nations will ensure that a\nstrong and meaningful convention can be drafted and\nadopted within as short a time frame as possible.\nThe United Nations has already had occasion to\nexhibit its ability to act swiftly and decisively when the\nconscience of the international community is\nheightened. The entry into force of the Ottawa\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\non Their Destruction, which Malta ratified earlier this\nyear, was made possible by the international\ncommunity\u2019s outrage at the devastating impact of those\nindiscriminate weapons, whose horrific effects long\noutlast their military purpose.\nSimilarly, the seriousness and urgency of the\nproblem of human cloning should expedite the\nconclusion of an internationally binding agreement on\nthat issue. I have no doubt that the richly diverse\nbeliefs reflected in this room are united in their respect\nfor human dignity and identity, and their concern with\nthe fundamental and far-reaching implications of\nhuman cloning.\nOther world events continue to pose a threat to\nthe fundamental right of peoples to live in a secure,\nstable and prosperous environment. The current state of\naffairs in the Middle East is an example. The dramatic\ncontrast between the optimism apparent at the\nMillennium Assembly\u2019s opening and the escalation in\nviolence over the past few months has made it\nincreasingly difficult for the parties to return to the\npositions they were in just over 12 months ago.\nMalta is convinced that the Mitchell report and\nthe Tenet Plan provide a realistic and readily\nachievable way out of the spiral of violence that has\n7\n\nengulfed the region. The peace, security and welfare of\nall the people concerned require that their full\nimplementation be urgently embarked upon. This\nnecessitates the re-establishment of security\ncooperation between the parties in the interests of both\nIsraelis and Palestinians; the stationing of international\nobservers, preferably from several regions; and an end\nto all new settlement activity, including so-called\n\u201cnatural growth\u201d. Against this backdrop, Malta hopes\nthat both parties will be able to return to the\nnegotiating table with the aim of achieving a just and\npermanent peace in the region on the basis of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\nAlso in the Mediterranean, the situation in Cyprus\nhas remained a cause of concern for over 25 years. We\nearnestly hope that an early settlement of the Cyprus\nquestion will be found. In this connection, we reaffirm\nour full support for efforts to find a solution on the\nbasis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nProgress towards lasting peace and stability in the\nMediterranean often appears to unfold very slowly.\nEvents in the Balkans since we met here last year,\nhowever, bring fresh hope to us all. The end of the\nMilosevic era was a clear example of the positive\nchange that can be wrought through the power of the\npeople, signalling a fresh beginning for the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and indeed for all the\nneighbouring independent republics.\nIn recent months, turmoil and unrest have also\nthreatened to engulf the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia. Yet the unfolding situation now reveals\nencouraging signs of the power of diplomacy.\nInternational assistance extended to republics in the\nBalkan region is also indicative of the power within\neach of us to make our own contribution and to play a\npart.\nMalta feels this onus most strongly and actively\nseeks to play a role on the international stage that goes\nbeyond the mere limitations of its geographical size. In\nfact, in keeping with this consciousness, Malta is\nproceeding steadily towards its objective of acceding to\nthe European Union \u2014 a union of like-minded States\nwhere we naturally belong, not only politically, but\nalso economically, culturally and historically. Our\nintention is therefore to become an integral part of the\nEuropean Union at its next enlargement, enabling us to\nparticipate fully in a decision-making process that all\ntoo often carries wide-ranging implications for our\ncountry.\nLike other candidate countries, Malta is currently\nnegotiating the terms of entry into the European Union\nin what will be an unprecedented widening and\ndeepening of the Union. Already more than halfway\nthrough this process, we are working hard to ensure\nthat Malta is not only well equipped to deal with the\nchallenges of membership but is also in a position to\nmake a significant contribution to the Union. This\nhistoric project and the enhancement of Mediterranean\ncooperation are both of immediate concern to Malta.\nWe feel that they go hand in hand.\nAn increase in dialogue between all nations and a\nmove towards securing a safer planet are in everyone\u2019s\ninterest. However, threats to international security, not\nleast those posed by weapons of mass destruction,\ncontinue to lurk in the background. In July this year,\nMalta deposited its instrument of ratification of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Malta hopes\nthat the remaining 13 countries whose ratification is\nnecessary for the Treaty to come into force will join the\n84 countries that have already done this. Thus a\nsignificant collective step will have been taken towards\nreducing the risk of nuclear disaster.\nNot so long ago, the terms \u201cenvironment\u201d and\n\u201cinternational security\u201d in the same sentence would\nhave drawn a perplexed response from most audiences.\nToday, the link between the two is becoming\nincreasingly apparent. The urgency in addressing the\ngreatest threats to our natural environment was made\namply clear in Bonn during the sixth session of the\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Despite\nbeing faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles,\nthe international community succeeded in forging the\nEarth\u2019s first major action-oriented response to the\nphenomenon of global warming.\nIn this respect, allow me to offer my\nGovernment\u2019s expression of gratitude to the Chairman\nof the Conference, Mr. Jan Pronk, as well as to my\ncompatriot Mr. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive\nSecretary of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, for their enormous\npersonal efforts to secure a successful outcome. Their\nsuccess laid the groundwork for the breakthrough\nachieved at the seventh session of the Conference in\nMarrakech last week. The agreement on the modalities\n8\n\nof implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has opened\nthe door to its ratification by all States signatories.\nIndeed, Malta deposited its instrument of ratification\nyesterday and looks forward to the present momentum\nbeing sustained, leading to an early entry into force of\nthis landmark Protocol.\nDifficult and complex as it may be to tackle\nenvironmental global problems, the most challenging\nenvironmental problems are often those in our own\nbackyards. With one of the highest population densities\nin the world, Malta has achieved a high level of human\ndevelopment without any natural resources at its\ndisposal. In seeking to continue to raise our living\nstandards, we grapple daily with difficult decisions\naimed at ensuring that economic development on our\nislands is environmentally sustainable.\nThere is no simple trade-off between the\nprotection of the environment and the production of\nwealth. The Mediterranean Sea, which provides Malta\nwith its economic lifeline, is perhaps the most tangible\nproof of the fact that economic progress at the expense\nof the environment is no progress at all. In reaping its\nbountiful fruits, we know that they are not unlimited\nand, if not tended to, will dry up altogether. The same\napplies to other seas and oceans.\nWith this in mind, Malta yesterday became the\nthirtieth State to accede to the Agreement for the\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea relating to the\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks \u2014 a move\nthat will bring the Agreement itself into force on 11\nDecember 2001. For Malta, having initiated the process\nthat led to the United Nations Convention on the Law\nof the Sea, it is a source of great satisfaction to\ncontribute to the further development of this veritable\npillar of international law.\nWhile there is inevitably still more that can be\ndone, both at a domestic and an international level, I\nhope that this General Assembly session will serve as a\nrenewed impetus for us all to promote everything\nnecessary to make the world safer and more secure.\nThis is our fundamental duty, as political leaders, for\nthe welfare of present and future generations. We must\ncontinue to foster social justice, promote equitable\ndevelopment, nurture confidence among peoples, settle\nconflicts and take the appropriate measures to ensure\nsecurity for all. Yet in doing all this, Governments and\npeoples must ensure that we continue first and\nforemost to build peace in the minds of men and\nwomen. That undertaking, adopted by the generation\nthat survived the Second World War, retains its noble\nauthenticity today as we face the challenges of our own\ntimes."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am\npleased, first of all, to convey through you, Sir, our\nsincere congratulations to President Han Seung-soo on\n28\n\nhis election as President of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am certain that with his expertise\nand skill he will conduct the proceedings of this\nsession successfully. I should also like to express our\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for\nthe distinction with which he conducted the\nproceedings of the last session.\nOur current meetings are convened amid\nextraordinary circumstances arising from the acts of\nterrorism committed against the United States of\nAmerica on the very day set for the opening of this\nsession. It is regrettable that the first session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly of the twenty-first\ncentury should be convened in the aftermath of those\nalarming events. These events truly constitute a\nnegative phenomenon that will have major\nrepercussions on inter-State relations at the bilateral\nand multilateral levels alike. Furthermore, these events\nhave convinced everyone that there is no alternative to\ncollective endeavour through legitimate structures to\nconfront the challenges of the future. We would like to\nstress the necessity of supporting the United Nations as\nan ideal framework for international cooperation,\nparticularly at this stage when collective endeavour is\nindispensable for coping with the problems that now, in\nthe era of globalization, affect us all to a greater or\nlesser extent. In this connection, we congratulate the\nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001,\nwhich has come at an appropriate time as an\nappreciative expression of the role of the Organization\nand the effective leadership of its Secretary-General.\nThe perseverance of the host country in ensuring\nquasi-normal conditions for the work of this session\nreflects a will to transcend the catastrophe and displays\nconfidence in the triumph of reason. Permit me, as I\nstand at the heart of this great and wounded city, to\nconvey, on behalf of the leadership, Government and\npeople of Yemen, our sincere condolences and deepest\nsympathy to the American President, the Government\nand people of the United States, and to convey these\nsentiments in particular to the families of the innocent\nvictims whose lives were lost in the tragic events of 11\nSeptember.\nAlthough the scourge of terrorism has struck the\nUnited States this time, claiming thousands of innocent\nvictims, the phenomenon of terrorism is not new.\nIndeed, it is directed against the whole world. These\nrecent acts of terrorism claimed victims from 70\nforeign countries, including Yemen. These acts were\nnot targeted against the United States and Americans\nalone; rather, the target was international peace and\nsecurity. Regrettably, the phenomenon of terrorism has\nworsened because of negligence in confronting it. We\nin the Republic of Yemen have not been spared the\nperils and threats of terrorism. Our country has been\nscorched by its fire and afflicted in many ways, but our\nappeals for timely, effective cooperation fell on deaf\nears.\nToday, in the face of this loathsome act of\nterrorism, the Republic of Yemen reiterates its stand,\ncondemning terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, whatever its causes and sources. As we\nproclaim the readiness of the Government of the\nRepublic of Yemen to strive, within the framework of\ninternational legitimacy, for the elimination of\nterrorism, we also affirm our desire that those\nendeavours not lead to the suffering of innocent\npersons or to the practice of oppression that will result\nin the emergence of a new generation of terrorists.\nWe also affirm the Arab Islamic position that\nrejects attempts to link terrorism to Arabs and\nMuslims. Terrorism, as history teaches us, has no\nreligion, no homeland and no identity. On the same\ngrounds, Yemen censures the voices that stir up\npropaganda for a clash of civilizations or, to be precise,\na clash of Islam with Christianity. Instead, we call for a\nmeaningful intercultural dialogue and for the creation\nof common concepts centred on justice, human and\nreligious values.\nThe desire to combat and eliminate terrorism\nmakes it incumbent upon the international community\nto launch an unremitting campaign based on uniform\nand clearly defined criteria identifying terrorists, be\nthey individuals, or collective or State terrorism. The\ninternational community cannot shirk its responsibility\nto oppose State terrorism \u2014 just as it opposes terrorism\nby individuals and groups.\nLogically, it follows that the Security Council\nshould put an end to the crimes committed daily by\nIsrael against the Palestinian people forcing Israel to\nwithdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to\nimplement the resolutions of international legitimacy,\nfirst and foremost of which are Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In this regard,\nthe Republic of Yemen proclaims that it welcomes\nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s statement on the necessity\n29\n\nof establishing a Palestinian State with all the elements\nof sovereignty. This declaration has met with ever-\nincreasing international support. Israel must realize that\nits security is bound up with its neighbour\u2019s security\nand that its secure future lies in the inevitable\nacceptance of the Palestinian people\u2019s right to establish\ntheir own independent State and in its respecting the\nPalestinians\u2019 sovereignty over their territory.\nToday\u2019s world is characterized by rapid\ntransformations that, taken as a whole, are the natural\nlabour pains that precede the birth of a new reality\nreflecting humankind\u2019s yearning for a more just and\nprosperous world. The current reality and nature of\ninternational relations differ from those of the 1990s;\nin fact, they differ to some extent from the prevailing\nsituation only two months ago, to be precise, prior to\nthe tragic and bloody events of September. These\nevents diverted attention from globalization issues, the\nfurthering of the democratic process and the diffusion\nof human rights to an endeavour to confront and\neliminate terrorism. Everyone is aware that the\nexigencies of combating and eradicating terrorism\ndemand adherence to democratic decision-making\nmethods. Decisions must be adopted on the basis of\nagreement and participation, exactly as is required at\nthe national level.\nThe logic of force has unquestionably become an\noutdated logic, which can in no way lead to the\nestablishment of sound international relations or ensure\nlasting solutions to the problems that inevitably arise\nfrom time to time in inter-State relations. The Republic\nof Yemen has striven tirelessly to ensure the best\nmeans of achieving peace and stability at the regional\nand world levels, and has adhered to the course of\nresolving disputes by peaceful means and by accepting\nand adhering to the principle of good-neighbourliness.\nOn this basis, our political leadership, represented\nby President Ali Abdullah Saleh, has made continuous\nand unremitting efforts to help end the strife between\nthe warring factions in fraternal Somalia. It hastened to\nwelcome the outcome of the Arta Peace Conference\nand was among the first to support the provisional\nnational Government, under the leadership of President\nSalad Hassan, as a legitimate entity representing\nSomali national consensus.\nThe ordeal that our Somali brothers are\nexperiencing, both inside and outside the country,\nconfronts the international community with its\nresponsibility to provide aid and support to the\nprovisional Government and to increase assistance to\nthe Somali refugees in neighbouring countries,\nincluding our own. Our country has opened its arms to\nsome 150,000 of our Somali brothers, despite the\ndifficult economic circumstances it is currently\nexperiencing.\nRecent events have proved beyond doubt that\nthere is an urgent need to amend the rules of\ninternational relations so as to ensure consensus in\ndecision-making and collective participation in efforts\nto confront the growing challenges and dangers that\nface us all and that are not confined within the borders\nof any one State. That naturally makes it imperative to\nreconsider the policy of imposing international\nembargoes and sanctions that do not represent the\ncollective will nor the required agreements, while the\nfacts affirm their harmfulness and futility.\nThe sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people and\nthe suffering of that people are a burden on the human\nconscience, and their continuation raises an increasing\nnumber of questions about the truth of the aims behind\nthe insistence on their maintenance, now that the\njustifications for the decision to impose those sanctions\nno longer exist: Iraq has committed itself to\nimplementing the United Nations resolutions\nguaranteeing Kuwait\u2019s security and sovereignty over its\nterritory. My country has used its good offices with\nfraternal Kuwait and Iraq and continues to do so, with\na view to finding a solution to the issue of Kuwaiti and\nother prisoners and missing persons, and cooperating in\nthe settlement of this distressing issue. Here, we would\nlike to express our happiness at the decision taken by\nthe Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed on\nSudan.\nAt a time when fraternal Libya and certain other\nStates are still suffering from unjust embargo policies,\nthere is an urgent need to reconsider those embargo\nresolutions that have become obsolete and have been\novertaken by events.\nOne cause for optimism is the desire shown by\nboth the United Arab Emirates and Iran, and the\ncurrent contacts between them, to find a solution to the\nissue of the three islands of the Emirates in the Arabian\nGulf. Yemen welcomes this move by the two fraternal\nStates while wishing to affirm that direct talks or\ninternational arbitration are the option that will\n30\n\npreserve the security of the region and strengthen\nrelations between the two countries.\nDeveloping countries are still experiencing\nextremely difficult economic and social conditions, and\nthe financial sources for national development\ninvestment are almost non-existent, since external debt\nand debt servicing consume most national development\nearnings. This is evident in the least developed\ncountries, a group to which the Republic of Yemen\nbelongs. In this context, we deem it essential to strive\nto implement the recommendations of the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\nThe Republic of Yemen wishes to participate in\nthe preparatory meetings for the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Mexico, as it is an international gathering\nthat will address, inter alia, issues related to the\nmobilization of the financial resources necessary for\ncomprehensive development activities. These include\ncommitment to pay official development assistance\npledges, considering the development of ways to\nincrease the domestic resources necessary for\ndevelopment activities and increasing donor assistance,\nparticularly to national plans aimed at eliminating\npoverty in all its dimensions.\nThe Government of the Republic of Yemen is\nfollowing a comprehensive development approach\nunder extremely difficult economic circumstances.\nLarge sums are allocated in the national budget for\nbuilding the infrastructure, and particular importance is\ngiven to multidimensional programmes for the\nelimination of poverty. An effort is being made to\nensure the participation of the various segments of civil\nsociety in the process of decision-making for\ndevelopment activities.\nSeeking integration into the global economy, the\ncompetent authorities in Yemen are endeavouring to\nfulfil the requirements for joining the World Trade\nOrganization. In this context, the Government has\nadopted a number of measures related to economic\nreforms and to finding new markets. However, in that\nregard there are obstacles facing the Republic of\nYemen, as is the case with other least developed\ncountries seeking market integration. An effort must be\nmade to remove these obstacles by allowing access to\nworld markets for Yemen\u2019s products and by affording it\nan opportunity to acquire the technology needed for\ndevelopment, particularly communications and\ninformation technology.\nThe process of globalization, which in its current\nform has some positive elements, should give due\nconsideration to human needs and not be confined to\nmarket interests. Inter-State relations characterized by\njustice and shared responsibility, as envisioned last\nyear in the Millennium Declaration, should prevail.\nWith regard to bilateral economic cooperation,\nmy country\u2019s delegation would like to express its\nthanks and appreciation for the contributions of\nfriendly States \u2014 in particular Germany, the\nNetherlands and Japan - that are providing assistance to\ndevelopment plans and programmes in the Republic of\nYemen.\nThe most important trend in the world today is\nunquestionably the increasing move towards\ndemocracy as a necessary requirement for the\nachievement of equity, justice and social peace. In the\nRepublic of Yemen, the democratic process has been a\nbasis for guaranteeing the unity achieved on 22 May\n1990 and has been organically linked to that unity.\nIn spite of the short time since its achievement of\nunity and its proclamation of commitment to the\ndemocratic process, my country has made major strides\ntowards the achievement of political pluralism, the\npeaceful transfer of power and the guaranteeing of\nhuman rights, especially with regard to the\nparticipation of women in the comprehensive\ndevelopment process. The most recent of these\nachievements were the free direct elections for the\npresidency of the Republic last year and the local\nGovernment elections early this year. Our manifest\ndesire to develop the democratic process led to the\nconvening of the Emerging Democracies Forum in\nSana\u2019a last year, which was the first conference of its\nkind.\nLastly, we would like to express our desire to host\nthe next International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies, scheduled to take place in 2003. We hope\nthat our request will be supported. The Conference will\nprovide an opportunity for participants to get to know\nfirst-hand the country in the land of Sheba \u2014 a country\nthat has practised consultation and democracy since the\ndawn of civilization.\nIn conclusion, I hope that our meetings here will\nresult in the promotion of joint endeavours that fulfil\n31\n\nthe aspirations of our peoples for a world in which\njustice triumphs over inequity and poverty and in\nwhich peace, rather than fear and war, prevails.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI seize this opportunity to\nextend, on behalf of my Government, my warm\ncongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. I am confident that, with his experience and\nprofound dedication, he will successfully guide the\nproceedings of this session. I also avail myself of this\nopportunity to thank his predecessor, His Excellency\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his excellent stewardship of the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. May I also\nextend our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, on his\nelection to a second term and on the award of the\nNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations.\nLast year, at the Millennium Summit held here in\nNew York, the President of Somalia, His Excellency\nMr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan, stood before the\nAssembly after Somalia\u2019s absence from the\ninternational arena for about a decade. That was a\nmoment of historic significance for my country, which\ncontinues to strive to emerge from the abyss of conflict\nand to reassert its position as an active Member of the\nUnited Nations. I reiterate our deep gratitude to the\ninternational community for welcoming us back into\nthe fold.\nIn the last century, humanity witnessed great and\nlaudable achievements in the political, scientific,\ntechnological and economic fields. Yet, despite those\naccomplishments, we continue to face challenges that\nneed to be fully addressed. Conflicts are abundant;\npoverty is rampant; the economic divide between North\nand South continues to widen; and the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS remains unabated in the world. Nations\naround the globe are reeling from the attendant\nconsequences and call for urgent and immediate action.\nThe events of 11 September shocked the\nconscience of all decent human beings. We in Somalia\nrelate to the pain and suffering of the people of the\nUnited States in a very profound and special way. The\nSomali people have been subjected to a reign of terror\nperpetrated by the warlords. We in Somalia, therefore,\nknow very well what it means to lose loved ones. Let\nme say that those who committed the heinous and\n36\n\natrocious crimes of 11 September have nothing in\ncommon with Islam or with the Islamic faith. Islam\npreaches peace within one\u2019s spiritual self and with\none\u2019s neighbours; it preaches tolerance and\ncompassion.\nAllow me to reiterate our heartfelt and sincere\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the\npeople and the Government of the United States of\nAmerica on their tragic loss. We continue to share their\ngrief and pain.\nThe inhuman terrorist attacks of 11 September\nbrought to the forefront new challenges to international\npeace and security. Our fight against terrorism must be\nbased on collective action by the international\ncommunity and on the principles enshrined in the\nCharter of the United Nations. The immediate and\nstrong response by the Security Council and the\nGeneral Assembly, including the adoption of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), reflects our collective\napproach in the fight against terrorism. The\nGovernment of Somalia fully supports Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and is firmly\ncommitted to translate its provisions into action.\nHaving said that, I must observe that terrorists\nwill exploit situations of injustice and imbalance as\nwell as conflicts in fragile and unstable States. The\ninternational community is under a moral obligation to\ncome to the aid of those States in the form of post-\nconflict peace-building and national reconstruction so\nthat they do not become vulnerable to the evil forces of\nterrorism. In that context, we welcome the statement\nmade before the Assembly by His Excellency President\nGeorge W. Bush, in which he expressed the readiness\nof the United States Government to extend assistance\nto those countries that lack adequate resources to\ncombat terrorism. A case in point is the situation in my\ncountry, where there was a political vacuum and no\nGovernment for a decade.\nThe present Somali Government has been in\noffice for about a year and a few months. It is a\nGovernment that inherited destroyed institutions and\ndevastated infrastructure. There are two options before\nthe international community in dealing with the\nsituation in Somalia: watch the country slide back into\nanarchy and chaos or fully support the struggling\nSomali State by providing the necessary resources to\nenable it to play a meaningful role in the fight against\nterrorism. The Somali Government needs urgent and\nadequate assistance from the international community\nto be able to comply with resolution 1373 (2001).\nLet me at this juncture address the persistent\nreports in the media and elsewhere alleging, among\nother things, the existence of terrorist camps in\nSomalia. First, I should firmly state that the Somali\nGovernment hosts no terrorists nor does it offer bases\nor training camps for them. My Government has not\noffered and will not offer them any sanctuary. We will\narrest and hand over immediately any known terrorist\nwho comes to our shores. Secondly, we want to\nchallenge the veracity of these reports. It is also\nimportant to evaluate objectively the integrity of the\nsources of this kind of information.\nWe are a transparent and open society and are\nmore than willing to cooperate fully with the United\nNations and with States in this regard. The Somali\nGovernment is ready to invite the media and other\ninterested parties to visit our country to verify the facts\non the ground. First, we need to see the evidence and\nestablish the facts first. It is a fundamental principle of\nlaw and natural justice that every person is presumed\ninnocent until proven guilty. This principle, in our\nopinion, is equally applicable to States.\nIn view of my Government\u2019s serious concern\nabout these accusations, we propose setting up an\ninternational committee of inquiry under the auspices\nof the United Nations Security Council to investigate\nthese allegations. We also propose that the committee\nidentify Somalia\u2019s needs in regard to the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001). We are fully prepared to cooperate with the\nproposed committee, if established, in the fulfilment of\nits mandate.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Somali Government\nhas been in office for approximately a year and three\nmonths. During this time, the Government has faced\ndaunting challenges, primarily in enhancing security in\nthe capital and others areas. We have succeeded in\ndemobilizing 25,000 militia personnel. We have\nestablished police stations and deployed 3,000 police\nofficers in the capital. A judiciary system has been put\nin place, courts are functioning, and the Government is\ncollecting taxes for the first time in a decade.\nThe Somali Government continues to search for a\nlasting peace in Somalia through dialogue with those\n37\n\noutside the Arta process. This is in conformity with the\nTransitional National Charter and resolutions adopted\nby regional, subregional and international\norganizations, as well as the presidential statements of\nthe Security Council on Somalia.\nIn this regard, let me also refer to the numerous\nimportant initiatives that have been launched to\npromote national reconciliation and peace in Somalia.\nWe extend our profound thanks and appreciation to all\nthose countries that have contributed to the search for\npeace in Somalia.\nLet me, in this regard, pay special tribute to\nPresident of the Republic of Djibouti, Mr. Ismail Omar\nGuelleh, and Government of Djibouti for their\nsignificant, continuous and positive contribution to the\nnational reconciliation process. I would also like to\nthank Mr. Omer Al-Bashir, President of the Sudan and\nthe current chairman of the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), for his consistent\nsupport for Somalia and the search for a lasting peace\nin my country. The United Nations, the Organization of\nAfrican Unity, the League of Arab States and IGAD\ncontinue to play a positive role in this regard, for which\nwe thank them.\nFinally, I want to express, on behalf of my\nPresident, our thanks to President Daniel arap Moi for\nhis recent efforts in bringing peace to Somalia.\nPresident Moi\u2019s latest initiative was the recent meeting\nheld in Nairobi last month. The meeting brought\ntogether the President of Somalia and some of the\nopposition groups. A joint communiqu\u00e9 was signed,\nstipulating the principles upon which future talks could\nbe based. We expect a broader-based meeting to be\nheld soon.\nIn conclusion, let me once again emphasize that\nSomalia is a struggling country working toward\nachieving peace. This country needs massive assistance\nfor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of its\ninfrastructure and institutions. We urgently need the\nassistance and goodwill of the international\ncommunity. It is my sincere hope that the international\ncommunity will respond positively and in a timely\nmanner to our appeal for urgent and immediate\nassistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is a fitting tribute that that Prize,\ndedicated to the cause of peace and so richly earned by\nour Secretary-General in his own right and by the\nUnited Nations Organization collectively, has been\nconferred on them this year.

As a member of the Council, we\nassert, with particular emphasis and deliberation, our\nunwavering commitment to the cause of ending this\npernicious evil.\nTo defeat the forces of terror, our collective\naction must be firm, decisive and broad-based.\nInternational law must become a binding framework\nfor the total defeat of terrorism. Jamaica welcomes the\nongoing efforts to elaborate a draft comprehensive\nconvention against terrorism. We hope that during this\nsession of the General Assembly the momentum will\nbe seized to achieve measurable progress in this critical\narea. At the same time, the international community\nneeds to take action aimed at achieving the universality\nof the existing conventions and other instruments\nagainst terrorism.\nJamaica is accelerating its domestic action to\nachieve those objectives, and this morning I was\npleased to sign the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\nFor the past two years, Jamaica has worked with\nother members of the Council to make peacekeeping\noperations more efficient; to create strategies for\nsustained peace-building; to bring warring factions to\nthe peace table and, beyond that, to promote\ncompliance with resulting accords; and to put in place\nmechanisms for protecting those most affected by\nsituations of conflict, especially the women and\nchildren.\nWe are pleased with the work already undertaken\nin respect of the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\noperations. Through a number of tribunals, we have\ndemonstrated that the United Nations will act to end\nimpunity. Despite sustained international efforts,\nhowever, several flashpoints still remain.\nJamaica is deeply concerned about the continuing\ncycle of violence and reprisal in the Middle East.\nEfforts to achieve a durable ceasefire have been\nthwarted at every turn. Numerous resolutions of the\nSecurity Council have been ignored. We recognize the\npositive efforts of some permanent members to\ninfluence a return to the peace process, but the Security\nCouncil should not be marginalized in these initiatives.\nJamaica again urges the Government of Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority to spare no effort in complying\nwith agreements already reached. We call on both\nparties to remain engaged in the quest for a durable\npeace.\nWe dare not neglect the millions of children\nworldwide who suffer from hunger, disease and\nignorance. In situations of conflict, children are the\nmost vulnerable victims. We have all been horrified by\ntheir exploitation as child soldiers and by the\ntrafficking and sexual abuse that numerous children\nhave suffered. We have to remember that they\nconstitute the generation of tomorrow, in whose hands\nwill rest the future of international peace and security.\n21\n\nNor must we forget the importance of\nhumanitarian assistance to the innocent people in\nconflict-torn areas of the world and to refugees and\ndisplaced persons, as well as to those who are victims\nof natural and man-made disasters. For them, the\nUnited Nations must become a beacon of hope for the\npeace and stability that will enable them to lead normal\nand productive lives.\nMilitary strikes cannot by themselves eradicate\nterrorism. In our response, we need to be mindful that\nthe time has come for us to inaugurate a new era of\npeace \u2014 not simply through preventing war, but by\neliminating the causes that give rise to strife and\nviolence. And so I stand at this rostrum today to call\nfor a United Nations renaissance, for a rebirth of this\nOrganization, which will not just permit it to be the\nharbinger of peace, but which will empower it to foster\na climate that will usher in a new age of global\ndevelopment and a dynamic partnership for human\nprosperity.\nWe are living in a time of fear, not just in this\ncountry or here in this city, but worldwide: fear for the\nlives of people; fear for the state of economies,\nnational and global; fear that our propensity for wanton\ndestruction may impair the capacity of the planet itself\nto sustain life. These fears are compounded by other\nblights \u2014 the blights of disease, ignorance and bigotry\ntowards people on the basis of ethnicity, religion and\ngender; the blight of cruel and autocratic governance in\nsome places; and, most pervasive of all, the blight of\npoverty.\nThe expansion of the global economy in the last\nfour decades has not eliminated gross poverty or even\nreduced its prevalence. A sophisticated, globalized,\nincreasingly affluent world currently co-exists, globally\nand within countries, with a marginalized underclass.\nThe hungry, the homeless and the destitute are\nless impassioned about the physical insecurities of\nterrorist repression or the damaging consequences of\nmilitary warfare. The unemployed, those who are ill\nbut have no health care, those who are cold but have no\nproper heating, those who are old but have no social\nsupport \u2014 for these victims, \u201csecurity\u201d means a meal,\na roof, a job, medicine, warmth and relief from poverty\nin general. But those needs are just as real and\ninsistent, and they represent for them the most\nimmediate denial of their rights as human beings.\nDuring the last decade, the process of\nglobalization, deregulation and privatization has swept\nthe world. It is incontrovertible that it has not been a\ngolden age for a large proportion of the world\u2019s people:\nnot just for the 1.3 billion absolute poor in developing\ncountries whom the benefits of globalization seem to\nhave bypassed, but for many millions in industrial\ncountries also. We delude ourselves if we believe that\nall those engaged in street protests, whether in Seattle,\nWashington, Prague, Quebec city or Rome, are simply\nanarchists.\nInternational institutions must not only be\naccountable; they must be subject to democratic\ngovernance as well. It is becoming more widely\nrecognized that a new global institutional architecture\nis needed to establish representative superintendence of\nthe global economy, directed towards enlargement of\nsocial and economic justice worldwide and targeted to\na sharp redirection of the numbers mired in gross\npoverty and deprivation.\nSome of the desired progress may be possible\nthrough existing institutions, but more radical reform\nmay also be required. Democratic superintendence of\nthe global economy has to be a central feature of the\nfresh global architecture we seek to fashion during this\ndecade. That new global architecture must incorporate\nappropriate arrangements for a start to be made in\nraising global resources for global purposes in ways\nthat do not generate alarm. The persistence of gross\npoverty, the long list of environmental abuses, the\ndisturbing reduction in development aid and the\nvagaries of foreign private investment make a\ncompelling case for global revenues.\nThe world faces crucial choices. We have to\nidentify and follow a guiding principle if humanity is\nto make an enlightened response to the challenges we\nface. We can hardly return to the principles of a feudal\nworld in which military and economic strength are\nconcentrated in the hands of a few, while we indulge in\nan illusion of order through the marginalization of the\nmany. In our interdependent, interconnected world, that\nis no longer a credible option.\nOur only way forward lies here in the United\nNations. If this institution did not exist before 11\nSeptember, we would have to create it now. We have to\nbe inspired by the vision that propelled the generation\nof 1945 to pursue the path of collective responsibility\nfor peace and human progress through a regime of\n22\n\nmultilateral action anchored by the United Nations. It\nwas coterie of Governments, in a rare moment of\ncollective wisdom and creativity, that settled the United\nNations Charter. It was not without flaws in its\ninception, and some flaws have remained to hobble its\ncapacity to initiate the renaissance of which I speak.\nIt is within that context that the demand for the\nreform of the Security Council becomes even more\nurgent, since the Council\u2019s present design and\nfunctioning weaken its capacity to fulfil its mandate.\nWe must remove all existing constraints on the capacity\nof the United Nations. Even as we work to improve it\nand to reform it, we must proclaim the United Nations\nto be the temple in which we can all worship. \u201cWe, the\npeople\u201d must be made a reality to fulfil the\ncommitment made in their name by the Charter of\n1945.\nToday, our greatest hope lies in people: in people\nof all races, of all genders, of all faiths; people of all\ncontinents and oceans; people of all ages; the\n\u201cordinary\u201d people of the world and those who hold\nthemselves to be of higher station. All the world\u2019s\npeople are affected by the calamities that loom; all\nmust be involved in turning humanity away from\ngloom and in finding the light.\nThe Charter does not set out the principal organs\nof the United Nations in a hierarchical order, but the\nGeneral Assembly is the only principal organ under the\nCharter that embraces all the Members on a one\nmember, one vote basis. It is the symbol of the United\nNations as a universal organization in the best\ndemocratic tradition. And so, I believe that it is within\nthe General Assembly that the true renaissance of the\nUnited Nations must begin. The special value of the\nGeneral Assembly is its universality, its capacity to be\na forum in which the voice of every Member State can\nbe raised. It provides the opportunity for countries to\nventilate issues, to bring complaints to the floor in the\ngeneral debate and to suggest new ideas in committees.\nBut the assumption surely must be valid that\ndeliberation should inform action.\nHigh among the changes that should mark the\nrenaissance of the United Nations is the revitalization\nof the General Assembly as a universal forum of the\nworld\u2019s States. Even with a reformed and somewhat\nenlarged Security Council, many Member States with a\ncapacity to contribute significantly to the policies and\nprogrammes of the United Nations and to global\ngovernance will have to remain on the sidelines. A\nGeneral Assembly that occupies more of the stage and\nreorders its work to make it more focused and more\nresult-oriented, will allow each of us a meaningful role\nin world governance through our work in the\nAssembly. It is in the interest of the world community\nto have a more vigorous and effective General\nAssembly which can and should play a vital\nlegitimating role in the United Nations, consonant with\nthe universality of its membership.\nHere in the General Assembly, we are the\npractitioners of international affairs. At the heart of the\nconduct of those affairs must lie a sense of realism. I\ntoo am conscious that the accumulated baggage of\ndecades cannot be shed in a single heave. That is why I\ndo not call for reform but advocate instead a\nrenaissance: a rebirth which offers the chance of facing\nthe twenty-first century with sound values no longer\npredicated on a world of adversarial States but on an\ninteractive world of people that has espoused\nneighbourhood values of respect for life and liberty, for\njustice and equity, for tolerance and caring; values that\nbalance rights with responsibilities, that elevate the\ndemocratic ethic at both the national and the global\nlevels.\nWe are a long way from that consummation,\nhowever devoutly we may wish it. But we are\nsufficiently frightened by the prospects that confront us\nto recognize the need for humanity to take \u201cthe path\nless travelled by\u201d. There are enough good people in all\nour societies \u2014 who together are the silent majority of\nthe world\u2019s people \u2014 to ensure that by choosing this\nnew path we can indeed make a real difference. We\nhave to find a better way than the one a divided world\nhas been pursuing. That way has to lie through the\nUnited Nations as an organization \u2014 but a United\nNations revitalized, its agencies repaired, reformed and\nresponsive to a culture of new values appropriate to our\ntime.\nThis new era of global relations demands bolder\nand more ingenious approaches to confidence-building\nand to development as a prerequisite for international\npeace and security. An equitable framework to finance\nnational and global development, to fuel expansion of\ninternational trade and to foster sustainable\ndevelopment must be placed on the front burner,\nwhether we gather in Qatar, in Mexico or in South\nAfrica.\n23\n\nIf the global conferences to be held in those three\nplaces are to succeed, Member States must be guided\nby full recognition that this new era of global relations\ndemands, as I said, more ingenious approaches to\nconfidence-building and to development as a\nprecondition for international peace and security.\nIn closing, I wish to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his assumption of the\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly and\nto commit Jamaica\u2019s total support for the attainment of\nour common goals in the service of all humankind.\nWhatever may be our colour, culture or creed, we\nbelong to a single race \u2014 that is, the human race. We\noccupy a single planet, which has more than enough to\nenable each person and every nation to enjoy the\nabundance which Mother Earth has to offer and for all\nits people to dwell together in harmony.\nNow more than at any time in its history, the\nUnited Nations is the best vehicle to procure global\npeace and to foster international cooperation. Let this,\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, loudly\nand clearly proclaim that the renaissance of the United\nNations has indeed begun.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nam delighted to be able to congratulate you, Sir, on\nbehalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of\nMauritania, on your election to the presidency of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are\ncertain that your experience and wisdom will indeed\nguarantee success at this session.\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express\nmy gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\nfor his skilful and distinguished guidance of the work\nof the past session. This is also an opportunity for me\nto extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral and the entire United Nations staff on their\ntireless efforts to achieve the noble objectives of our\nOrganization. Those efforts have quite rightly been\nrecognized by the Nobel Academy, which decided to\naward the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the\nSecretary-General and the United Nations. This\ndistinction reflects the most striking recognition of the\nefforts undertaken by our Organization to strengthen\ninternational peace and security. It also constituted\nrecognition of the personal merits and contributions of\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. Moreover, the\nre-election of the Secretary-General to a second term\nreflected the satisfaction of the international\ncommunity.\nThis session is taking place in a climate of\nsadness in the aftermath of the criminal attacks on New\nYork and on Washington, D.C., with their heavy toll of\nthousands of innocent lives. The moment they were\nperpetrated, Mauritania voiced its absolute\ncondemnation of those terrorist acts. My country\nreaffirms its condolences to the people and the\nGovernment of the United States. These tragic events\nhave cast light on a new situation: terrorism is no\nlonger a marginal phenomenon but is rather a key\nproblem that knows no boundaries and that can be\ncombated only by means of a global strategy.\nMauritania continues to be an active participant in all\nregional and international activities aimed at a\nconcerted and comprehensive fight against that\nphenomenon. In that context, we reaffirm our\nunreserved support for all relevant resolutions, along\nwith our determination, specifically, to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\nSeptember.\nIt is obvious that the role and international\nlegitimacy of the United Nations in bringing about\ninternational peace, security and stability must be\nenhanced. No one must suggest that fighting terrorism\nis a campaign by one civilization against another, or\nthe supposed supremacy of one civilization over any\nother. To the contrary, we must act together to show\nthat the endeavour to eliminate terrorism marks a new\nphase in humankind\u2019s march forward, building on the\nheritage of all civilizations and converging in an\n17\n\nexpression of our common aspiration to a secure life\nand a better future.\nIn that connection, my country notes with\nsatisfaction the sustained efforts and the success of\nrepeated appeals to bring peace to the Middle East so\nthat the peoples of that region can live in peace,\nsecurity and prosperity. We hope that the peace process\nwill be resumed in accordance with the principles\nenunciated at the Madrid Conference, in keeping with\nthe principle of land for peace, and in conformity with\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\nand 425 (1978), thus bringing about the complete\nwithdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied\nin 1967 and the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State with its capital in the holy city of Al-\nQuds Al-Sharif.\nWe express our hope for a return to stability and\nconcord in the Gulf region, consistent with\ninternational legality and with respect for the\nindependence and territorial integrity of Kuwait, as\nwell as with respect for the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq. In that context, we call for the lifting\nof the embargo that has been imposed for more than 10\nyears on the fraternal Iraqi people, who have suffered\nimmensely from that embargo.\nWith respect to Western Sahara, my country\nsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General and of his\nPersonal Envoy, Mr. James A. Baker III, to guarantee\nstability in the area through a final solution that would\nenjoy the support of all parties concerned.\nTurning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis,\nwe welcome the success of diplomatic initiatives, but\nat the same time feel that the Security Council should\nact to lift the embargo imposed on Libya.\nWe hail everything that has been done to resolve\nconflicts and wars on the African continent, which\nhave stymied development efforts there. We welcome\nthe recent all-Africa development initiative and the\nsupport it has won from our development partners in\nterms, inter alia, of sources of financing.\nIt has now been proven that phenomena such as\nviolence and extremism are the outgrowth of poverty\nand frustration. The international community must\ntherefore go further to demonstrate its solidarity and\nhelp achieve social development throughout the world.\nDeveloping countries hope for a greater, more reliable\nspirit of solidarity that is expressed in deeds. They\nneed increased support from the rich countries in the\nform of greater investment and the opening up of\ninternational markets to products from the developing\nworld.\nWe must recall too that debt continues to be\namong the major obstacles to progress in the\neconomies of developing countries and a handicap to\neconomic development.\nNotwithstanding the scope of the challenges and\nthe unfavourable international situation, the Islamic\nRepublic of Mauritania, under the enlightened\nleadership of His Excellency President Maaouya Ould\nSid\u2019 Ahmed Taya, has made major strides towards\nsustainable development, with a view to improving the\nstandard of living of our people, achieving social\nadvancement and consolidating democracy and the rule\nof law in a climate of peace, security and stability.\nPluralistic democracy has been restored in full with the\nholding some weeks ago of our fifth municipal\nelections and our third legislative elections. Among the\nlatest reforms are the introduction of proportional\nrepresentation, which has made possible the\ninvolvement of all parties and which has expanded the\nvoter base and involvement in political life. Observers\nand opposition parties praised the conduct and the\noutcome of the elections. The broadest possible\nparticipation by the people is the best guarantee of\nsuccess in the fight against poverty, illiteracy and\nexclusion. This has strengthened our conviction that\ntrue enjoyment of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms depends on the ability of the people to take\npart in economic, social and cultural decisions.\nA purpose of the Charter of the United Nations is\nto realize our common goals. Now more than ever, we\nmust make an effort to live up to our Charter\ncommitments in order to bring about a new world\nbased on law and justice, guaranteeing peace, security\nand solidarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of\nall, I would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on\nhis election as President of this fifty-sixth session of\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations. Likewise,\nI would like to congratulate the Organization itself and\nits Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on having been\nawarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Annan's\nre-election guarantees the continuous leadership of\nsomeone who has enormously contributed to\nstrengthening the prestige of the United Nations and its\nrole in the world.\nI also wish to emphasize my full support for the\nstatement made in this Hall by the Minister for Foreign\n32\n\nAffairs of Belgium on behalf of the presidency of the\nEuropean Union.\nThe horror of the terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember shocked the world. We were all attacked on\nthat day  all of us who defend freedom, tolerance and\nrespect for the dignity of human beings. Spain knows\nwell the cruelty of terrorism and the grief that it can\ncause. Therefore, Spain, its Government and its\ncitizens are in complete solidarity with the American\npeople, the families of the victims and this city of New\nYork, which is also our city  the city of the United\nNations.\nOnce again, I wish to express my solidarity and\nmy condolences to the families of the victims of\ntoday's tragedy.\nAfter 11 September, we cannot continue acting in\nthe same way. There has been change in the political\nparadigm  the coordinates that have guided us until\nnow. The paradigm has changed, and now the political\nculture must also change. Terrorism cannot continue to\nbe regarded as an inevitable evil for our peoples, but\nrather as a mortal enemy of them all. There can be\nneither excuses nor pretexts: this is the time to\ndemonstrate the political will of each and every one of\nus to take effective measures for international\ncooperation against terrorism  measures which Spain\nhas been promoting for years  to take a qualitative\nleap forward.\nSince 11 September, an important international\nconsensus has emerged on the need to confront\nterrorism. This shows that terrorism has nothing to do\nwith the differences between North and South or East\nand West, much less with a supposed conflict between\ncivilizations. Many Islamic countries are among its\nmain victims. It does have to do, however, with the\ndifference between those who commit these kinds of\nacts or give them their support, and those who consider\nthem to be atrocities and violations of the most\nelementary principles of human coexistence, which are\ncommon to all the great civilizations.\nThe United Nations has risen to the occasion. Its\naction has been quick and effective, demonstrating that\nthe Organization is indispensable at the dawning of the\nnew millennium. Resolution 1368 (2001) made it\npossible for a coalition of wills, of which Spain is a\npart, to emerge in order to respond to the attacks.\nResolution 1373 (2001) expresses the determination of\nthe international community to maintain concerted\naction for as long as necessary against terrorism:\nagainst terrorism without adjectives, against the\nterrorists themselves, and also against those who lend\nthem any type of support, active or passive.\nProgress has also been made in the negotiation of\na general convention against international terrorism,\novercoming some of the obstacles that had blocked the\nnegotiations for years. Now that we are close to\nreaching an agreement, we must make an effort to\neliminate the problems that are still pending. The goal\nmust be to draw up an operative and effective\ninstrument against terrorism that cannot be paralysed\nby interminable discussions of a political rather than a\nlegal nature. The subject is of pivotal importance, and\nthe very credibility of the United Nations is at stake.\nWe have a historical opportunity before us; it would be\na shame if we were to squander it.\nTo their cynicism and disdain for elementary\nhuman values, terrorists often add a shameless\nopportunism in order to manipulate particular\nsituations to their advantage. These situations\nundoubtedly require a solution on account of their\nintrinsic nature, on their own merits, without any\nrelation to terrorist claims. We must all work together\nto find that solution.\nThese situations involve structural problems such\nas poverty and the marginalization in which many\nmillions of people live all over the world. They also\nhave to do with regional conflicts, such as that in the\nMiddle East, where there is an urgent need to stop the\nblind cycle of violence and return to the negotiating\ntable. If the political will exists, negotiations are\npossible. Madrid, Oslo and the advances made at Camp\nDavid and Taba prove this. There is no alternative to\nthe peace process and, at the end of the road, the State\nof Israel and the Palestinian State will coexist\npeacefully within secure borders.\nTerrorist attacks against innocent civilians cause\nalarm among our peoples, but they are not the only\ncause for uncertainty at the beginning of the new\nmillennium.\nWhen the political and ideological confrontations\nthat had defined the second half of the twentieth\ncentury were largely overcome, other types of conflicts\nemerged with force. These tend to be not international,\nbut rather internal, conflicts and are therefore difficult\nto address with the instruments of traditional\n33\n\ndiplomacy. Some of them have given rise to serious\nhumanitarian crises that have afflicted our peoples.\nAt a time when we have decoded the human\ngenome and the advances of biotechnology pose new\ndilemmas, millions of people continue to live in\nconditions of extreme poverty, with less than a dollar\nper day to cover all their needs.\nAs we witness the interconnection of economies\nworldwide and can send information instantly to any\ncorner of the Earth, we see how globalization\ndistributes its benefits unequally, making more visible\nand intolerable the breach between rich and poor, the\npowerful and the weak, the haves and the have-nots.\nThese situations give rise to uncertainty, but they\nalso give rise to a demand for solutions. Our peoples\nturn to us  Governments and international\norganizations  and they ask us to act, especially the\nUnited Nations. Its global vision, its universal\ncomposition and its vocation to defend the interests of\nall humanity give it a unique legitimacy in the eyes of\nour citizens.\nIn order not to disappoint these expectations, the\nUnited Nations must face the challenge of its\nmodernization, following the path charted by the\nMillennium Summit.\nMy country has also undergone a significant\nprocess of modernization in recent years, which has\nenabled it to become fully incorporated into\ninternational life. Spain has been able to break away\nfrom the inertia of the past and seek new solutions to\nits new problems. It has done so without renouncing its\nidentity as a bridge between different cultures and\nregions of the world. That is the perspective from\nwhich my country backs the process of reform and\nmodernization. It will continue to do so from the\npresidency of the European Union, which it will hold\nduring the first half of next year.\nThe phenomenon of globalization is responsible\nfor much of the current uncertainty facing the\nprocesses of change. The United Nations, which thinks\nglobally, is the natural forum for managing\nglobalization.\nIn addition to the fight against terrorism, effective\ninstruments must be developed to combat drugs and\ntransnational organized crime. This year, progress must\nbe made in the preparation of a convention against\ncorruption.\nThe International Criminal Court is one of the\nkey instruments of international relations that we will\nneed in the new millennium. Spain has been involved\nfrom the start in the fight against the culture of\nimpunity with regard to the most heinous crimes. It\nnow seems more necessary than ever for the Court to\nstart to act. The different legal systems of the world\nmust be duly represented in the court, because\nglobalization does not mean homogenization. No\ncountry must be marginalized from this historic\nprocess; all must be able to contribute to the Court\ntheir own views regarding international criminal\njustice.\nArms control, disarmament and non-proliferation\nrequire greater attention from the international\ncommunity. Progress in the destruction and prohibition\nof anti-personnel mines as a result of the Ottawa\nConvention and the results of the Programme of Action\nof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects are\nencouraging.\nThe need to protect the environment is real, and\nthe solutions cannot be postponed. The Kyoto Protocol\noffers some answers to this problem. Those who do not\naccept Kyoto will have to propose a better solution. In\nthe meantime, its ratification will be the only practical\nmeasure taken in this field. That is why we welcome\nthe agreement reached in Marrakech, which we believe\nto be a step in the right direction.\nNew conflicts require new solutions. We must\ndeal with all the stages of a particular conflict through\na comprehensive approach that includes efforts to\nprevent the causes, to keep the peace when crisis\nerupts, to consolidate that peace and, afterwards, to\nbegin economic and institutional reconstruction. This\nidea has inspired the efforts being made by my country,\nin cooperation with the Russian Federation, in the\ndemining project in southern Lebanon. It also\nmotivates efforts, in which Spain is an active\nparticipant, to strengthen African capabilities to\nprevent and settle conflicts. For that reason, Spain was\nvery pleased to welcome the birth of the African Union\nat the Lusaka Summit, as well as the New African\nInitiative that was adopted there.\nThis approach must also be applied to\ninternational action in support of the Afghan people,\nwhose situation is particularly dire. We must urgently\nhelp them to meet their basic humanitarian needs,\n34\n\nespecially given the approach of winter. This\ninternational action, to which Spain is contributing,\nmust also include clear support for the economic and\ninstitutional reconstruction of the country. The future\nof Afghanistan is something that only the Afghan\npeople can decide. Nevertheless, the international\ncommunity must support them so that they can\nestablish a stable Government and maintain normal\nrelations with their neighbours and the rest of the\nworld. In this task, the United Nations must play a\nfundamental role.\nThe new diplomatic instruments that are required\nmust accord special attention to humanitarian affairs.\nThe need to protect the rights of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons, access to humanitarian assistance\nfor affected populations and the situation of children in\narmed conflicts, in addition to the security problem of\nUnited Nations and associated personnel  all these\nissues require effective solutions. If some States fail to\nmeet their responsibilities in this area, it will be\nnecessary to draw attention to their attitude repeatedly,\nuntil it changes.\nPeacekeeping is an essential instrument in this\ncomprehensive approach to dealing with conflict. The\nGeneral Assembly must take concrete steps to\nimplement the recommendations of the Brahimi report\non peacekeeping operations by increasing the size of\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the\nSecretariat, improving the participation of the troop-\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process\nand strengthening civil police operations, in which\nSpain has played an active role.\nNone of this will be enough if peacekeeping\noperations do not receive clear and adequate mandates,\nbacked with the firm political support of the Security\nCouncil. If mandates are not clear and adequate, it will\nnot be possible to send United Nations units to places\nin which they may have to use force. No country is\nprepared to risk the lives of its soldiers to defend\nempty words.\nThis brings us to the need to conclude the process\nof reforming the Security Council. We need a more\nrepresentative, democratic, effective and transparent\nSecurity Council. Spain, which is a candidate for\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council in\nthe elections to be held during the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly, will strive, if elected, to\nincrease the quantity and improve the quality of the\nconsultations with non-member States, especially with\nthose most affected by the issues being debated by the\nCouncil.\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms  civil\nand political, as well as economic and social  are the\nbirthright of all humanity and not just of a particular\ngroup of States. Their violation today provokes\ncondemnation in a way that it did not in the past. We\nmust continue to strengthen such points of agreement,\nincorporating the concerns of all.\nIt is therefore important that the Durban\nConference was able to adopt a final document. Spain,\nlike the rest of the European Union, upheld to the end\nits commitment to the objectives of the Conference. We\nmust take advantage of the agreement reached at\nDurban to continue to make progress in this field.\nAlong the same lines, my country will organize, in the\nnext few days in Madrid, in cooperation with the Office\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights, an international consultative conference on\nstudent education in relation to freedom of religion or\nbeliefs, tolerance and non-discrimination.\nI cannot fail to refer to the question of Gibraltar.\nAs has already been communicated to the Secretary-\nGeneral, the United Kingdom and Spain agreed, on 26\nJuly in London, to relaunch their talks within the\nframework of the Brussels Declaration, issuing to this\nend a communiqu\u00c8 in which they underlined their\npolitical will to overcome all of their differences over\nGibraltar and to conclude these talks promptly and\nsuccessfully for the benefit of all the parties involved.\nFurthermore, they invited the Chief Minister of\nGibraltar to participate in ministerial meetings within\nthe framework of this process.\nThe problem of development is central to the\nactivities of the Organization. The Millennium\nDeclaration constitutes the basic framework for these\nactivities and must be implemented in its entirety. At\nthis session, the General Assembly must set in motion\nan effective monitoring mechanism for the Declaration.\nSpain is also working to define new fields for\ndevelopment cooperation. For example, Spain is a\npioneer in the development of microcredits, which\nconstitute a particularly suitable instrument for the\ndevelopment of the less advanced countries. This year,\nSpain organized in Las Palmas a high-level meeting on\ntourism and development in less developed countries\nwith a view to placing its extensive experience in this\n35\n\nfield at the service of tourism development in such\ncountries, some of which, such as the small island\nStates, have comparative advantages in this field from\nwhich they could benefit.\nNext April, Spain will also organize the Second\nWorld Assembly on Ageing, thus responding to the\nneed to pay special attention to vulnerable\npopulations  those most likely to suffer the highest\nrates of poverty. The eradication of poverty is the\nprimary objective of both the Millennium Declaration\nand Spain's policy for cooperation in development.\nIf there is one group of people who are vulnerable\nby definition, it is people who are ill. The special\nsession of General Assembly on AIDS and other\ninfectious diseases highlighted the urgency of halting\ntheir spread. Spain will make a major contribution to\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\nMalaria, which has been created for this purpose.\nThe United Nations will not be able to\naccomplish all of these tasks if it does not have the\nnecessary resources to do so. The budget for the\ncoming two-year period will be discussed during this\nAssembly's session. The effort to impose budgetary\ndiscipline must continue, but rigid positions that\nprevent the Organization from facing up to its\nresponsibilities must be avoided.\nEvading responsibility is something that the\nUnited Nations cannot afford to do, especially today.\nUnique legitimacy imposes a unique responsibility. The\nUnited Nations will be judged in this new millennium\nby its effectiveness in addressing the new problems\nconfronting it, by its ability to transform uncertainties\ninto solutions, insecurity into confidence and fear into\nhope.\nIn conclusion, I would like to make one further\ncomment. In his statement, the Minister for Foreign\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco\nreferred to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and\nto other Spanish territories. In the context of the\nrelations of friendship and good-neighbourliness that\nexist between Spain and Morocco, I wish to stress that\nthe cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and the adjacent\nislands, are an integral part of the territory of Spain and\nthat their citizens are represented in the Spanish\nparliament in the same capacity and under the same\nterms as the rest of their compatriots.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof the President of the Republic of Haiti and of the\nHaitian delegation, I should like at the outset to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. You may rest assured of the full support of the\nHaitian delegation as you carry out your functions.\nI should also like to pay tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, on the efficacy and\ntalent he displayed in conducting the work of the\nMillennium Assembly.\nAllow me furthermore to offer my warmest\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\nto the Organization on their receiving the Nobel Peace\nPrize. Above and beyond any other consideration, this\nreflects recognition of the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Organization to promote peace and\ndevelopment.\nI also take this opportunity to convey, on behalf\nof the people and Government of Haiti, our sincere\ncondolences to the bereaved families, and in particular\nto the Government and brotherly people of the\nDominican Republic, following the tragic aeroplane\naccident in Queens, New York, on 12 November.\n2\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Haiti firmly\ncondemns the hateful acts carried out on 11 September\nin Manhattan, New York, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania, which claimed thousands of victims. On\nthis occasion, the Government offers its solidarity to\nthe American people and Government and its support\nin the fight against terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, wherever it may occur and whomever\nits perpetrators, victims and promoters may be. These\ninhuman and blind acts, while eliciting grief and\ndespair, attack the very underpinnings of the\ndemocratic system and do violence to international\npeace and security, freedom, human rights and the\nsearch for well-being and prosperity.\nThe international community already has at its\ndisposal 10 conventions, complemented by two\nprotocols, addressing terrorism in its various\nmanifestations, not to mention two additional\ninitiatives under consideration on the issue. The\ninternational legal instruments were recently\nstrengthened by Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), which provides the major guidelines for our\ncommon struggle. We all stand to gain by adhering to\ninternational legality. In that vein, the Haitian\nGovernment, notwithstanding its meagre resources, is\ncommitted to taking the measures necessary to ratify\nand implement these relevant legal instruments.\nThese legal instruments are indispensable to our\ncommon struggle against this scourge, to be sure, but it\nis also of the utmost importance that we begin to\nconsider the social, economic, political and other\nfactors that might spawn terrorism. The international\ncommunity, under the auspices of the United Nations\nand the banner of tolerance and solidarity, must build a\ngrand coalition against poverty, ignorance, want,\nhunger, social exclusion and marginalization. That task\nis more urgent now than ever.\nIt is time for the members of the international\ncommunity to reach a consensus on Security Council\nreform. It is necessary to increase the number of the\nCouncil\u2019s permanent members on the basis of better\ngeographic distribution. We must undertake an in-depth\nre-evaluation of the right of veto, the current form of\nwhich is barely relevant to international relations and\nthe exigencies of the democratic imperative. We must\nalso institutionalize transparency in the Council\u2019s\nworking methods and procedures. The achievement of\nthese goals will make the Organization more effective\nand strengthen its legitimacy and authority.\nThe Republic of Haiti urges States and peoples in\nconflict, especially in the Middle East, to embrace\ndialogue in order to find lasting peace.\nToday, in a world led by financial markets, trade\nexchanges and investments of unprecedented scope, a\nnumber of developing countries are being marginalized\nfrom world economic developments. We must\nrefashion cooperation for development if we wish to\nreverse their slide into marginalization and extreme\npoverty. We must, in partnership with the international\ncommunity and all the actors concerned, revise our\nstrategies and propose a common approach that will\ntackle the problem of inequality during the new\nmillennium.\nThus, we are afforded the opportunity to\nimplement all the commitments undertaken by our\nheads of State and Government during the Millennium\nSummit. More than 147 heads of State and Government\nsolemnly committed themselves to deliver humanity\nfrom want, and to make the right to development a\nreality for all. It is incumbent on us to translate these\ncommitments into concrete deeds.\nThe benefits of trade for development are\nrecognized, but it is perhaps still necessary to ask\nourselves if in the context of globalization the least\ndeveloped countries do not find themselves in a\ndilemma. How can we seriously speak of free trade\nwith countries that, for the most part, have little to\ntrade. It is also necessary to increase their production\nand export capacities.\nIt is essential that these countries have access to\nmarkets where they can sell their products. There is the\n\u201cEverything but arms\u201d initiative of the European\nCommission, which we welcome, and we invite our\ndeveloping country partners to do the same.\nThe Haitian Government welcomes the holding of\nthe Conference on Financing for Development, which\nwill take place during the first quarter of 2002 in\nMonterrey, Mexico. That Conference gives us the\nopportunity to formulate recommendations on the\nreorientation of cooperation for development, in\nparticular concrete measures in the area of debt\nmanagement, technological cooperation, trade,\ninvestment and the international financial system. The\nHaitian Government also welcomes the organizing of\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development, which\nwill take place next September in Johannesburg, and\ninvites its partners to accept this concept of\n3\n\npartnership, in which the interlocutors hold dialogues\nas equals in a framework of mutual respect.\nMy Government reaffirms its faith in a\ndemocratic future for Haiti, and, out of conviction, will\ndo everything necessary to consolidate and strengthen\nthe rule of law. Democracy will thus remain one of the\npillars of the Haitian Government\u2019s policies.\nHaiti is now undergoing a crisis situation, which\nis the result of an electoral controversy. In fact, after\nthe elections of 21 May 2000 for the reconstitution of\nthe Chamber of Deputies, more than two thirds of the\nSenate and all of our local offices, the electoral\nobserver mission of the Organization of American\nStates (OAS), while acknowledging in a report that the\nelections took place in an acceptable and credible way,\nstill uncovered certain irregularities in the way that the\nabsolute majority required for the election of the eight\ncandidates to the Senate had been calculated. What\nfollowed was the suspension of international\nassistance, the resumption of which is still conditional\non resolving the post-electoral crisis.\nAs soon as he was elected, and even before his\ninauguration, Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\ncommitted himself to the path of dialogue, convinced\nthat opposition is necessary for the proper functioning\nof institutions. It was in this context that President\nAristide\u2019s eight-point letter of December 2000 was sent\nto the then President of the United States, Mr. William\nJefferson Clinton. In fact, in his search for a negotiated\nsolution, President Aristide encouraged initiatives on\nthe part of sectors of civil society.\nIn addition, during the participation of the Haitian\ndelegation at the Quebec Summit, where the member\nStates of the OAS took note of the efforts made by the\nGovernment, our head of State reiterated once again his\ndetermination to find a negotiated solution to the crisis\nin Haiti.\nOnce again, in Costa Rica, during the twenty-first\nsession of the OAS General Assembly in June 2001,\nPresident Aristide, in a letter to the President of the\nAssembly made proposals that were incorporated into a\nresolution adopted by the 34 members of the\norganization as recommendations for crisis resolution.\nSince then, the head of State and the Government of\nHaiti have done everything possible to effectively\nimplement these recommendations.\nThe Haitian Government and the political\norganization Fanmi Lavalas, with a mediation role\nplayed the OAS general secretariat, have begun\nnegotiations with Democratic Convergence, a political\nopposition group, with a view to reaching an agreement\nin the framework of the commitments made in Costa\nRica.\nDuring those negotiations, various proposals have\nbeen put forward, particularly: the resignation of the\nseven senators concerned in the OAS report; the\nshortening by two years of the term of office of all\ndeputies; the shortening of the term of office of the\nsenators elected on 21 May 2000; the putting together\nof a future provisional electoral council; the holding in\nNovember 2002 of early elections for all of the\nmembers of parliament involved in the points that I\nhave just mentioned; and the holding of elections\nduring the first quarter of 2003 for the local offices\nwhose terms will expire in November 2003.\nPresident Aristide, the Government and the\nFanmi Lavalas party have demonstrated much\nflexibility in the framework of negotiations.\nUnfortunately, the Convergence remains intransigent\nand challenges the wording of the two last points, on\nthe holding of elections. The Convergence is frozen in\nits position, called \u201coption zero\u201d, which consists in\nsimply annulling the elections of 21 May 2000. Thus,\nthe impasse still exists; international assistance is still\nsuspended.\nMeanwhile, poverty rages in Haiti. The AIDS\npandemic, having claimed 260,000 victims, means a\nloss in terms of the life expectancy of our population,\nwhich had been painstakingly increased. Maternal and\ninfant mortality is clearly progressing. The figure of\n500 out of 100,000 dying in childbirth and the infant\nmortality rate, which has risen to 61 out of every 1,000\nbirths, remain very alarming. Given that children,\nwomen and men \u2014 an entire population \u2014 are dying\nfor lack of means, of financial resources, would it be an\nexaggeration to speak of another form of economic\nterrorism that none dare reveal?\nCan one justify the link between a contested\nmethod of tallying votes and the freeze on financing\ngiven to my country in the form of loans \u2014 loans on\nwhich we continue, despite everything, to pay\ninterest \u2014 especially since we know that the legislative\nand local elections of 21 May 2000 were held to fill\n7,500 vacant posts, that 29,000 candidates took part in\n4\n\nthese elections, and that voter participation of 60 per\ncent was the highest since 1990?\nThe Republic of Haiti remains confident of its\ndestiny. It appeals to the international community so\nthat its members will understand that the survival of\nthe people cannot be tied only to political manoeuvres.\nThe Haitian Government is committed to a process of\nstrengthening institutions and remains open to dialogue\nand all proposals that do not undermine the dignity of\nthe Haitian people. Against this background, we\nwelcome with satisfaction the letter of the Black\nCaucus of the United States Congress, of 9 November\n2001, addressed to the current President of the United\nStates, Mr. George W. Bush, which denounces the\ninflexible policies vis-\u00e0-vis Haiti that make economic\ncooperation dependent on unblocking the political\nprocess.\nThe Government is ready to do everything in its\npower to resolve the post-election crisis and put the\ncountry back on the path of development, but this\ncannot be done without the cooperation of the\ninternational community. To this end, it invites this\ncommunity to join it in its daily struggle for survival,\nreconciliation and peace.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\npresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly and wish him every success in this important\npost. At the same time, I take this opportunity to offer\nmy most sincere congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and the entire United Nations on\nthe occasion of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize award, and\nto express my gratitude for their determination to\ndefend the ideas of tolerance and mutual respect among\nnations.\nAllow me to extend my own and my country\u2019s\ndeepest sympathy to all those who lost loved ones in\nthe horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September. We are\ndeeply moved by the unspeakable tragedy and share the\ngrief of the American people and of all those affected.\nWe perceive the horrifying attack as an attack against\nthe entire civilized international community against the\nprinciples of freedom, democracy and peace, the\nprinciples upon which the Organization stands. In the\naftermath of the attacks of 11 September, the concepts\nof security, peace and solidarity are acquiring a new\nand distinct meaning. We recognize the growing\ninterdependency of individual actors on the\ninternational scene. The dangers of the new threats and\nrisks that confront our civilization come to the\nforefront. To conquer them we must not only move\nenergetically against the perpetrators, but also\nconcentrate on the causes that propel them.\nAt the same time, we are witnessing significant\nprogress leading to the creation of new relationships in\nthe international community. The fact that we were\nable to create such a wide anti-terrorist coalition so\nswiftly is very encouraging indeed. It is imperative to\nstrengthen that coalition and enable it not only to fight\neffectively against terrorism but also to contribute to\nsolving other pressing problems, especially those\nwhose solution will strengthen the struggle against\nterrorism by reducing tension and promoting justice\nand stability. The current, unusually wide, international\ncoalition against terrorism presents, I believe, a unique\nopportunity that we should seize. We should do our\nutmost to make it effective and operational. We should\ndo our utmost not to let it collapse for reasons that\nwould not stand up to the inevitable future scrutiny of\nour sons and daughters. We should do our utmost to\navoid the trap of allowing the struggle against\nterrorism, the struggle for peace, justice, stability and\ncoexistence, to be replaced by a clash of civilizations,\nby the very war that Osama bin Laden is calling for, by\na war against Islam. That would be a tragedy.\nThe international community has at its disposal\ngreat potential to address even the most complex\nproblems and crises. It must now reach an agreement\non how to approach them and on which tools it will\nemploy to address them. International organizations,\nand the United Nations specifically, play an\nirreplaceable role in this process.\nThe Czech Republic is determined to contribute\nto the search for effective ways to meet the most\npressing challenges of today and to support the\ninternational response to terrorism and the actions\nundertaken so far, especially if the military operation\ncontinues to be targeted as accurately as possible\nagainst military targets, in this, it is hoped, the final\nstage of the Taliban\u2019s defeat. We view these actions as\nlegitimate and in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter and United Nations Security Council resolution\n1368 (2001). Today more than ever we feel it our duty\nand obligation to preserve and cherish the uniqueness,\nas well as the open and universal character, of the\nUnited Nations and push more decisively for a\nstrengthening of the role we have entrusted to it.\nWhen we approach these most pressing\nchallenges we must be proactive. For its part, the\nCzech Republic is determined to carry its share. The\nCzech Republic has submitted its candidacy for the\npresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\n8\n\nAssembly of the United Nations. We hold this highly\ndemanding and prestigious position in great respect and\nare determined to actively participate in the realization\nof the demanding tasks ahead of us, in the most\nresponsible manner. We are prepared to be attentive to\nyour voices and concerns and to serve the entire\nmembership. We obviously wish to help with the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration,\nincluding the eradication of extreme poverty and the\nintegration of human rights into every aspect of our\nwork, as we were so eloquently reminded by Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan a few days ago. We need to inch\nforward the necessary reform of the United Nations\nsystem, strengthen the role of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, help to challenge the\nmarginalization of important continents such as Africa,\nLatin America and parts of Asia. We need also to help\nthe United Nations to play an effective role in the\nstruggle against international terrorism.\nIt is clear that accomplishing the objective of\nfinding and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the\nattacks on the United States is most urgent and topical.\nHowever, other phases can be embarked upon at the\nsame time. I agree with the President of Pakistan,\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, who said at this Assembly\nthat a three-pronged strategy is needed: first, to go after\nthe main culprits, the individual terrorists; secondly, to\nmove decisively against the terrorist organizations; and\nthirdly \u2014 what in my opinion is very important \u2014 to\naddress unresolved disputes, which proliferate\nthroughout the world and must be resolved in a helpful\nand just manner. As I listened carefully to speeches\ndelivered here over the last few days by many leading\npoliticians of the world, I was pleased to confirm my\nconviction that not only the Czech Republic or the\nEuropean Union, but also many other countries argue\nthat the fight against terrorism should combine the\nnecessary military operations with, above all, decisive\nattempts to eradicate the root causes of terrorism. It is\ntherefore necessary to pay far greater attention to\nconflicts that provide fertile soil for terrorism, because\nif conflicts remain unresolved for decades, they give\nrise to feelings of frustration, despair and\npowerlessness or, as the President of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran put it, to alienation, extremism and\nlawlessness. Political solutions of conflicts, many of\nwhich are essentially political conflicts, will reduce\ntensions, promote peace and fairness and, especially,\ntake the wind out of the sails of those who put forward\nthe absurd myth that terrorist actions can bring about\nanything other than loss of the lives of innocent people\nand the exacerbation of problems and conflicts.\nIn our fight against terrorism we need to look for\ncomprehensive solutions and to that end employ all\navailable tools to identify, isolate and destroy the\nterrorist networks and to combat terrorism as a whole.\nOur anti-terrorist striving must equally concentrate on\ncombating international organized crime, people\nsmuggling, and drug and arms trafficking. On the\nfinancial front it is necessary to cut terrorists off from\ntheir resources. A determined focus on preventing\nmoney-laundering is a crucial aspect of this effort.\nLong-term and extensive development assistance aimed\nat alleviating the most pressing problems of the\ndeveloping world should be an integral part of these\nefforts by the international community.\nThe Czech Republic sees the upholding of the\nunity and operational readiness of the international\ncoalition combating terrorism as the most imperative\ntask of the day. We, the international community,\nshould not lose this unique opportunity but should take\ndecisive action. The fight against terrorism is a long-\nterm mission and will have an impact on all aspects of\nour lives. At the national level, the Czech Republic is\npreparing a national plan for combating terrorism,\nwhich is inspired by the Action Plan of the European\nUnion.\nIn recent weeks the United Nations has shown its\nrenewed resolve to combat international terrorism. We\ncommend the Security Council for its swift action and\nwe support the adoption of Security Council\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) to combat\nthreats to international peace and security caused by\nterrorist acts. The Czech Republic is taking all\nnecessary steps towards the full implementation of the\nprovisions of resolution 1373 (2001), and fully\nsupports the actions of the relevant Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee.\nMy strong belief in the need for political and\ndiplomatic moves does not in any way suggest that one\nshould negotiate with the terrorists. Just the contrary.\nTerrorists have to be defeated and brought to justice.\nThere can be no negotiations with the terrorists. The\nevil of terrorism must be eradicated. The fight against\nterrorism has a higher priority than ever before, and\nnobody can stay neutral in this fight. The Czech\nRepublic is proud that it was able to offer both military\nand humanitarian help to the efforts led by the United\n9\n\nStates. The Czech Republic is proud that some of its\nhelp was accepted and thus that some of our best\nsoldiers can now actively contribute to these joint\nendeavours.\nAs I have said, conflicts can be a breeding ground\nfor terrorism. Terrorism fully exploits unresolved\nconflicts and profits from their expansion. Therefore\nour intensified fight against terrorism points\nunequivocally to the need for the international\ncommunity to pay far greater attention to conflict\nresolution in various regions. The United Nations must\ncontinue its major role in maintaining peace and\nsecurity throughout the world by applying an integrated\napproach of conflict prevention, peacekeeping\noperations and post-conflict reconstruction.\nRecognition of the roots of conflicts and\neducation towards tolerance must be incorporated into\nour preventive strategies. We fully support the\nimplementation of the comprehensive overhaul of the\npeacekeeping operations as proposed by the Brahimi\nreport (A/55/305) and other recent reports focusing on\nthis issue. The recent liberation of Mazar-e-Sharif in\nnorthern Afghanistan, and even the most recent fall of\nKabul, improve our possibilities of supplying the\nAfghan people with the humanitarian aid that they so\nbadly need. That must remain at the forefront of our\nendeavours. We should do our utmost to alleviate the\nsuffering of the innocent Afghan people. I believe there\nis an extremely important role for the United Nations\nto play in the consolidation of the post-Taliban Afghan\nState that is so desperately needed. We should fully\nsupport the current efforts of the United Nations, and\nespecially those of Ambassador Brahimi, to form as\nsoon as possible a stable, broad-based Government that\nwill reflect the ethnic diversity of the country. I agree\nwith Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that the one\ninstitution in the world that can deliver that better\nfuture is the United Nations.\nThe greatest tensions today undoubtedly prevail\nin the Middle East. It is regrettable that much of the\nprogress achieved in the past few years seems to have\nbeen squandered. But the uphill struggle that faces us\nthere is no reason for doing nothing and letting things\nget worse and would only mean that more people will\nsuffer and die. The Czech Republic is a traditional and\nactive supporter of the peace process in the Middle\nEast. We cannot reconcile ourselves with the current\nsetbacks. The political violence must be halted.\nDiplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing the parties\nback to the negotiating table must be fully supported.\nThe Czech Republic fully supports the right of the\nPalestinians to their own viable and independent State.\nNevertheless, its final shape should be the result of\nbilateral Palestinian-Israeli negotiations with the full\nbacking of the international community.\nThe international community has been\nencouraged by the change in political leadership in the\nBalkans, which offers a new opportunity to secure\ngenuine peace and economic reconstruction. The\nupcoming local parliamentary elections in Kosovo will\nbe an important moment in the stabilization process. I\nshould like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative in\nKosovo, Hans Haekkerup, for their work in the region.\nOur admiration also goes to the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the\nKosovo Force (KFOR).\nIn Africa, despite some progress, not only\npoverty and AIDS but also armed conflict remain\nmajor challenges to the United Nations and the entire\ninternational community. Although the destiny of the\ncontinent lies in the hands of the Africans, the\ninternational community should strengthen its efforts to\nassist Africa in its struggle to achieve durable peace\nand especially to acquire higher levels of development.\nThe struggle to reduce poverty has to stand at the\nforefront of our joint endeavours. Debt relief and\nmarket access are crucial elements of the economic\ndevelopment of developing countries. The United\nNations must continue with its activities to promote\nsustainable development and continue its programmes\naimed at providing basic health care and education,\nfighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and averting the\ndevastation of the environment. A gender perspective\nshould be included in all these efforts. The gap\nbetween the rich and poor countries continues to grow\nand is further exacerbated by the imbalance in the\ndistribution of globalization benefits. The digital divide\nis just an additional symptom of the growing disparity\nbetween the developed and developing countries. The\nUnited Nations, in cooperation with national\ngovernments, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), the private sector, the non-\ngovernmental sphere and civil society, must be\nprepared to address the challenges of globalization. In\nshort, we should respond to the globalization of capital\nby the globalization of solidarity and social justice.\n10\n\nWe need to create a functioning international\nlegal environment in order to prosecute crimes against\nhumanity. The Czech Republic fully supports the entry\ninto force of the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court, an institution that I believe will be a\ngreat asset for the maintenance of international law.\nThe protection of human rights will continue to shape\nthe fate of human society. Human rights are universal\nand indivisible, and it is in the interests of United\nNations Member States to support their Organization in\nits strenuous effort to secure the protection of human\nrights in today\u2019s globally interconnected world. We\nmust not remain indifferent to manifestations of\nracism, xenophobia, religious or political persecution,\ndiscrimination against minorities, violence against\nwomen or the violation of the rights of the child,\nregardless of where they take place. In this regard\nallow me to mention the World Conference in Durban,\nSouth Africa. However difficult the negotiations have\nshown themselves to be, they point to the fact that\nextreme intolerance and terrorism are closely\ninterlinked.\nThe implementation of United Nations reform is\nimperative in order to make the work of our\nOrganization more effective. As I said at the beginning\nof my statement, as a candidate for the presidency of\nthe fifty-seventh session of the United Nations General\nAssembly, I fully support the reaffirmation of the\ncentral role of the General Assembly, the revitalization\nof its work, and improvement of its procedural\nmethods. Equally, the reform of the Security Council,\nincluding its enlargement in the categories of both\npermanent and non-permanent members and limitation\nof the veto, would enhance the authority of that body.\nA re-evaluation of the application of the sanctions\nmechanism must also play an important part in the\nCouncil\u2019s work. The United Nations, more than any\nother international forum, is where people of all\ncultures and religions meet. We come here from\nvarious parts of our planet to solve the problems of\ntoday\u2019s world. Despite our different backgrounds we\ngather here to approach the problems that face us\nbound by the universal human values that unite us. The\nhighest of them all is the value of human life. We have\nbeen tragically reminded that we need to promote the\nculture of peace and to build an environment in which\nthe principles of these universally shared values will\ntake root. Now more than ever we must strive to\novercome our differences and be guided by our\ncommon interests. Let us unite our efforts and ensure\nthat our work during this session of the General\nAssembly contributes to a better, safer and more just\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n"

The ultimate success of our\ncampaign \u2014 this long and extremely complex\ncampaign \u2014 rests upon our collective ability to\ndemonstrate leadership, to harness political will and to\nsustain the commitment that we have made to each\nother and to our citizens: that we will not allow crimes\nso vile, so immense and so shattering to the world to be\nunanswered or ever to be repeated.\n32\n\nIn order to achieve these goals \u2014 and to merit the\ntrust and fulfil the expectations placed in the United\nNations and its constituent Member States \u2014 we\ncannot go on as before. There can be no more\n\u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. There is no more time, there is no\nmore patience and there are no more resources for\ndiplomatic gamesmanship and the stoking of dangerous\nself-interest. National Governments must take\nresponsibility and be held accountable for their actions\nand decisions \u2014 for fighting terrorism, for undertaking\npolitical and legal reforms, for resolving disputes and\nfor establishing the conditions in which democracy\nflourishes and development is sustained.\n(spoke in French)\nThe United Nations is now facing its greatest test\never since its creation. So far, the United Nations is\nperforming admirably. The unity of purpose and\neffective decision-making that allowed swift passage of\nthe landmark Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nand the rapid convening of a special debate on\nterrorism provide clear evidence of what we can\naccomplish together, and further underscore the\nreasons why this Organization and its esteemed\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, were deservedly\nrecognized with the Nobel Peace Prize this year.\n(spoke in English)\nWe cannot, however, afford to lose ourselves in\ncomplacency, self-congratulation or distraction. Our\nwork has only just begun.\nHorrific as the atrocities perpetrated on 11\nSeptember were, terrorism did not begin here.\nUnfortunately, too many of us in this Hall know this all\ntoo painfully. No, it did not begin here; but we as a\nglobal community have the responsibility, and now a\nrenewed opportunity, to ensure that we end it \u2014 here.\nThe United Nations has a unique and\nindispensable role to play. While the campaign against\nterrorism will be conducted through coalitions of\ndifferent State actors, alliances and organizations, this\nis where it must ultimately all come together in its\npolitical, diplomatic, legal, economic, humanitarian\nand security dimensions. We in Canada, as long-\nstanding proponents of multilateralism and the United\nNations system, have strongly welcomed the close\ncollaboration evident between the United States\nAdministration and the United Nations over these last\ntwo months.\nIn Canada, the campaign against terrorism,\nincluding the obligations we have undertaken here at\nthe United Nations, is our highest priority. Our country,\nwhich shares with the United States the longest\nunmilitarized border in the world and the closest, most\nextensive and most profitable bilateral relationship\nanywhere, has been deeply affected by this crisis.\nCanadians, like Americans and citizens of many other\nnations, are concerned about their security, but also\nabout what kind of a country and what kind of a world\nthey are to live in after 11 September. The interlinked\ngoals of protecting our citizens, providing assurance to\nour partners and allies and preserving the character of\nour free, democratic and diverse society have guided\nthe actions and decisions of Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien\nand the Canadian Government throughout this crisis.\nWe have committed 2000 armed forces personnel,\nships, aircraft and special forces to the international\nmilitary coalition against terrorism; and at home, we\nhave introduced a wide range of measures, legislation\nand new investments to bolster our security framework,\nincluding at the border and at our airports.\nCanada welcomes the reporting and monitoring\nfunctions provided for in Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001). We have already implemented many of its\nprovisions and are moving quickly on the rest. We are\nwell advanced in the preparation of our report and will\nprovide it to the Counter-Terrorism Committee well\nahead of the 90-day deadline. We urge other Member\nnations to demonstrate their continued resolve and\nsolidarity by doing likewise. Canada is prepared to\nsupport those States for which implementation poses a\ngreat challenge.\nAs we take steps in compliance with resolution\n1373 (2001), we are completing our ratification of the\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\nand the Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which will make Canada a full\nparty to all 12 existing United Nations counter-\nterrorism conventions. Negotiations are under way on\nthe thirteenth convention, the comprehensive\nconvention against international terrorism. That\nconvention will ensure that all terrorist acts are\ncondemned under international law. What is needed\nnow is the political will to complete the negotiations. If\nnot the General Assembly of the United Nations, then\nwho? And if not now, then when? The time will never\nbe more propitious, or the need greater.\n33\n\nOur international legal framework also requires a\nstrong arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament\nregime. Implementation of the Ottawa Convention\nbanning anti-personnel mines is proceeding apace. To\nkeep weapons of mass destruction from becoming\nemployed as the instruments of evil, we are also hard at\nwork to reinforce key instruments such as the Nuclear\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency safeguards, the Chemical Weapons\nConvention and the Biological Weapons Convention,\nall requiring strong multilateral action to ensure their\nfull implementation.\nI would also add that we are now very close to\nmaking the International Criminal Court a reality, with\nonly 17 more ratifications to go. The creation of the\nCourt will represent an extremely significant step in the\nongoing struggle to eliminate impunity for the worst\ncrimes known to humankind.\nThese are only the most immediate and most\nobvious steps to ensure our collective security, but our\nagenda must be far broader than this. Nothing has more\nviolently shaken our sense of security than have the\nevents of 11 September. But our conception of what\nconstitutes security and the nature of the threats that\nmay be posed to it was already undergoing dramatic\nevolution prior to the attacks.\nThe denial of human rights, the spread of\nHIV/AIDS, persistent mass poverty, unchecked\nenvironmental degradation and the blight of drugs and\ncrime all undermine stability, reduce human potential\nand obstruct social and economic progress. They are\nthreats to human security, as are discrimination and\nracism, which the Durban Conference was intended to\naddress. Unfortunately, it failed to achieve its potential\nand instead provided a forum for propagating long-\nstanding hatreds and biases, and the world is poorer for\nthat.\nThe resolution and prevention of conflict must\nalso remain at the highest order of United Nations\nbusiness, but leadership and commitment are required\nif we are to move from a culture of reaction to one of\nprevention, as proposed by the Secretary-General.\nJust a week ago, I ended a five-country visit to\nthe Middle East. I was reassured by the commitments\nof my hosts to the fight against terrorism. As have\nothers, I urged Israel and the Palestinians to put\nimmediately into place measures that will bring them\nback to the negotiating table. That is their only way\nforward. The essential truth is that there is no\nalternative to peaceful coexistence. That conflict\ncannot go on forever and leaders must act now to bring\nit to an end. The international community must also\nincrease its efforts to help bring about a just peace.\nFinally, there is little that is more debilitating to\nhumankind than the ravages of extreme poverty. This is\nmost notable in Africa, which will be a principal focus\nfor the G-8 in 2002, when Canada will assume the G-8\nchair. Speaking at this rostrum in 1963, Prime Minister\nLester B. Pearson, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, warned\nthe world of the dangers of a growing disparity in\neconomic and social development between nations. He\nurged that this \u201cmust be corrected before it creates an\nunbridgeable gulf between \u2018have\u2019 and \u2018have-not\u2019\nnations\u201d (A/PV.1208, para. 60). That was 38 years ago\nand the challenge remains more acute than ever.\nThe pledges of the Millennium Summit in\nSeptember 2000 must not be overshadowed by the\nurgency of the events that have taken place one year\nlater. Indeed, their fulfilment can and must form an\nintegral component of how we create a strong,\nequitable global environment that can be neither\nattacked nor exploited by terrorists.\nTerrorism does not speak to us; it does not speak\nfor anyone but criminals and murderers and it only\nserves to undermine the causes they purport to\nrepresent. It does not represent Islam; it does not\nreflect the will of the Afghan people.\n(spoke in French)\nThe fate of the Afghan people must remain\nsharply in our focus. That country has been so\nneglected, so abused and so driven into isolation by its\nself-appointed rulers that it could not even be ranked\non the most recent United Nations human development\nindex. The rights of its people \u2014 notably women and\ngirls \u2014 have been blatantly and repeatedly violated.\n(spoke in English)\nAn acute humanitarian crisis is building and we\nmust do more, working with United Nations agencies\nand other relief organizations, to ensure that\ncivilians \u2014 including refugees and internally displaced\npersons \u2014 are protected and have access to food and to\naid.\nFor this reason, Canada responded to the United\nNations humanitarian appeal, adding further resources\n34\n\nto the $160 million in aid that we had already provided\nover the last 10 years. We were also pleased at the\nprompt appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi \u2014 who has\nplayed such an integral role in the reform of United\nNations peacekeeping \u2014 as the Secretary-General\u2019s\nSpecial Representative for Afghanistan. Canada has\npledged to work with Ambassador Brahimi and other\ncoalition States to support the Afghan people in the\nsearch for a stable, fair and effective administration\nthat can begin the enormous task of leading\nAfghanistan forward to a more secure and hopeful\nfuture.\nThe opportunities for progress towards a more\nfree, prosperous and peaceful world have always been\nbefore us. In the haze of self-interest and competing\npriorities, sometimes our global community has not\nseen them so clearly. The enormous horror of 11\nSeptember has offered us that clarity, just as it has\nconcentrated minds and catalysed relationships. It has\ngiven us a renewed basis for cooperation between\nStates both in and outside the United Nations, driven\nnot only by the United States and its traditional allies,\nincluding Canada, but also through opportunities for\nleadership provided to Russia and China, to India and\nPakistan, to countries of the Middle East, North Africa,\nAsia and elsewhere in the resolution of this crisis.\nTerrorism globalizes us. It globalizes outrage and\ncondemnation, just as it does compassion and the cry\nfor justice. We must ensure that terrorism also\nglobalizes a sustained commitment to bringing about\nits end.\nTomorrow, 11 November, Canada and other\nUnited Nations Member nations will mark our annual\nRemembrance Day. On this day, we remember and\nhonour the men and women who have fought and\nsacrificed for our freedom. This week in New York, I\nhope that we will all take time to remember what it is\nthat we are together working \u2014 and, yes, fighting \u2014\nfor today: for freedom, for peace and for justice, and\nfor the dignity and realization of the potential of all\npeoples everywhere.\nAs we make our speeches, file our papers and\npress forward our resolutions in this great Hall, let us\nalso remember that the words \u201cUnited Nations\u201d \u2014\ncoined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942 \u2014\nnot only refer to an Organization or a name on a\nbuilding, but were first and foremost a declaration of\nsolidarity and of a common vision for a better world.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Similarly, we wish to convey our\nheartfelt sympathy and condolences to the other great\nnations that were directly affected by that tragic and\ninhuman act. They were not alone in their daily trials\nand tribulations; the Republic of the Marshall Islands\nwas with them. Furthermore, we extend our solidarity\nand condolences to the Government and people of the\nDominican Republic, who suffered losses in the recent\ncrash of American Airlines flight 587.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns\nall acts of terrorism. I am pleased to inform the\nAssembly of the ratification by the Government of the\nMarshall Islands of six conventions and treaties related\nto terrorism. They are the Convention on the Physical\nProtection of Nuclear Material, the Convention on the\nPrevention and Punishment of Crimes against\nInternationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic\nAgents, the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the Convention for\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the\nConvention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for\nthe Purpose of Detection, and the International\nConvention against the Taking of Hostages.\nThe marked worldwide increase in behaviours\nabhorrent to human dignity, freedom and basic rights of\ninnocent people encouraged the early ratification of the\nRome Statute by the Marshall Islands, which calls for\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes an\nearly establishment of the Court and the\nimplementation of its mandate.\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands remains\nfully committed to the principles enshrined in the\n31\n\nhuman rights bill. The Government is currently in the\nprocess of ratifying the following conventions: the\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Racial Discrimination; the United Nations\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and\nCultural Rights; and the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights. We are committed to accede\nto them in a timely manner.\nGiven the unique conditions under which we seek\nour livelihood, our Government has been readily\nsupportive of new scientific breakthroughs and\ninnovations for the betterment of the world. However,\nwe feel there are certain scientific initiatives that run\ncounter to human decency. In this regard, we fully\nassociate ourselves with the call by the Governments of\nGermany and of France for a universal convention\nbanning human cloning for reproductive purposes. We\nbelieve that such a scientific endeavour would directly\nviolate the Universal Declaration on the Human\nGenome and Human Rights, drawn up by the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization and endorsed by the General Assembly in\nresolution 53/152. Article 11 of that Declaration\nspecifies that\n\u201cPractices which are contrary to human dignity,\nsuch as reproductive cloning of human beings,\nshall not be permitted.\u201d\nAs in the past, the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands will continue to voice in the strongest terms\npossible and in the best form at its disposal, its\nconcerns and fears over issues relating to climate\nchange and rising sea levels. The Assembly is aware\nthat several Pacific island countries are represented in\nthis Organization. Like other small island countries, the\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands is plagued by a unique\nset of problems. Our coastal zones have become highly\nvulnerable to erosion, our groundwater systems are\naffected by high levels of saltwater intrusion, and\nincreasing salinity is having a direct impact on our\nsubsistence cropping. Such vulnerabilities, together\nwith prolonged drought, constitute a deadly peril for\nour health and survival.\nWe welcome the successful outcome of the sixth\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nwhich recently concluded in Marrakesh. The Kyoto\nProtocol is the best available solution to address our\nenvironmental concerns. We should be able to look\nback in the coming days and commend ourselves for\nthe mission that is to be accomplished. We owe it to\nour children and to our children\u2019s children.\nThe Millennium Declaration, adopted by heads of\nState or Government during the Millennium Assembly,\nshould serve as our guiding framework and road map\nfor achieving sustainable development, eradicating\npoverty, combating HIV/AIDS, preventing illegal\ntrafficking in small arms and safeguarding the\nenvironment.\nImmediately following the Millennium Assembly,\nPresident Kessai H. Note convened a broad-based\neconomic and social summit, the outcome of which\nwas the development of a national planning vision \u2014 a\nguiding framework for a long-term national\ndevelopment programme. I commend Member States\nfor their generous support and assistance for this\ninitiative.\nThe Government of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands is of the view that the United Nations must\nmove forward proactively in its reform process. We\ncommend the Secretary-General for his reform\nprogramme. However, much more needs to be done.\nWe encourage the Fifth Committee and United Nations\nfunds and programmes to support and cooperate in the\nreform process.\nThe Government of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands fully supports the expansion of the Security\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories, based on equity, to include developed and\ndeveloping countries so as to respond to the realities\nand challenges of our contemporary world. We note\nthat certain issues need to be agreed on. We should\nmove forward with broad-based agreement and revisit\nour differences.\nNow that this Organization has 189 Member\nStates, 14 of them being from the Pacific region, the\nreconfiguration of our electoral groupings should be an\nadditional matter to be placed on the table. It may be a\ncomplex issue, but through our collective efforts and\ninspiration, the goal can be achieved, and it should be\nconsidered without further delay.\nThe exclusion from this body and its related\nagencies of the Republic of China on Taiwan is a\nmajor, serious hindrance to the Government of the\n32\n\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in its pursuit of its\nfundamental rights to participate in international\ndialogue and regional organizations and activities. The\ntime has come once again to reconsider the exclusion\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan from this\nprestigious body. There is so much that the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan could do, in cooperation with the\nUnited Nations system, in the areas of sustainable\ndevelopment, technology, health, peace and prosperity.\nIn conclusion, the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands pledges its commitment to the principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nGod bless the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt\nthe outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo,\non behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, on his election\nto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession and to offer him our full support as he carries\nout his important task. I also take this opportunity to\nthank and congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, on the effective and decisive manner in which\nhe conducted the work of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-fifth session.\nI also pay tribute to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for all his efforts in serving the\nOrganization and the international community as a\nwhole and I congratulate him sincerely on his re-\nelection to his post and on receiving the Nobel Peace\nPrize for 2001.\nWe have all been struck and shaken by the\nheinous terrorist acts that took place on 11 September\nin the United States. They were an attack upon\nthousands of innocent lives and a clear violation of all\nthe religious, humanitarian and cultural values that we\nhold dear. Whatever our attitude towards and\nevaluation of those events may be, international\nrelations have taken a different turn and a fateful\noutlook since that day. Those events were epic in their\nresonance and the extent of their repercussions is not\nyet clear. One thing is clear, however: we will have to\nface new challenges and new constraints. Morocco\nreaffirms its full condemnation of these actions and\ncalls on all countries to mobilize their efforts to\neradicate terrorism at its very roots. Terrorism\nrepresents a threat not merely to international peace\nand security, but to the human race as a whole.\nWe believe that the United Nations is the most\nappropriate institution for investigating the deepest\ncauses of terrorism, not least because of the resolutions\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly\nestablishing a unified and comprehensive set of\nguidelines on this wide-ranging subject. That is why\nwe call on all competent bodies to do everything\npossible to fulfil their responsibilities for combating or\npreventing terrorism. Morocco is a multi-ethnic State\nfounded on tolerance, equality and respect for\ninternational law. It will contribute fully to the fight\nagainst the scourge of terrorism and its dangers.\nIt is absolutely clear that the question of the\nMiddle East is one of the most serious regional\nconflicts that the world has experienced in the past 50\nyears. Recently, we have seen a dangerous escalation in\nthe conflict that has taken hundreds of lives, including\nthose of many women and children, and undermined\nthe infrastructure and services of the occupied\nterritories of Palestine. Morocco has therefore\ncondemned the attacks and called for a lifting of the\nsiege of Palestinian towns and villages, where homes,\nschools and fields have been bulldozed. The forced\ncolonization of Palestinian areas occupied since 1967\nmust come to an end. We must break the vicious cycle\nof violence and reprisals, and return to the negotiating\ntable on the basis of the conclusions of the Mitchell\nreport and signed agreements between Israel and the\nPalestinians.\nMorocco feels that peace between the Arabs and\nIsraelis will have to entail an Israeli withdrawal from\nall the land occupied since 1967 in Palestine and the\nSyrian Golan Heights and that part of the territory of\nLebanon that remains under Israeli occupation. This\nmust take place on the basis of full compliance with\ninternational law, in particular Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\ndecisions of the Madrid Conference, which called for\nan exchange of land for peace. In this context, we\nheard with satisfaction the statement made by President\nBush concerning the establishment of a Palestinian\nState and the expression of the will of the United States\nAdministration to resume its active role in reviving the\npeace process in order to achieve a just, lasting,\n20\n\ncomprehensive and genuine peace for all the peoples\nand States of the region.\nMorocco takes this opportunity to reiterate its\nconcern over the suffering of the brotherly people of\nIraq and the deterioration of the humanitarian situation\nin that country. These are direct results of the economic\nsanctions that have been imposed on that nation for the\npast 10 years and more. Morocco hopes that the talks\nunder way between the United Nations and the\nGovernment of Iraq will help towards the lifting of the\nsanctions and put an end to the despair, pain and\nsuffering of the Iraqi people.\nMorocco welcomes all the efforts to be made by\nthe United Nations and the Iraqi Government in the\ndialogue, which will be held in confidence and\nfrankness, to find a just solution to the problem of\ndetainees and people missing since the Gulf War.\nMorocco supports both the independence and\nsovereignty of Kuwait and the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq itself.\nThe settlement of armed conflicts is also of\ncrucial importance to Africa, which, unfortunately, is\nstill being plagued by bloody but entirely contrived\nconfrontations. What is happening in Africa requires\nour Organization to adopt a new and pragmatic\napproach enabling us to maintain and strengthen peace\nin Africa on the basis of respect for ceasefires and the\nencouragement of dialogue between the parties, and\nconfidence-building. We need to provide for preventive\naction, as stated by the Secretary-General at the\nopening of this session of the General Assembly. We\nneed early warning mechanisms for areas of tension. If\nwe have such mechanisms, then we will be able to deal\nwith the deep causes of conflict, like injustice, poverty,\nepidemics and refugees.\nMorocco, which is eager to support peace and\nsecurity in Africa, welcomes all efforts undertaken in\nthis area by the United Nations and international and\nregional organizations. Morocco, as always, has\nresponded this year to the United Nations request for\ntroops from the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces to\nparticipate in the international peacekeeping operations\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is determined to\nexpedite the process of constructing the Arab Mahgreb\nUnion as a strong and balanced regional organization\nthat will lead to permanent stability in the region and\nstrengthen economic, social and cultural institutions. It\nwould also enter into fruitful partnership with other\nregional organizations, including the European Union.\nMorocco remains convinced that such a Union is\ninevitable and most useful.\nThe efforts to establish a Mahgreb organization,\nhowever, depend upon finding an enduring, just and\nfinal solution to the problem of the Sahara. The conflict\nthere is a stumbling block preventing the fulfilment of\nthe hopes of the peoples of the Mahgreb for good\nrelations, complementarity, stability, prosperity and\npeace. It is these hopes that have guided us since\nindependence, especially since the historic conference\nin Tangiers in 1958. Although some claim otherwise,\nthe settlement plan did not come to a halt because of\nthe huge number of challenges following the\nidentification process, but because of the huge\ndifficulties mentioned by the Secretary-General himself\nin his last three reports to the Security Council.\nFinally  and again contrary to the claims of\nsome  the Security Council, in resolution 1359\n(2001), requested the four parties concerned in the\nSahara conflict to begin negotiations on the basis of the\nframework agreement tabled by the Secretary-General\nin the Security Council and known as the Baker plan.\nIn fact, the initiative of the Secretary-General,\nenshrined in the draft framework agreement, is aimed\nat a negotiated settlement of the conflict. As the\nSecretary-General himself put it, this is a last chance to\nreach a speedy and final settlement in the Sahara\nconflict. Morocco accepted the draft framework\nagreement as a basis for negotiation, and is ready to\ncontinue cooperating with the Security Council, the\nSecretary-General and his personal representative,\nMr. James Baker, in order to achieve a just, peaceful\nand final settlement of the Sahara issue.\nIn keeping with international law and the Charter,\nMorocco invites all other parties to provide the same\npositive response to the appeal contained in Security\nCouncil resolution 1359 (2001) to start negotiations in\norder to achieve a political solution of this totally\ncontrived conflict.\nThe fact that Spain continues to occupy two\nMoroccan cities, Ceuta and Melilla, and the islands off\nthe coast of Morocco that are near them, is a pure\nanachronism and totally out of line with the values and\nprinciples upheld by the international community.\nMorocco, which would like to see a European-\nMediterranean community and dialogue between the\n21\n\ntwo shores of the Mediterranean, considers that a good\nrelationship based on cooperation and good\nneighbourliness with Spain is one of our basic strategic\ngoals. However, if we are to achieve that goal, Spain\nwill have to show an understanding of and good faith\ntowards Morocco's rightful claims on Ceuta and\nMelilla and the islands off the coast of Morocco, so\nthat Moroccan sovereignty over this territory can be\nexercised, with full guarantees for the economic, social\nand cultural rights of the Spanish residents of these two\ncities. There have been similar precedents, in places\nlike Hong Kong and Macao. Thus, we can refer to such\nprevious settlements that will be in the interests of both\nMorocco and Spain.\nChanges in the world economy make it essential\nfor Mediterranean countries to give their economic\nrelationships a strong impetus based on new concepts\nand approaches. That is why Morocco has tabled very\nambitious projects with some of the other countries in\nthe eastern and southern Mediterranean regions.\nThere is the initiative of His Majesty King\nMohammed VI, known as the Agadir declaration of\n8 May 2001, which provides for the enlargement of the\nfree-trade zone that now exists on the basis of\nagreements between Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and\nTunisia. The ideas for this free-trade area to be\nenlarged with the involvement of other Arab\nMediterranean States form a solid basis for the States\non the south and east coasts of the Mediterranean to\nintegrate in a framework of partnership and\ncooperation, as under the Barcelona Declaration,\ninvolving countries on the north shore of the\nMediterranean and the European Union in general.\nInternational peace and security do not depend\nonly on responses to political challenges. They also\ndepend on social and economic problems. We\nspecifically cite problems of the environment and lack\nof natural resources, where there are so many\nchallenges facing our planet, not least of which is\naccess to water and drinking water at a reasonable\nprice. My country had the honour of contributing to\nthis cause at the seventh Conference of the Parties to\nthe Climate Change Convention, which took place in\nMarrakech between 29 October and 9 November 2001.\nThis Conference resulted in positive steps on the way\ntowards an international conference on sustainable\ndevelopment to be held in Johannesburg next year.\nWith regard to the social issues that are of\nconcern to international organizations, the Kingdom of\nMorocco considers that the United Nations should\nincrease its efforts to benefit children, because they are\nthe future of the human race. The Kingdom of\nMorocco, upon the recommendation and leadership of\nits sovereign, His Majesty Mohammed VI and their\nRoyal Highnesses Prince Moulay Rachid and Princess\nLalla Meriem, has spared no effort at the regional and\ninternational levels to ensure the success of the Global\nMovement for Children. Morocco has in this regard\norganized three important conferences on children this\nyear aimed at mobilizing all possible resources \nregional, Arab and African  in order to make sure\nthat children enjoy their rights to health, education and\njustice. Based on such convictions, Morocco is\ndetermined to effectively contribute to the success of\nthe special session on children to be held next year.\nFor the second time in 10 years, our Organization\nhas received the Nobel Peace Prize, which is both an\nhonour and a burden. An honour for its success in\npreventing wars and in settling disputes peacefully; and\na burden because it leads to rethinking the role of the\nOrganization so it can become an effective tool in\nresponding to the new challenges and so it can fulfil its\ngoals of building a world in which peace and security\nprevail and in which all peoples of the world can\nharvest the fruits of technological and scientific\nadvances. Let us therefore rise to the level of such\nchallenges and engage in a true partnership and solid\nvisionary outlook so we can achieve these noble\nobjectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first condemn the monstrous attack on the\npeople and the Government of our host country. In\ncondemning it in the strongest possible terms, we\ndeclare ourselves in full solidarity with the people and\nthe Government of the United States, the families of\neach and every one of the victims, whatever his or her\nnationality, and the residents of this great city of New\nYork. We also associate ourselves unreservedly with\nthe resolutions adopted last month by the Assembly\nand the Security Council. We will carry on in our\ncommitment to the elimination of terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations.\nBefore taking up our Government programme and\nthe fulfilment of the Peace Agreements, and our\nposition on certain of the items on the agenda for this\nsession, I wish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. I have no doubt that your well-proven\ncapabilities and your recognized wisdom will enable\nyou to bring our deliberations to a fully successful\noutcome.\nI wish further to join the representatives who\nhave taken the floor before me in commending the\nSecretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan\nfor his wise leadership. We hail his well-deserved re-\nelection and rejoice at the recognition that both he and\nthe Organization have received, through the award of\nthe Nobel Peace Prize.\nI come, like many of those gathered here, from a\nsmall country that mirrors the grave problems facing\ntoday\u2019s world. Today we still do not enjoy the major\nbenefits of the great scientific and technological\nadvances, and we still suffer from great social\ninequalities. Ours is a small country that is doing its\nbest to attain peace and democracy \u2014 a country that\nbelieves in the rewards of economic freedom, but also\nin social justice. It is a country that has opened itself\nup to the world, although the world has perhaps not\nopened itself up reciprocally in the same way. It is a\ncountry that works and produces by making great\nefforts but that, in the present circumstances, is\nreceiving less and less for those efforts.\nIn this context, our contribution to world peace\nand democracy is diminished to the same extent that\ninequality, social injustice and poverty imperil our\npeace and our democracy.\n2\n\nToday the struggle against terrorism is the\nstruggle against inequality in international economic\nrelations; it is the struggle against ignorance, injustice,\ndiscrimination, intolerance, exclusion and poverty.\nThere will be no peace if we do not eradicate these\nscourges. A peace that goes hand in hand with\ninequality, poverty and injustice is a bad peace. And let\nus not forget that a bad peace is worse than war.\nWe are making strenuous efforts to advance in\nimplementing our own Peace Agreements, which\ncoincide with our Government programme. The time\nthat has elapsed since I addressed the Millennium\nSummit has witnessed intensive activities. I can point\nto significant progress, but I must also admit to some\nsetbacks, which are due primarily to an unfavourable\ninternational environment, which has affected the\neconomy in an extremely adverse way. I draw attention\nto this situation, because full compliance with the\ncommitments contained in the Peace Agreements\nwould be far easier in a context of economic growth\nthan in the framework of serious fiscal restrictions and\nincreasing demands on the Government.\nOn a different matter, I would like to comment\nbriefly on the United Nations presence in Guatemala. I\nwish to reiterate how much we appreciate the United\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala\n(MINUGUA). We trust that its mandate will be\nextended until the end of 2003 so that we can in a\nprogressive and orderly way transfer its functions both\nto national institutions and, wherever possible, to the\nUnited Nations programmes and agencies.\nAs far as our international relations are\nconcerned, I would like to mention the significant\nprogress made in the process of finding a peaceful\nresolution to the historical dispute between ourselves\nand Belize. In keeping with the principles of peaceful\nsettlement of disputes between States, we have\nconfirmed with deeds our commitment to dialogue as\nthe way of settling disputes. The commission of\nfacilitators appointed last year, within the framework\nof the regional organization to which both States\nbelong, the Organization of American States, will soon\nsubmit its report. Its fundamental aim is to work out\nand prepare courses of action to make progress in\nresolving the dispute.\nWe reiterate our firm support for Central\nAmerican integration and our commitment to the rest\nof Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Government\nhas supported major initiatives in the area of regional\nand subregional integration, and is working hard to\novercome problems left over from age-old border\ndisputes in Central America.\nAs to our position on other international conflicts,\nwe voice the hope that the differences or divisions that\npersist between fraternal peoples in the Middle East,\nAsia and Africa will yield to resolution peacefully\nthrough dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity to\nreiterate before this Assembly our concern over the\nsituation of the 23 million citizens of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, whose aspiration to be represented in\ninternational organizations has not yet been fully\nsatisfied. The Central American countries in general,\nand Guatemala in particular, believe they could indeed\nmake a positive contribution to peace and democracy in\nthe world.\nI would now like to comment briefly on our\nviews regarding the principal issues with which this\nAssembly will have to deal at the current session. First,\nI reiterate our full support for the United Nations as the\nsupreme expression of multilateralism. We are\nconvinced that the United Nations will have a crucial\nrole to play in the twenty-first century. It is our view\nthat the Millennium Declaration that our heads of State\nand Government issued a year ago offers the right\nagenda for our priorities and for the steps to be taken to\nattain the goals set.\nSecond, we agree that it is necessary to adapt the\nOrganization to the exigencies of globalization and to\nthis post-cold-war era. It is up to us, the Member\nGovernments, to further this process of adaptation in\nvarious areas, such as intergovernmental forums, the\nefficiency and efficacy of the Secretariat, the setting of\npriorities in shaping the programme of activities and\nthe financial strengthening of the Organization.\nThird, of the pending reforms, the one that has\nreceived the most attention is that concerning the\nSecurity Council. One cannot but be frustrated at the\nlimited progress made in this area at previous sessions\nof the General Assembly. Now more than ever before\nwe must redouble our efforts to endow that body with\ngreater efficacy, broader representativity and more\ntransparency in its working procedures. To achieve\nthese objectives, we advocate, inter alia, an increase in\nthe number of Council members, as well as a very\nsparse use of the veto power. We also believe that now\n3\n\nmore than ever before it is necessary that the Security\nCouncil\u2019s work be monitored by the General Assembly.\nFourth, deeply shocked by the events that\noccurred in this country on 11 September, we reiterate\nour full and complete opposition to terrorism, and we\nwill support any collective action by the international\ncommunity to combat this scourge. As a matter of fact,\nwe are already working to comply with the spirit and\nthe letter of the undertakings embodied in Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), within the parameters\nof a democratic society that aspires to guarantee the\nhuman rights of its members.\nFifth, we advocate the strengthening of the\nGeneral Assembly, and we congratulate the President\nof its fifty-fifth session on his initiative to revitalize its\nworking methods and procedures. We trust that this\naction will continue under the current presidency and\nthat it will extend to the wider task of reforming the\nAssembly, in pursuance of the aims of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nSixth, we are convinced of the need to strengthen\nour collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts,\nboth between States and at the national level. We\nbelieve that the report of the Panel on United Nations\nPeace Operations provides an adequate basis for\nachieving this purpose.\nSeventh, as regards general disarmament, we\ninsist on the need for progress towards the total\nelimination of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological\nweapons, the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons, and the use of anti-personnel mines and other\nexplosive devices. In this connection, we support all\nconcrete actions by the United Nations to accomplish\nthese aims, including those that look to the\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all\nregions of the world. As regards the control of illicit\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we are of the\nview that the results of the Conference held last July to\ndeal with this problem, while positive if allowance is\nmade for this being the first step taken at the global\nlevel to deal with the matter, are nevertheless\ninadequate.\nEighth, we offer our full support for and active\nparticipation in the principal meetings scheduled for\nthe years ahead, among which I wish to highlight the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, next\nMarch, as well as the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg.\nNinth, in a world characterized by ever greater\ninterdependence, multilateral diplomacy plays a crucial\nrole in the fight against environmental degradation.\nGuatemala, as a party to the main international treaties\nrelating to the environment, reiterates its commitment\nto the maintenance of ecological balance.\nFinally, we consider that the United Nations\nshould continue devoting itself to what we call the\ngreat unfinished business of the twentieth century \u2014\nnamely, the elimination of world poverty. Together\nwith the multilateral financial agencies, our\nOrganization should play a crucial role in ensuring that\nthe benefits of globalization are widely shared among\nall countries, not only among a few of them; this\nrequires action at the level of each country and at the\ninternational level.\nGiven the globalization process the world is\ngoing through, we must recognize, as stated by the\ngreat Mexican thinker Carlos Fuentes, that unregulated\nglobalization leads to more profound economic and\nsocial imbalance. We cannot turn economic policy into\na mere balancing of accounts in which human beings\nand populations are not taken into consideration. How\ncan we make demands on some countries when those\ndemands are not made of others in similar conditions?\nCivilization is being put to the test. The question\nis how to eliminate the universal threat posed by\nterrorism and at the same time maintain and renew the\nethical, political, legal and social bases for ensuring\ncoexistence in a globalized world. The only solution is\nto focus on fighting for more freedom, more\ndemocracy, more tolerance and more justice. In this\nrespect, I would like to share with the Assembly the\nwords of a distinguished Guatemalan poet, Otto Ren\u00e9\nCastillo:\n\u201cWe have suffered in so many places the blows of\nthe executioner and written his name so many\ntimes on so little skin, that we cannot die, for\nliberty has no death\u201d.\nMay God bless and protect us.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate\nHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo upon his election to\npreside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession, and to express my confidence that with his\nskilful guidance, his leadership and his outstanding\nexperience our deliberations will be crowned with\nsuccess. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to His\nExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent manner\nin which he conducted the affairs of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-fifth session. I wish him success\nin his future endeavours.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\nMozambique, I would like to extend our\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan on\nhis well-deserved election to the post of Secretary-\nGeneral for a second term, as well as on having won\nthe Nobel Peace Prize this year. We hail his re-election\nand the Noble Peace Prize awarded to him and to the\nUnited Nations as recognition of his and the\nOrganization\u2019s tireless efforts in the search for viable\nand lasting solutions to the problems facing humanity.\nAllow me to express our sympathy to the\nGovernment and the people of Algeria with regard to\nthe loss of life and property caused by the recent floods\nin that sisterly country. Mozambique, having been the\nvictim of terrible floods over two consecutive years,\nshares the sorrow of the Algerian people.\nWe also express our condolences to the\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\nAmerica and of the Dominican Republic on the tragedy\nwhich resulted from the plane crash last Monday here\nin New York.\nOn 11 September, we witnessed the most barbaric\nterrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. We\nare deeply shocked at the loss of thousands of innocent\nlives.\nWe wish to avail ourselves of this opportunity to\nreiterate once again the condolences of the Government\nand the people of the Republic of Mozambique to the\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\nAmerica on the tragic and unjustifiable deaths of their\ncitizens. We express our sympathy and solidarity with\nall of the victims and the families that have lost their\nloved ones.\n19\n\nWe reiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all\nits forms and manifestations, regardless of its origin or\nplace of occurrence, or of the race or religion of those\nwho perpetrate it. Terrorism represents a serious threat\nto international peace and security as well as to\nfriendly relations among peoples and nations\nworldwide.\nThe struggle against this scourge requires\nconcerted action by the whole international community,\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, for the\ntarget of this evil is not a single nation or people but\nhumankind as a whole.\nIt is therefore crucial that all United Nations\nMember States work together towards signing and\nratifying all of the conventions and protocols related to\nthe eradication of this enemy of humanity. These\nconventions represent the legal foundation upon which\nwe can build our collective action against international\nterrorism.\nThe work that is under way for the elaboration of\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\nconstitutes a further effort to reinforce the international\ncommunity\u2019s resolve to face the challenge of\neliminating the scourge of terrorism.\nMozambique came about as the result of the\nexercise by Mozambicans of their inalienable right to\nself-determination. Therefore, Mozambicans know well\nfrom their own experience what terrorism is all about.\nBut they are also aware of the distinction between\nterrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples for\ntheir freedom and independence.\nMozambique is ready to participate in a global\ndiscussion on this issue, as an important and useful\ninitiative to formulate a joint organized response to\ninternational terrorism, so that the targets of our\ncommon struggle against terrorism are clearly defined.\nConscious of the need for the effective\nimplementation of national measures to combat\nterrorism as a way to complement the international\nlegal regime, Mozambique has already initiated a\ncomprehensive review of international legal\ninstruments to combat and eliminate terrorism, with a\nview to ratifying and adhering to them.\nIn this context, Mozambique signed, on 11\nNovember, the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. However, it\nis clear to us that, for an effective implementation of\nthis and other legal instruments, Mozambique needs\nsupport from the international community to strengthen\nits institutions \u2014 namely the police, the judiciary, the\nfinancial system and the State prosecutor\u2019s office.\nLast year, our heads of State and Government met\nhere during the Millennium Summit to reaffirm their\nfaith in the United Nations and in its Charter as\nindispensable foundations for a just, peaceful and more\nprosperous world.\nThe leaders set specific targets to halve the\nproportion of people who live in extreme poverty, to\nprovide clean water and basic education for all, to\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and to achieve other\ndevelopment goals. They called for the strengthening\nof United Nations peace operations so that vulnerable\ncommunities can count on them in their hour of need.\nThey committed themselves to fighting injustice and\ninequality, terror and crime, and to meeting the special\nneeds of Africa. In order to achieve these lofty goals,\nall Member States should display political will and the\ndetermination to turn these commitments into concrete\nactions at the international, regional and national\nlevels.\nThe holding by the United Nations of the special\nsessions of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS and on\nHabitat, the Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nrepresent bold steps towards resolving the various\nproblems affecting humanity and constitute concrete\nsteps in the implementation of the provisions of the\nMillennium Declaration.\nMozambique is proud of having played an active\nrole in contributing to the promising outcome of the\nUnited Nations Conference on small arms and light\nweapons. We are confident that the commitments\nassumed at that Conference will contribute decisively\ntowards preventing, combating and eradicating the\nillicit trade in, and proliferation of, small arms and\nlight weapons.\nWe should continuously and critically assess the\nprogress made in each area of commitment, with a\nview to translating into reality the aspirations and\nneeds of our peoples. Each subsequent session of the\nGeneral Assembly should be used to assess the degree\nof progress made in the implementation of the declared\ncommitment towards specific targets. To this end, we\n20\n\nshould ensure that follow-up mechanisms are put in\nplace and effectively enhanced for the successful\nimplementation of the plans of action adopted.\nAs we take on the daunting task of pursuing the\ngoals of the Millennium Summit, we need to work\ntogether in a spirit of partnership and cooperation.\nToday we are living in a world in which a few\ncountries are reaping the benefits of globalization,\nwhile the majority, particularly in Africa, are\nincreasingly being marginalized by the global\neconomy. Consequently, these increasing inequalities\nand asymmetries aggravate poverty, fuel conflicts and\nthreaten international security, stability, democracy and\npeace.\nTo reverse this negative trend, we call upon all\ndeveloped countries to fulfil their commitment with\nregard to official development assistance, increase the\nlevels of foreign direct investment in poor countries,\nand to cancel the external debt of the heavily indebted\npoor countries.\nIt is disturbing to note that in Africa 340 million\npeople \u2014 half of the population of the continent \u2014\nlive on less than $1 per day. The mortality rate for\nchildren under five years of age is about 140 per 1,000,\nand life expectancy at birth is only 54 years. Only 58\nper cent of the population has access to safe water; the\nrate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 41 per cent; and\nthere are only 18 main telephone lines per 1,000 people\nin Africa, compared with 145 for the world as a whole\nand 567 for high-income economies.\nThis appalling situation requires a strong and\nclear commitment on the part of us all \u2014 Africans first\nand foremost \u2014 the international community and other\nrelevant stakeholders.\nThe establishment of the African Union during\nthe thirty-seventh Summit of Heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of the African Unity is\nrecognition that only by pooling our efforts can we find\neffective solutions to problems affecting the continent.\nThis effort deserves the support of the international\ncommunity, so that a solid union and strong integration\ncan become a reality in Africa.\nThe New Partnership for African Development is\nan initiative aimed at setting an agenda for the renewal\nof the continent, based on national and regional\npriorities and on development plans prepared through a\nparticipatory process. It foresees a new framework of\ninteraction with the rest of the world, including the\nindustrialized countries and multilateral organizations.\nThe encouragement given by the G-8 Summit and other\nmultilateral institutions in Genoa, Italy, last July is\nmuch appreciated.\nWe are also encouraged by the commitment\nassumed by ministers and heads of delegations at the\nhigh-level segment of the substantive session of the\nEconomic and Social Council held in Geneva last July,\nin welcoming the New Partnership for African\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and calling on the United\nNations system and the international community to\nsupport it. The invitation extended by the Council to\nthe Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to\nensure an effective and coordinated response of the\nUnited Nations system is a good course of action aimed\nat promoting sustainable development and active\nparticipation of Africa in the world economy. The\nAfrican leadership and ownership of the NEPAD must\nbe guaranteed during its implementation.\nConflicts are one of the main obstacles to\ndevelopment, particularly in Africa. In order to find\ndurable solutions to conflicts, we need to focus our\nactions on prevention measures and address the root\ncauses of conflict. In this regard, prevention should be\naimed at addressing, inter alia, poverty, governance,\nhuman rights abuses, hunger, endemic diseases and\nunderdevelopment. The success of this action requires\nnational ownership based on partnership between the\nGovernment and civil society.\nBeyond the preventive measures, we should also\nthink how we can effectively implement sound\nstrategies for conflict resolution and management. The\ncomprehensive review of the whole question of\npeacekeeping operations in all their aspects contained\nin the Brahimi report provides sound recommendations\nto improve the effectiveness of peacekeeping. It\nemphasizes the need for effective command and control\nstructures, enhanced levels of interoperability, as well\nas the importance of training troops to understand and\noperate with more robust rules of engagement. We\nbelieve that the recommendations contained in the\nreport will be effective if more resources are allocated\nto peacekeeping activities, particularly in Africa, and if\nthe response to actual conflicts are timely, so as to\navoid the application of double standards.\nInitiatives undertaken by regions and subregions\naimed at conflict prevention, management and\n21\n\nresolution should be supported and endowed with the\nresources they need to build their capacity to act\neffectively. The Organization of African Unity\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and\nResolution should be enhanced and consolidated to\nbetter give appropriate and timely responses to\nconflicts affecting Africa.\nThe international community should continue to\nassist Africa in searching for the peaceful resolution of\nconflicts, particularly in Sierra Leone and Somalia, as\nwell as in Western Sahara, when a United Nations plan\nhas been agreed to by all parties to the conflict.\nIt is worth noting that within the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) we are\nstrongly engaged in activities aimed at tackling\nconflicts affecting the region. As the current chair of\nthe SADC Organ for Politics, Defence and Security,\nMozambique, in close cooperation with the other\nmember States, will spare no efforts to promote peace\nand security, through conflict prevention and\nresolution.\nSADC will continue to work with the United\nNations and all cooperating partners to bring about\nlasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nAngola and in other conflicts on the continent. The\npartnership between SADC and the United Nations\nshould be continuously maintained and nurtured in the\nspirit of the Brahimi report.\nAs the chair of the Community of the Portuguese-\nSpeaking Countries, Mozambique is also engaged in\nthe current efforts to bring about lasting solutions to\nthe problems still affecting some of Community\u2019s\nmember States. The Community is happy to welcome\nEast Timor, which will proclaim its independence in\nMay 2002 as a result of our joint, concerted efforts\nwith the East Timorese people.\nWe are committed to the efforts made by SADC\nmembers to eradicate poverty, combat HIV/AIDS and\nbetter respond to challenges posed by globalization, as\na way to prevent conflicts. We are also supportive of\nthe Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan\nwithin SADC, which aims at boosting the region\u2019s\ndevelopment agenda for the coming decade.\nPolitical dialogue, consensus building,\npartnership and cooperation are a must and should be\npursued vigorously. We believe that the World Trade\nOrganization Ministerial Meeting in Doha, the\nforthcoming International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment provide unique opportunities to\ncollectively produce an integrated and effective\nmechanism for the eradication of poverty and the\noverall implementation of the development goals set\nout in the Millennium Declaration and in the plan of\naction for the Least Developed Countries.\nIt is our expectation that the Monterrey\nConference will be instrumental in reshaping the world\neconomic order, giving it more equity and fairness. To\nthat end, the Conference must resolutely address the\nsteady decline of official development assistance and\nforeign direct investment, untie development aid (as\nalready done by the United Kingdom, which we\nsalute), reform the international financial architecture\nand provide a sustainable solution to the debt crisis\nthrough broad, deep and faster debt relief mechanisms,\nincluding total debt cancellation for least developed\ncountries.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\nshould allow us to assess the implementation of\nAgenda 21, as well as devising appropriate strategies to\nfurther pursue this daunting challenge. In\nJohannesburg, we should strive to ensure the right\nbalance between environmental protection and socio-\neconomic development, while making poverty\neradication our highest priority and fully reinstating the\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.\nThis is perfectly consistent with the Rio spirit\nembodied in Agenda 21, a blueprint that should be\nabsolutely endorsed; we should avoid any renegotiation\nof Agenda 21.\nIn Mozambique the incidence of poverty reaches\nabout 70 per cent of the population. To address this\nnegative picture, the Government approved an action\nplan for the reduction of absolute poverty, commonly\nknown as PARPA, for the period 2001-2005. The\nstrategic vision of PARPA is founded on two\nimperatives: the need to maintain peace and stability\nand the need for rapid, sustained and broad-based\ngrowth, where private initiatives play an important\nrole. The programme has gained strong support from\nthe meeting of the Consultative Group that was held\nrecently in Maputo and a boost from Mozambican debt\nreduction, made within the framework of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.\nMozambique is greatly thankful to all its cooperating\npartners for the support pledged at the Consultative\n22\n\nGroup meeting and for the enhanced HIPC. We hope\nfor a quick implementation of the commitments made,\nso that our resolve to combat poverty can be a success.\nLooking at the longer term, the Government of\nMozambique launched a national initiative, Agenda\n2025, a strategy based on a constructive dialogue on\nthe future of Mozambique. The Agenda aims at\ncreating, through a participatory and inclusive process,\na national strategic vision for development, as well as\nstrengthening the Government\u2019s and civil society\u2019s\nability to define and implement national policies and\nprojects.\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS is another priority\nfor the Government of Mozambique, for which it has\nadopted a national strategic plan that focuses on\nprevention and reduction of the impact of the disease.\nThe plan places the human being at the centre of action\nand is directed at the vulnerable groups of the society,\nincluding women, orphaned children and youth,\nparticularly girls. In this endeavour, the Government\nhas adopted a multisector approach, with the active\ninvolvement of all stakeholders, including our civil\nsociety.\nBecause HIV/AIDS is a global problem,\ncombating it calls for a global solution, and we\ncommend the United Nations for having proposed the\ncreation of a Global AIDS and Health Fund to combat\nHIV/AIDS. The Fund will contribute positively to the\nprevention and combat of this epidemic, which gravely\naffects the region of sub-Saharan Africa.\nFloods affected Mozambique in the years 2000\nand 2001 consecutively, which resulted in loss of life\nand production and damage to infrastructure, including\nroads, schools, hospitals and houses, and forced people\nto flee from their lands and abandon their belongings.\nThese catastrophes posed a serious setback to the\ndevelopment of our country.\nWe are encouraged by the outcome of the Post-\nFlood Reconstruction Conference, held in Maputo in\nJuly 2001, at which the Government of Mozambique\npresented the reconstruction programme for the central\nregion of the country, following the devastation caused\nby the floods in the early part of 2001. At that\nConference, the Government also had the opportunity\nto report on progress made on the implementation of\nthe programme that had been presented at the\nInternational Reconstruction Conference on\nMozambique in Rome in May 2000. Once again, we\nwish to thank all those who extended assistance to our\ncountry. The Government of Mozambique also\nappreciates the contribution of the United Nations\nsystem and the international community at large in our\nefforts to consolidate peace, to strengthen democratic\ninstitutions and to promote development.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my\ncountry\u2019s faith in the United Nations and its Charter,\nfor they both remain indispensable foundations for a\njust, peaceful and more prosperous world.\n\n\n"

We are pleased to assure you of our\nconfidence in your ability to lead our work to success.\nWe would also like to express our gratitude to\nMr. Harri Holkeri for the able and efficient way in\nwhich he discharged the presidency during the last\nsession.\nI would also like to salute Mr. Kofi Annan,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and extend to\nhim our warm congratulations on his re-election to\nhead the Organization for a second term. I am pleased\nto congratulate him once again on winning the Nobel\n25\n\nPeace Prize. We are confident that he will continue in\nhis untiring efforts to lead the Organization towards its\nnoble objectives of achieving a better tomorrow for\nhumanity.\nThis session is being held at a time of extremely\ncomplex developments in the wake of the tragic\nterrorist acts that took place in New York and\nWashington, D.C. From this podium, I would like to\nreaffirm Sudan\u2019s condemnation and denunciation of\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We would\nlike to express once again our sincere condolences to\nthe Government of the United States and to the families\nof the victims.\nThe Sudan calls upon the Organization to rise to\nthe onerous challenges, heavy burdens and subsequent\nrepercussions of these events. This will require a\ncoordinated and collective international effort to\ncombat terrorism and uproot its causes and sources\nunder the authority of international legitimacy. In this\ncontext, we must differentiate between good and\nevil \u2014 we must avoid putting both in one basket. We\nshould not confuse the issues, because if we do, good\nmight be transformed into evil.\nI would like to take this opportunity to emphasize\nSudan\u2019s readiness to continue to participate in and\ncontribute to this effort. Sudan has ranked first among\nMember States that have ratified or acceded to\ninternational conventions on terrorism. At the regional\nlevel, Sudan was among the first countries to ratify the\nArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. It\nhas also ratified the Convention of the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference on Combating International\nTerrorism. We are in the process of ratifying the\nConvention of the Organization of African Unity on the\nPrevention and Combating of Terrorism. At the\nnational level, we have adopted a law to fight\nterrorism. Through these measures, my country is\nhelping to build a proper and sound foundation for\ncombating and uprooting international terrorism in\naccordance with international legitimacy.\nI would like to join those who preceded me by\nsaying that terrorism does not belong to a particular\nreligion, nationality, or ethnic group. It is an\ninternational phenomenon. Therefore, we must\ncoordinate our efforts internationally to uproot it. We\ndeplore efforts in some circles to link terrorism with\nIslam in cheap attempt to sow discord among the\nfollowers of divine religions and to portray the issue as\na clash between cultures and civilizations. Islam is a\nreligion of peace and tolerance, and as such is far from\nhaving any connection to terrorism.\nThe proceedings of this session could not have\ncome at a more opportune moment for us in the Sudan.\nWe reaped the benefit of our common efforts supported\nby our brothers and friends to lift the sanctions that\nhave been imposed on the Sudan by the Security\nCouncil since 1996. This will contribute to Sudan\u2019s\nfurther cooperation with the international community.\nIn this context, the Sudan calls upon the Security\nCouncil to pursue this objective policy and review the\nsanctions it has imposed on a number of countries,\nincluding Libya and Iraq.\nThe Sudan also calls upon the Security Council to\ndispatch a fact-finding mission in connection with the\nAlshifa pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, which\nwas destroyed by American missiles in August 1998.\nWe believe that the bombardment of this factory was a\nflagrant mistake committed by the former American\nadministration. It is a mistake that should be\nrecognized and corrected, which would allow Member\nStates and peoples of the world to regain confidence in\nthe Organization and help remove a source of\ngrievance and injustice. Thus the people of the world\ncould live together in a world of justice, equality,\nsecurity and peace.\nThe delegation of the Sudan believes that now is\nthe time to end the unilateral coercive economic\nmeasures imposed on certain countries, including the\nSudan, which have negative effects on many sectors of\nour population, particularly women and children.\nWe in the Sudan look forward to a new era in our\nrelations with the Organization following the lifting of\nthe sanctions imposed on our country. We are pleased\nto confirm that we will endeavour to make every\npossible moral and intellectual effort to support the\nactivities of the Organization that promote the well-\nbeing of humanity. We also anticipate that the\nOrganization will play an effective role and make a\nnew contribution towards assisting the Sudan in the\nimplementation of its national development\nprogrammes, including the eradication of poverty and\nthe rehabilitation of areas destroyed by war.\n26\n\nThe Sudan, as the current Chair of two African\nregional organizations, the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development and the Community of\nSahelo-Saharan States, would like once again to recall\nthe historic Declaration adopted by the Millennium\nSummit so as to confront the challenges faced at all\nlevels by the international community in the twenty-\nfirst century. The Sudan hopes this Declaration will be\ntranslated into real and tangible action aimed at\nachieving justice and equality and the full participation\nof all Member States in the creation of a better\ntomorrow where human beings will be liberated from\nfear, poverty and destitution.\nFor us to realize our aspirations, this session\nshould give special attention to reforming the\nOrganization\u2019s organs, since they are the mechanisms\nthrough which the international community coordinates\nplans to realize international peace and security,\ncomprehensive development and prosperity for all\nhumanity. The Security Council tops the list of these\norgans. Member States have been calling for an\nexpansion of its membership in the permanent and non-\npermanent categories, so that it will be more\nrepresentative of the current United Nations\nmembership. They have also called for improvement in\nits working methods and decision-making process,\nwhich should be more democratic and transparent.\nThe General Assembly should be enabled to carry\nout its role as enshrined in the United Nations Charter\nwith respect to maintaining international peace and\nsecurity, and should also exercise its duty to hold other\norgans of the Organization accountable.\nWe should like to emphasize the need to\nrevitalize the role of the Economic and Social Council,\nconsidering that it is the forum that sets out\ninternational development policies. Its resolutions\nshould be linked more to economic and social aspects\nthan to political ones. The Council should be guided by\nthe decisions adopted at the Vienna Conference, which\nconsidered the right to development an inalienable\nhuman right.\nAll countries that participated in the World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban,\nSouth Africa, unanimously confirmed their utmost\ndetermination to eradicate all forms of racism and\nxenophobia and to address their root causes in order to\nachieve justice and fairness for all peoples who have\nsuffered and continue to suffer from the scourge of\nthese heinous practices. The Sudan supported the\nimplementation of recommendations from the Durban\nConference, including those of the Group of eminent\npersons.\nWith regard to the deteriorating situation in the\nMiddle East, the Sudan expresses its deep concern at\nthe stalemate in the peace process and reaffirms the\nneed for total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied\nArab territories in accordance with United Nations\nresolutions. This will enable the Palestinian people to\nregain its sovereignty over its territories and establish\nits independent State with holy Jerusalem as its capital,\nand allow sisterly Syria and Lebanon to restore their\nsovereignty over all their occupied territories.\nThe Sudan also reiterates its deep concern for the\nnegative humanitarian impacts of the current military\noperations in Afghanistan on the civilian population.\nWe welcome and support the mission of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to bring\npeace and stability to Afghanistan.\nWith regard to Somalia, where the tragedies of\nthe long-standing war spread negative effects to the\nwhole region of the Horn of Africa, the Sudan\ndelegation calls upon all Somali parties to respond to\nthe voice of reason and complete national\nreconciliation in Somalia, allowing Somalia to fulfil its\nregional and international role.\nBy the decision adopted at the eighth\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nSummit in Khartoum last November, the Sudan was\nmandated, together with neighbouring countries, to\ncomplete the national reconciliation efforts in\ncoordination with Somalia\u2019s Transitional Government.\nIn conformity with this mandate to restore stability in\nSomalia, the President of the Republic of the Sudan,\nOmer Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, current Chairman of\nIGAD, has appointed a special envoy for peace in that\nsisterly country. The special envoy is engaged in\nintensive contacts with the countries of the subregion,\nthe Transitional Government in Somalia, the different\nSomali factions and the IGAD secretariat. From this\npodium, the delegation of the Sudan calls upon the\nUnited Nations and the international community to\nsupport the efforts to restore security, stability and\ninfrastructure in Somalia, so that the Government will\nbe able to fulfil its commitments and establish peace\nand stability in the country.\n27\n\nWe understand the concern of the international\ncommunity over the continuation of the war in the\nsouthern Sudan. I would like to bring to the\nAssembly\u2019s attention the position of the Government of\nthe Sudan with a view to ending the war and achieving\npeace through the following steps: an immediate,\nsupervised and total ceasefire; regular access to\nhumanitarian assistance for the population in need;\nnegotiations on a political solution to the problem; and\nthe reconstruction of the areas affected by the war.\nThe ninth IGAD Summit is to be held in\nKhartoum in January of next year. We hope that the\nquestions of the Sudan and Somalia will be given the\nimportance they deserve so that leaders will come away\nwith a clear vision of how to end the war and restore\npeace in this sensitive region of the world.\nIn this context, I would like to refer to the\nstatement of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of\nhuman rights in the Sudan before the Third Committee\nlast week. He stated that the war in the Sudan is not a\nreligious war, as is repeatedly alleged by some circles\nwishing to distort the truth.\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt and the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya for their joint initiative for peace and\nreconciliation in the Sudan. I would also like to pay\ntribute to IGAD member States for their initiative to\nstop the war in the Sudan and the genuine efforts to\nrestore peace in my country. The Government of the\nSudan will continue its commitment to cooperating\nwith the United Nations, donor countries and\nhumanitarian organizations in order to facilitate the\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of\nthe war.\nWith regard to economics, the Government has\nmaintained and enhanced reform and liberalization\nprogrammes and has introduced measures and\nincentives to promote local and foreign private\ninvestment. The Sudan has now succeeded in\nnormalizing its relations with regional and\ninternational financial institutions. A positive sign of\nthis is an increase in local investments and steady\nflows of foreign investment to the Sudan.\nWe are mindful of the accelerated pace of\nglobalization in the domain of international law,\nespecially in the field of criminal liability and bringing\nbefore international criminal authorities individuals\ncharged with committing heinous crimes prohibited by\ninternational law.\nIn this connection, we believe it is imperative that\nall States and individuals should stand as equals before\ninternational law. The avoidance of double standards is\na true safeguard against the distortion of international\njustice and ensures that it stays on the right path. We\nhave made considerable effort in the past few years, in\ncoordination with many countries of the world, to\nguarantee the faithful application of these standards\nand noble principles. To this end, the Sudan chose to\nfollow words with deeds by quickly signing the Rome\nStatute establishing the International Criminal Court.\nInternational cooperation on disarmament should\nbe based on commitment and adherence to\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, including the sovereign\nequality of States, territorial integrity, the peaceful\nsettlement of disputes, non-interference in the internal\naffairs of other States and the legitimate right of States\nto self-defence.\nIn conclusion, I would like to invite the Assembly\nto reaffirm the political will required to achieve\ninternational peace and security. I call upon all to adopt\nconcrete measures ensuring that globalization becomes\na positive engine of progress; that its advantages and\nbenefits are shared by humanity at large, not restricted\nto a minority; and that globalization does not lead to\ncultural and intellectual hegemony and is not used as a\nmeans of political and economic pressure. If that\nhappened, it would undoubtedly result in widening the\ndevelopment gap and the clash between the different\ncultures of the North and the South.\nLet us all join together in a new era of\ninternational relations based on the rejection of\nconflicts and confrontation, on mutual respect and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of others. To this\nend, I would like to reaffirm the Sudan\u2019s commitment\nand pledge to cooperate with the international\ncommunity to move forward in realizing the common\naspirations of all humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my pleasure to address the\nGeneral Assembly today in my capacity as the Emir of\nthe State of Qatar and as Chairman of the Ninth\nSummit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\nIt is our duty to make this important session of\nthe General Assembly a session for rebuilding\nconfidence and realizing the aspirations and\nexpectations of our peoples for a world where peace\nand prosperity prevail.\nI take this opportunity to extend to you, Sir, my\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\nthis session, and would like to extend my thanks to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. I must also\ncongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as\nUnited Nations Secretary-General and on receiving the\nNobel Peace Prize along with the United Nations.\nWe are all aware of the critical and extraordinary\ncircumstances in which this session is being held and\nof the political situation prevailing in the world in the\nwake of the events of 11 September. An analysis of\nthese terrible events, which we condemn, prompts us to\nsay that humanity has actually reached a tremendous\nturning point.\nPersonally, I believe that the way to offer the\ngreatest peace and serenity to the souls of the victims\nof that criminal act, the sincerest consolation to their\nfamilies and the most effective support to the friendly\nUnited States of America, where these events took\nplace, is for the international community as a whole not\nonly to confront what happened but also to act\ndecisively to avoid the repetition of such acts.\nWhat happened in New York and Washington is\nunprecedented and almost beyond our imagination.\nThere may be some strategic planners who see the\nevents as confirming their predictions, but for the rest\nof us they would have seemed like fiction only a short\ntime ago. Sadly, the events were all too real, and we\nwatched with amazement, horror and sympathy as we\nrealized their full import for the future of humanity.\nDealing with the repercussions of these events\nshould not be a matter of merely punishing those\nwhose guilt in masterminding and carrying out these\ncriminal acts is proved. Inflicting punishment, though\nimperative, will not, in my opinion, prevent the\n14\n\nrepetition of similar or even more terrible acts in the\nfuture.\nWe face an extremely serious situation. We are\nseeing what could be described as a globalization of\nterrorism through the evil utilization of the revolution\nof technology and communications. Thus, we are all\ninvolved in an unconventional war for which we are\nnot yet prepared.\nAs we know, terrorism is neither a temporary\nphenomenon nor confined to a certain continent, creed,\nculture or race; it is everywhere, concealed like time\nbombs in our midst.\nWe should therefore ask ourselves, what have we\ndone as an international community about this\nsituation? Have we actually faced up to it? What have\nwe done to rebuild confidence among people? What\nhave we done to contain the fear that is demoralizing\nour citizens? What are we going to do now to stop the\neconomic recession and social anxiety that threaten us\nall? Furthermore, is this the world we promised at the\nMillennium Summit a year ago \u2014 a world that would\nbe ruled by amity, peace and cooperation?\nIf anything, we have moved away from these\nideals. We now live in a world where liberties are\nincreasingly restricted, where democracy is in retreat\nand where caution and isolation are replacing freedom\nand openness.\nThe State of Qatar, along with all other Islamic\ncountries, has condemned the terrorist acts that took\nplace on 11 September. This stand was explicitly\nexpressed at the emergency meeting of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference Ministers for\nForeign Affairs held in Doha last month. Our\nunanimous agreement condemning what happened\nemanated from the values of our true Islamic religion\nand its sublime sharia, which is based on tolerance,\njustice, equality and cooperation among people and\nforbids the unjust taking of human life. It urges us to\nrebuild and to propagate peace and tranquillity.\nIn this connection, I would like to stress that what\ndeepens our conviction and strengthens our stance\ntowards these eternal cultural values is our realization\nand understanding of the geopolitical importance of the\nMuslim nation, with its diverse peoples, which makes\nit a strategic partner in the process of building balanced\ninternational relations.\nIn fact, this is what makes Muslims deplore those\nwho deliberately and desperately try to link Islam with\nterrorism. Our peoples condemn and reject terrorism as\nwell as all attempts to distort the image of Islam, which\nis the last of divine faiths, and those who abuse and\nterrorize its adherents and jeopardize their lives,\ndignity and interests.\nTherefore, it is now necessary to stand resolutely\nagainst all forms of harassment against Arab and\nMuslim communities in any country that take place\nunder the pretext of combating terrorism and the\npursuit of terrorists.\nWe need to have a clear definition of terrorism\nand distinguish between this phenomenon, which is\nbased on criminal practices and attacks against\ninnocent civilians, and legitimate struggles to throw off\nthe yoke of colonialism and subjugation.\nTerrorism has taken root not only because of our\ninability to tackle the sources of tension in the world\u2019s\nhot spots, but also because we have tolerated for too\nlong those who pursue policies of repression and deny\ntheir citizens fundamental liberties and basic human\nrights. The seeds of terrorism lie in places where\npluralism is rejected, corruption is allowed to spread,\nauthority is exploited and political opponents are\nhounded in the guise of protecting the security of\nhomelands and people. It is neither just nor logical for\nanyone to claim to improve internal conditions by\nresorting to oppressive practices or to suspending\ndemocracy.\nIn this context, we feel it is high time to put an\nurgent end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people at\nthe hands of the Israeli occupation forces. We call on\nthe international community to shoulder its\nresponsibilities in providing the necessary international\nprotection for these people against the unjustified and\nunacceptable daily aggression to which they are\nexposed.\nThat is indispensable if we want to avert an\nimminent human catastrophe, which would lead only to\na further cycle of violence, terrorism and destruction in\nour region. We urge everyone to support their political\nleaders when they call for restraint so as to avoid the\nloss of innocent civilian life and so that the right\nclimate can be created for a just peace to prevail in that\ntroubled region.\n15\n\nIn this context, we should like to put on record\nour support for the positive stance of the President of\nthe United States, George W. Bush, and his\nAdministration, with regard to the establishment of a\nPalestinian State. We would also like to pay tribute in\nthis respect to friendly European countries and other\ninternational bodies concerned with the settlement of\nthe crisis. The ultimate test will be whether they\nimplement measures reflecting the positions that they\nhave taken and move from making statements to taking\naction.\nWe must emphasize the need to address the\nhuman tragedy of the people of Afghanistan. We\nbelieve that it is our duty to provide all possible\nassistance to those people, most of whom are living\nunder extremely difficult conditions \u2014 conditions that\nfurther exacerbate their suffering, which was already\nacute years before the crisis brought about by the\nevents of 11 September.\nWe therefore appeal to the international\ncommunity to provide assistance and aid to save the\nlives of millions of Afghans who are facing a bleak\nfuture. There is an urgent and immediate need for relief\nas the Afghan winter approaches. We urge the Taliban\nauthorities to cooperate fully with relief organizations\nto ensure that essential food and medicines can reach\nall of their people. We urge the international\ncommunity to designate a safe corridor for such\nsupplies before winter sets in.\nIn addressing these urgent humanitarian concerns,\nwe believe that it is essential to seek a long-term\nsolution of the Afghan problem, as proposed by the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Such a\nsolution would be based simply on maintaining the\nterritorial integrity and Islamic identity of Afghanistan,\nand forming a government representing all factions of\nAfghan society, excluding none.\nIt is the responsibility of the international\ncommunity to elaborate comprehensive programmes\nand plans to confront all forms of global challenges. In\nthis respect, we are convinced of the necessity of\nreforming the United Nations so as to step up the\neffectiveness of its organs and agencies and to promote\nits efficiency. Equally, as States Members of the\nOrganization, we are required to shoulder our political\nresponsibilities and honour our financial and moral\nobligations towards the Organization. In this context,\nwe support the idea of expanding the membership of\nthe Security Council to make it more democratic and\nmore representative of the international community in\nour contemporary world. We also support the idea of\nexpanding the permanent membership of the Council in\norder to secure wider international representation. We\nalso support restrictions on the use of the veto on the\npart of permanent members, regulating the ability to\nexercise that right within limits established by specific\nconditions and provisions to be agreed upon by the\ninternational Organization.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to say that the\ntime has come for us to take steps immediately to\nactivate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In\nimplementing it, international organizations should not\nconfine their role to merely recording the violations of\nits principles. They should move towards a\ncomprehensive, democratic dialogue that consolidates\nits provisions guaranteeing people\u2019s right to participate\nin governance, expands its scope and makes it more\nresponsive, not just for today\u2019s requirements, but also\nfor those of the future.\nThe State of Qatar is convinced of the importance\nof \u2014 indeed, the necessity for \u2014 such a dialogue. As\nwe would be one of those to benefit from the outcome\nof such a dialogue, we are willing to contribute in\nmany different ways in order to make this a year for\ndemocratic dialogue that would truly reflect the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter at the\nbeginning of this millennium.\nIf approached with conviction and resolve, this\nendeavour will lead to the interaction of different\nviews, and could help to unify our efforts against\ncurrent threats and future challenges and dangers. In\nthis way, our cultural distinctions could be turned into\na source of strength and wealth, our social disparities\ncould become an element of diversity and contribution,\nand our political and geographical borders could\nbecome points of cooperation, convergence and\ncommunication among our peoples and nations. That\nwould provide an opportunity for all of us to live in a\nworld whose inhabitants take pride in their humanity\nand look forward to a future of prosperity and well-\nbeing for their children and grandchildren without any\ndiscrimination or distinction.\nMay the peace and blessings of God be upon the\nAssembly.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease accept my\ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your assumption of\nthe stewardship of this important Assembly.\n11\n\nWe also wish to congratulate your predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the skilful manner in which he\nguided the work of the Millennium Assembly of the\nUnited Nations.\nAllow me also to salute the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on being elected to a second term and,\ntogether with the United Nations, being awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize for 2001. This is because of the\ntireless work of both the Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations to realize the ideal that we all cherish: a\nworld in which all people can live in peace, security,\nfreedom, equality and justice.\nAs has already been noted and as we all know,\nthis general debate has begun later than usual. The\nreason for this is that two months ago, the forces of\nterror struck at this city, New York \u2014 the Headquarters\nof this Organization \u2014 and Washington, D.C., the\ncapital city of the United States of America.\nIt is proper that we take advantage of this\noccasion once more to convey our condolences and\ndeepest sympathy to the people and the Government of\nthe United States for the immense loss of life and\nproperty imposed on them through a callous act of\nmurder. We extend the same sympathy to all other\npeoples who lost citizens as a result of the colossal\noutrage of 11 September. We speak here about the\nterrible tragedy of 11 September on behalf of our\nGovernment and the people of South Africa. We speak\nalso on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\nCommonwealth.\nThere can be no doubt but that the peoples of the\nworld have to unite in action to defeat terrorism. There\ncan be no hesitation among any of us in the resolve to\nwork together to ensure that those responsible for the\nheinous actions of September 11 are brought to justice.\nThis is so not only because many nations lost\ntheir citizens on that terrible day, important as that is. It\nis so, because terrorism has demonstrated that it has no\nrespect for borders. It has shown in a very graphic,\ntragic and painful manner, as it did also in Kenya and\nTanzania, that our very humanity renders all of us,\nwithout exception, potential targets of cold-blooded\nmurder.\nWhere we might have used the concept of a\nglobal village loosely in the past, on 11 September\nterrorism taught us the abiding lesson that we do\nindeed belong to a global village. None within this\nvillage will be safe unless all the villagers act together\nto secure and guarantee that safety. All must act to\npromote the safety and security of one and all, on the\nbasis of a shared responsibility born of a shared danger.\nAccordingly, we have no choice but to get\ntogether in the village square to agree on the threat that\nconfronts us. Together, in that village square, we have\nto determine what we do about this commonly defined\nthreat. This is the ineluctable conclusion we must draw\nfrom the terrorist attacks of 11 September.\nTo guarantee world peace and security in the light\nof the threat posed by terrorism requires that this\nOrganization, the United Nations, must discharge its\nresponsibility to unite the peoples of the world to adopt\nan international convention against terrorism.\nNecessarily, all of us must experience a shared\nsense of ownership of this convention, precisely\nbecause it would not be merely a statement of\nprinciples, but a set of injunctions and prescriptions\nthat will be binding on all of us as States. Thus should\neach one of us be ready to integrate our respective\nsovereignties within a global human sovereignty,\ndefined and governed by all of us, with none treated as\nsuperior or inferior.\nThe challenge to unite the peoples of the world to\nfight the common threat of terrorism brings to the fore\nthe need to speed up the transformation of the United\nNations so that it is able to respond to the global\nchallenges we face together, in an equitable manner.\nThis means that it needs to be efficient, effective and\nresponsive to the needs of humanity as a whole.\n11 September emphasized the point that, even as\nthe democratic system of government is being\nconsolidated throughout the world, even as we all work\nto sustain the possibility of a serious and meaningful\nglobal dialogue, there are some who are prepared to\nresort to force in pursuit of their goals. Clearly, there\nmust be a response. But what should that response be?\nImmediately, it is correct that we must achieve\nglobal security cooperation so that the perpetrators of\nthe 11 September acts of terrorism are apprehended and\npunished. Correctly, the Government of the United\nStates has emphasized that all action that is carried out\nmust be clearly targeted against the terrorists. It has\nstated that such actions, including military actions,\nshould not degenerate into collective punishment\nagainst any people on any grounds whatsoever,\n12\n\nincluding those of religion, race or ethnicity.\nAccordingly, it is indeed necessary that humanitarian\nassistance be extended to the people of Afghanistan.\nWe fully agree with that approach. The United States\nGovernment has also said that these actions should be\nof the shortest duration possible, consistent with the\nobjective that must be achieved. Again, we agree with\nthis without reservation.\nThe call has gone out that all Governments and\ncountries should contribute whatever they can to ensure\nthat the common efforts to find and punish the\nterrorists responsible for 11 September are met with\ntheir just results. We have responded positively to this\ncall because it is timely, correct and just.\nAll these are important elements of what has to\nbe done to respond to those who committed the mass\nmurders of 11 September. But they also indicate the\nway forward as we consider the rules that should guide\nus as we confront the threat of terrorism over the\nlonger term and beyond the critically important\noperations and activities focused on the events of 11\nSeptember. They put the matter firmly on our common\nagenda: We must also achieve global cooperation for\nthe speedy resolution of conflict situations everywhere\nin the world.\nIn this regard, it is clear that the situation in the\nMiddle East cries out for an urgent and lasting solution.\nIn this context, we might recall the words of the Irish\npoet, William Butler Yeats, when he said \u201ctoo long a\nsacrifice can make a stone of the heart\u201d. The sacrifice\nof the Palestinian people should not be allowed to drag\non any longer. Whatever these long-suffering people\nmight themselves think and feel, it is clear that there\nare some in the world who will justify their destructive\nrage by claiming to be front-line fighters for the\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\nBeyond this, we must act together to determine\nthe issues that drive people to resort to force and agree\non what we should do to eliminate those issues. At the\nsame time, we must make the point patently clear that\nsuch determination does not in any way constitute an\nattempt to justify terrorism. Together, we must take the\nfirm position that no circumstances whatsoever can\never justify resort to terrorism.\nThe need to realize together the goal of\ndetermining the matters that make for peace once again\nunderlines the need for properly representative\ninternational institutions to build the necessary global\nconsensus. It would seem obvious that the fundamental\nsource of conflict in the world today is the socio-\neconomic deprivation of billions of people across the\nglobe, coexisting side by side with islands of enormous\nwealth and prosperity within and among countries. This\nnecessarily breeds a deep sense of injustice, social\nalienation and despair and a willingness to sacrifice\ntheir lives among those who feel they have nothing to\nlose and everything to gain, regardless of the form of\naction to which they resort.\nAs the Durban World Conference concluded,\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\nintolerance remain a critical part of the practices that\nserve to alienate billions of people and contribute to\nmutual antagonisms among human beings. The\ninternational community should spare no effort to\nensure that this affront to human dignity is totally\neradicated.\nLast year, we convened in this very Hall in the\nhistoric Millennium Summit. Solemnly, and with\nserious intent, we adopted the Millennium Declaration.\nThe heavy and urgent obligation we now face is to\nimplement the programme of action spelt out in that\nDeclaration. This constitutes and must constitute the\ndecisive front of struggle against terrorism.\nAfrica, for its part, has developed a New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development, which is a\nproduct of the consciousness among the African people\nthat they themselves hold the key to the continent\u2019s\ndevelopment, security and stability. Africans across the\ncontinent have arrived at the correct determination that\nhuman rights, democracy, peace, stability and justice\nare the fundamental building blocks for a prosperous\ncontinent. Concomitantly, African countries are taking\nmeasures, jointly and severally, to improve the\nconditions for much-needed investment, economic\nrenewal and development. Naturally, the United\nNations has a pivotal role to play in this regard.\nAs we meet here, members of the World Trade\nOrganization are engaged in critical negotiations in\nDoha, Qatar, hopefully to agree to a new equitable\ntrading relationship that is fair and just. It is imperative\nthat there be a non-discriminatory and equitable trading\nsystem that promotes sustainable development.\nSoon, ministers of health, the World Health\nOrganization and others concerned will be finalizing\nthe details relating to the global health fund to deal\n13\n\nwith the major communicable diseases, including\nmalaria, tuberculosis and AIDS.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held next March in Mexico, will\ncover a range of pertinent issues, such as debt relief,\nofficial development assistance and foreign direct\ninvestment. As we all know, substantial capital flows\ninto the developing countries are critical in the struggle\nto defeat poverty and underdevelopment.\nAll these constitute vital component parts of what\nmust inform the outcome of the Johannesburg World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in September\nnext year. We are confident that the Summit will reach\npositive conclusions that will include firm global,\nregional and national commitments to the elaboration,\nintegration and implementation of economically\nefficient, socially responsible and environmentally\nsound development policies.\nThere is no doubt that our global village has the\nresources and capacity to meet the needs of all its\ncitizens. What is needed is the collective will of the\ninternational community to act decisively to meet this\nchallenge, inspired by a sense of human solidarity.\nPeace and security for all, freedom and democracy for\nall, prosperity for all and genuine equality in conditions\nof diversity must surely be the outcomes towards which\nthe United Nations and all of us must strive. Our\nactions must affirm the seriousness of our intent.\n\n\n\n\n"

Every civilized nation here today is resolved\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\nlawless violence.\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\nthey threaten us all.\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\nmore than three hours.\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\nsave others.\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\nleaders.\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world\u2019s oldest\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\nforbids both. They dare to ask God\u2019s blessing as they\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\n8\n\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\nmurderer.\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\nfunerals of the children.\nAnd the people of my country will remember\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\njustice will come.\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder \u2014\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\npotential target.\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself \u2014 the\ncivilization we share \u2014 is threatened. History will\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\nnation in this Hall.\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\nThose commitments \u2014 hope and order, law and life \u2014\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\nThe United Nations has risen to this\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\nfor that strong and principled stand.\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\nand to protect against threats.\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\nplan and hide.\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\nhelp.\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\nmistaken.\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\neventually consume them. For every regime that\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\nand equally accountable to justice.\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\n9\n\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul\u2019s soccer\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\nmaking progress against military targets \u2014 and that is\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\nburden of war.\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\nregime: the Taliban\u2019s days of harbouring terrorists, and\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\nriddance.\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\ntheir country.\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\nUnited States will work closely with the United\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\npeople.\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\nfinancial institution in every nation.\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\ntogether to bring them to justice.\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\nthe United Nations.\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\nterrorists \u2014 and to actively prevent private citizens\nfrom providing them.\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required \u2014 and more\nis expected \u2014 of our coalition against terror. We are\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\nGovernment that rejects this principle \u2014 trying to pick\nand choose its terrorist friends \u2014 will know the\nconsequences.\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\nattacks of 11 September \u2014 malicious lies that attempt\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\nadvance the cause of terror.\n10\n\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\nviolence grows.\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\nThe American Government also stands by its\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\nworking towards a day when two States \u2014 Israel and\nPalestine \u2014 live peacefully together, within secure and\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\nwill come only when all have sworn off \u2014 forever \u2014\nincitement, violence and terror.\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\nUnited Nations itself \u2014 and the world needs its\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\nthis great institution, for example, when the\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\nthe world\u2019s most persistent violators of human rights.\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\nauthority \u2014 and that authority must be preserved.\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\nfield.\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\nbut our existence \u2014 the tolerance of openness and the\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\nconflict is certain.\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty \u2014 the natural\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\ndignity. When men and women are released from\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\ngain strength for a long journey.\nIt is our task \u2014 the task of this generation \u2014 to\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\nhistory\u2019s call. We have a chance to write the story of\nour times \u2014 a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\nany life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go\nforward \u2014 confident, determined and unafraid.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTrinidad and\nTobago would like to congratulate the President on his\nelection to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. His unanimous endorsement by\nboth his regional group and all Member States is\ntestimony of the high esteem in which he and his\ncountry are held by the Organization. He may rest\nassured of the full cooperation of my delegation as he\nengages in the task of presiding over the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago takes\nthis opportunity to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri, President\nof the Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, for the skilful\nmanner in which he guided the Organization during his\ntenure.\nMy delegation also congratulates the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to serve this\nbody for a second term. Mr. Annan has brought a\nunique vision and a sense of purpose to the United\nNations, engendering in the Organization a renewed\nspirit to address the issues confronting the international\ncommunity at the dawn of this century. In so doing he\nhas sought to put the basic rights and collective\naspirations of human beings at the centre of the work\nof the United Nations. It is not surprising therefore that\nboth Mr. Annan and the Organization that he so\neffectively heads should this year be recipients of one\n25\n\nof the world\u2019s most coveted and prestigious awards, the\nNobel Prize for Peace. Trinidad and Tobago extends to\nthem its most sincere congratulations.\nIt is with an equal sense of pride that I also feel\ncompelled to mention that the twin island State of\nTrinidad and Tobago is the birthplace of another of this\nyear\u2019s Nobel laureates, Sir Vidiadhar Naipaul, recipient\nof the Prize for Literature.\nIt is propitious that 2001 was proclaimed the Year\nof Dialogue among Civilizations by the General\nAssembly. It is a clear acknowledgement by the\ninternational community that it is only through\ndialogue that the voices of diverse peoples, and their\napproaches to the many challenges that face them, find\nexpression. Indeed, tolerance and respect for diversity\nremain key components of the strategies that must be\ndeveloped to address these concerns. Dialogue that is\nfair and free of fear speaks not merely of a civilized\nsociety but of a society that will endure. History will\njudge us, not by our so-called progress, but by what we\nas people, as nation States and as a world community\nallow to endure.\nIn this regard, the fundamental values enshrined\nin the Millennium Declaration are so integral to this\nprocess that they can never be overemphasized. They\nprovide the much needed guidance required in\nmaintaining focus and commitment as we strive to\naddress these global challenges. Indeed, in the context\nof unfolding world events, there appears to be a greater\nand more urgent need to recommit ourselves to the\nvalues inherent in dialogue among nations.\nTwo months ago, in our host city of New York, in\nWashington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania, the world\nwitnessed the most heinous terrorist assault. Many\nMember States, including my own, count their citizens\namong the victims. We have all been affected by the\ndiverse and widening repercussions of that assault. It\nwas a harsh and tragic reminder that we live in a global\nenvironment and that events in one country can have an\nimpact on each and every one of us.\nWe must recognize those vicious acts for what\nthey are. No country is immune from terrorism. We\nhave a collective responsibility to send a strong and\nclear message that such acts will not go unpunished.\nAction has been initiated to counter them. Member\nStates must therefore pursue with renewed vigour, at\nthe national and international levels, all appropriate\nmeasures designed to combat this scourge against\nmankind. In keeping with this stance, Trinidad and\nTobago has already acceded to 11 of the international\nconventions against terrorism. Trinidad and Tobago\nvehemently condemns terrorism in all its\nmanifestations, wherever it occurs.\nActs of terrorism have their origin in the hearts\nand minds of the misguided. There are now looming\nthreats of recourse to bioterrorism, chemical warfare\nand even nuclear weapons. The international\ncommunity should not delude itself that conventional\ntactics will return that sense of security that many parts\nof the world enjoyed prior to 11 September. A world\nforum like the United Nations must address the\nfundamental underlying causes \u2014 the social,\neconomic, political and psychological conditions that\nprovide a fertile breeding ground for terrorism. We\nhave a moral responsibility to our citizens, to our\nchildren and to coming generations, to make the world\na better place for them by denying the terrorist his use\nof fear and intimidation.\nLet me extend, on behalf of the Government and\nthe people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, our\ncondolences to those who lost their lives in the recent\ntragic aeroplane crash.\nDespite the gravity and topical nature of the\nphenomenon of terrorism, we cannot allow the spectre\nof terrorism to deter us in our sense of purpose as we\npursue developmental objectives aimed at the\nbetterment of our peoples. Neither should we allow it\nto deflect attention from other activities which impact\njust as negatively on our societies, such as the illicit\ndrug trade and the illegal trade in small arms. For its\npart, my Government has enacted legislation\nauthorizing the confiscation of the assets resulting from\ndrug trafficking. In like manner, existing legislation\nwill be strengthened and relevant measures put in place\nas part of my country\u2019s contribution to the international\neffort in the fight against terrorism.\nIt is this very need to preserve democracy, the\nrule of law and respect for human rights, that spurred\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago to propose, in\n1989, a renewed focus on the establishment of a\npermanent International Criminal Court. We will\ncontinue our efforts to have the crimes of illegal drug\ntrafficking and terrorism included within the\njurisdiction of the Court.\nAt the national level, the Government of Trinidad\nand Tobago recognizes the need also to maintain a\n26\n\nfocus on promoting economic growth and creating a\nbetter quality of life for all its citizens as key elements\nin preserving democracy. In this context, the\nGovernment has identified nine key objectives aimed at\ncreating a healthier, better educated and highly skilled\nnation, capable of fully participating in the life of the\nnational community and the wider global society. But\neven as we pursue these objectives, we know that, as a\nsmall island developing State, we have special needs\nand vulnerabilities. Therefore what is required is a\nsupportive, regional and global environment. That is\nwhy we accord special significance to the\nachievements of the various development targets set\nout at last year\u2019s Millennium Summit. As a small\nisland developing State, we would like to remind this\nAssembly of the Summit\u2019s resolve to implement,\nrapidly and in full, the 1994 Barbados Programme of\nAction and the 1999 outcome of the twenty-second\nspecial session of the General Assembly pertaining to\nthe needs of small island developing States.\nTrinidad and Tobago is also of the view that trade\nremains one of the essential elements for our economic\ngrowth. While safety and security concerns have\nbecome a priority, the onus is still on the international\ncommunity to guarantee the strength and stability of\ncommodity prices, on which the majority of developing\ncountries depend to finance their growth and\ndevelopment.\nConsideration must also be given to extending\ndebt relief to middle-income countries, as this will free\nresources otherwise allocated to debt servicing to assist\nin the financing of critical sectors, such as health and\neducation. Trinidad and Tobago, for example, currently\nutilizes a significant portion of its gross domestic\nproduct to meet debt servicing requirements \u2014\nresources which would be better utilized in our fight\nagainst the AIDS pandemic, which is fast emerging as\na major development challenge, not only for Trinidad\nand Tobago, but for many of our sister islands in the\nCaribbean and elsewhere in the world.\nResource mobilization at the national, regional\nand international levels is central to the development of\nsmall island States. Trinidad and Tobago has\nconsequently given priority to the mobilization of\ndomestic resources within an overall macroeconomic\npolicy which encourages the creation of a competitive\nbusiness environment.\nSuccess in domestic resource mobilization is,\nhowever, heavily dependent on the external\nenvironment and linked to success in accessing the\nmarkets of developed countries. Many of the factors\nwhich impinge on the process of attracting foreign\ncapital lie outside the control of developing countries.\nTrinidad and Tobago faces the particular problem of\nattracting foreign investment in the non-oil sector,\nwhich affects the overall development of the social\ninfrastructure. Foreign direct investment also tends to\nflow where profits are highest, not necessarily where a\nsound policy for the creation of a hospitable local\nenvironment has been instituted.\nOf equal significance for developing States is\nnext year\u2019s International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, at which the central issue of reforming\nthe decision-making system will be under review.\nInternational financial institutions, for their own part,\nmust therefore work to ensure that developing\ncountries are allowed to participate more fully in all\npolicy decisions which directly affect them.\nSimilarly, the special and differential treatment\nprovisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nagreements must be implemented if developing\ncountries are to maximize their potential gains of trade.\nTrinidad and Tobago is convinced of the need for the\nWTO to recognize the differences in the levels of\ndevelopment capacity which exist among its members,\nincluding developing States. Our position on this issue\nwas clearly enunciated at the just concluded Doha\nministerial meeting. Trinidad and Tobago therefore\nwelcomes the agreement reached at that meeting to\nmake special and differential treatment operationally\neffective to facilitate development and to ensure that\nmodalities for further commitments, including\nprovisions for special and differential treatment, are\nestablished by 31 March 2003. We also welcome\nagreement on a work programme to examine issues\nrelated to the trade of small economies for the fuller\nintegration of small and vulnerable economies into the\nmultilateral trading system. We will remain actively\nengaged as the process unfolds.\nTo Trinidad and Tobago, as a member of the\nAfrican-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States (ACP), of\ncritical concern, too, is the inordinate and unjustifiable\ndelay in granting the waiver request for the ACP/\nEuropean Commission Partnership Agreement. It is an\nissue which has serious systemic implications for the\nOrganization and it is for this reason that Trinidad and\n27\n\nTobago, like fellow ACP members, considered it\nimperative that it be addressed at the ministerial\nconference.\nIn the sphere of health, no one would dispute that\na real connection exists between a nation\u2019s\ndevelopment capacity and the health of its people. In\nthis regard, my Government has noted with special\ninterest the call to strengthen the resolve adopted at the\nMillennium Summit to halt and reverse the spread of\nHIV/AIDS by 2015. At the heart of our concern is the\nfact that the Caribbean region ranks second among the\nregions of the world where AIDS is the leading cause\nof death in the 15 to 44 age group, a distinction our\nregion can ill afford to bear.\nTrinidad and Tobago again demonstrated its own\ncommitment to international efforts by hosting last\nmonth the Tenth International Conference for People\nLiving with HIV/AIDS. Further, Trinidad and Tobago\nwas among those countries specially selected to\nparticipate in phase II of the HIV/AIDS vaccine trials,\nwhich aims to develop a safe, affordable and accessible\nvaccine. The Government, too, has successfully\nnegotiated with pharmaceutical companies a 90 per\ncent reduction in the cost of antiretroviral drugs.\nTrinidad and Tobago also supports the establishment of\nthe Global Fund for AIDS and Health. As a member of\nthe Transitional Working Group of the Fund, we will\nseek to ensure that, in the modalities of the Fund,\naccession will not be burdensome and bureaucratic and\nthat special consideration will be given to the most\nseriously affected countries.\nAnother element in the pervading cycle of\nunderdevelopment is the presence of persistent poverty.\nTrinidad and Tobago fully supports the call of heads of\nState and Government at the Millennium Summit to\nstrive to cut in half by 2015 the proportion of people\nliving in extreme poverty. At the State level, Trinidad\nand Tobago\u2019s progress in the area of poverty\neradication is illustrated by the high ranking it has\nenjoyed since 1977 in the United Nations Human\nDevelopment Index.\nLikewise, Trinidad and Tobago remains\ncommitted to the agreement on the economic and\nenvironmental goals of the United Nations. We\ntherefore welcome the agreements reached at the sixth\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nespecially the establishment of a special climate fund, a\nfund for least developed countries and the Kyoto\nProtocol adaptation fund to be established in order to\nfinance concrete adaptation projects and programmes.\nWe now encourage developed countries to ratify the\nProtocol so that it can enter into force as quickly as\npossible.\nAs a small island State which relies heavily on\nthe marine environment for our petroleum, natural gas,\nfishing and tourism industries, we are also committed\nto upholding the principles and fulfilling the\nobligations of the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea. We support the work of the\nInternational Seabed Authority in respect of the\ndevelopment and exploitation of minerals of the deep\nseabed for the benefit all humankind. In our quest to\nensure the preservation of the marine environment, we\nreiterate that the question of the transhipment of\nhazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea is a cause\nof deep concern to the region since, in many instances,\nthe marine environment constitutes the only\nmeaningful resource on which some States depend for\ntheir very economic existence.\nAgainst a landscape of differing stages of\ndevelopment, of differing cultural perspectives and of\ndisparate and competing interests, what does emerge is\nan undeniable strength of purpose within this body that\nunites us all in a shared commitment not only to\nimproving the standard of human life, but to preserving\nit at all costs. Harnessing this strength of purpose\nultimately depends on every Member State\u2019s\nappreciating its inherent value and the value it adds by\nits participation in the work of forums such as these. It\nis for this reason that we must continue the dialogue,\nalbeit more vigorously, to ensure that the interests of\npeace and security are better served. Reform of the\nSecurity Council must therefore be advanced in a\nmeaningful way. Democratization of the Security\nCouncil will require more equitable representation.\nThis goal can be accomplished only through the\nexpansion of the Council in both the permanent and the\nnon-permanent categories.\nThe task before us is not insurmountable. We\nmust deepen the dialogue to accelerate implementation\nof the goals defined at the Millennium Summit and\nspecified in the various global conferences and reviews\nwhich have taken place to date. We must ensure that\nthe process of implementation is conducted within a\nspirit of equity and justice. Equal attention must be\ngiven to all groups of countries, developed and\n28\n\ndeveloping, large and small, landlocked, transit and\nsmall island developing States. Trinidad and Tobago\nremains fully committed to this process. Let us make\nthis fifty-sixth session one of defining the process of\nimplementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

During\nthis time of grief and sadness, our sympathies are with\nthose who lost their loved ones.\nIt is with great pleasure that I extend to the\nPresident and his country, the Republic of Korea, the\nwarmest congratulations of my delegation on his\nelection to the presidency of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We are\nconfident that under his able leadership, we will have a\nvery productive session. The President can rest assured\nof the full cooperation of the delegation of Botswana in\nthe discharge of the noble task entrusted to him.\nI should also like to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. The skilful\nmanner in which he guided our deliberations during the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly speaks for\nhis wealth of diplomatic experience and diligence in\nhis work.\nTo our Secretary-General, may I express the full\nsupport and confidence of my delegation as he begins a\nsecond term of office. We congratulate him for the\nhighly esteemed Nobel Peace Prize for 2001, bestowed\njointly on him and the United Nations system. This\nspecial award is not only to the Secretary-General,\npersonally, but also to the many dedicated men and\nwomen who continue to work tirelessly for the United\nNations system.\nIt is regrettable that even as we are assembled\nhere to forge a common future within the same walls\nwhere just 12 months ago our leaders proclaimed the\narrival of a brave new world full of hope and promise,\nour attention should be drawn to acts of international\nterrorism not far from where we are meeting.\nMy delegation wishes to add its voice to those of\nother speakers who have condemned, in the strongest\nlanguage possible, the bombings that occurred in New\nYork and Washington, resulting in a huge loss of\nhuman life. Immediately after learning of these attacks,\nmy Government issued a statement in which we\ncondemned these terrorist attacks and those who\nconceived and perpetrated them. A unified and\nconcerted effort is required from the international\ncommunity in order to wipe the scourge of\ninternational terrorism from the face of the earth, once\nand for all.\n7\n\nAmong other things, we need to reaffirm our\ncommitment to the full implementation of all\nconventions on combating terrorism. My delegation is\nconvinced that the international community\ncollectively has the resources necessary to win the war\nagainst terrorism. This is a challenge of our age.\nThe other major challenge that presents\nextraordinary danger to humanity is the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, whose devastating impact on our societies\nand our economies, particularly in Africa, is well\ndocumented.\nAccording to recent estimates, of the 36.1 million\npeople living with HIV globally, 25.3 million are in\nsub-Saharan Africa. Of the 5.3 million people infected\nwith the virus during 2000, 3.8 million were in sub-\nSaharan Africa. Of the 3.0 million people who died of\nHIV/AIDS in 2000, 2.4 million were in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. These statistics present an extremely grim\npicture of the HIV/AIDS situation in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. As delegates are no doubt aware, my country is\none of the worst affected on the continent. Unless we\njoin forces to tackle this pandemic, it will continue to\nhave a devastating impact on our societies and\neconomies. Funding for the HIV/AIDS programmes is\ngrossly inadequate and has to be increased in order to\nmitigate the impact of the scourge.\nIndeed, the twenty-sixth special session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly underscored the\nimperative of intensified global action to combat the\npandemic. The Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fund\ncould not have come at a more opportune time. It is our\nsincere hope, therefore, that the donor community will\nrespond positively to the financing of the trust fund.\nI want to stress the need to strengthen the role of\nthe United Nations in this fight. Our efforts for the\nprevention and treatment of the disease need to be\naugmented and strengthened by concrete measures of\nsupport and resources from the international\ncommunity if we are to turn the tide of the spread of\nHIV/AIDS.\nThe third issue I wish to highlight is that of\n\u201cconflict diamonds\u201d versus \u201cdevelopment diamonds\u201d.\nBotswana deplores the fact that diamond resources in a\nnumber of countries in Africa are being plundered by\nrebels to purchase weapons that are used to cause\nenormous suffering to innocent people.\nHowever, I want to underscore the fact that\n\u201cconflict diamonds\u201d constitute only 4 per cent or less\nof the world trade in diamonds. Legitimate, conflict-\nfree diamonds, such as those produced in my country,\nare used to generate socio-economic growth and\ndevelopment. I am glad that the contribution of\nconflict-free diamonds to the economic growth of\ncountries such as mine, and indeed of other countries in\nSouthern Africa, is being appreciated.\nWe have been active participants in the Kimberly\nProcess, in which Governments of diamond-producing\ncountries of Southern Africa and other interested\nGovernments, the diamond industry and civil society\norganizations are working together to institute a\ncertification scheme designed to eliminate that small\npercentage of conflict diamonds from world trade. We\nsincerely want to see the suffering inflicted upon the\npeople of Angola, Sierra Leone, the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo and others brought to an end.\nRegrettably, many more countries in our\ncontinent continue to be torn apart by war and conflict.\nWe applaud the efforts of the United Nations and other\ninternational players to enhance the capacity of African\ncountries to prevent conflict and maintain peace and\nstability in the continent. We are convinced that the\ndetermination of many in Africa to consolidate\ndemocracy will go a long way towards ensuring that\nconditions of security and stability are instituted\nthroughout the continent. The establishment of the\nAfrican Union, which will be launched next year in the\nRepublic of South Africa, is the most positive\nexpression of a new solidarity, based on an urgent\nsearch for collective economic security and political\npartnership. Without underestimating the hurdles we\nstill face as we move our continent towards integration,\nit is our fervent belief that an era of hope has been\nushered in on our continent.\nThe most talked about undertaking by Africa in\nrecent weeks has been the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is aimed at achieving\nsocio-economic development by alleviating poverty as\nwell as promoting peace, security, democracy and good\ngovernance. Unlike other initiatives that came before\nit, the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development\nchallenges African countries to take primary\nresponsibility for their own development by ushering in\na political environment guaranteeing peace, security\nand stability, respect for human rights, democratic\nprinciples and the rule of law.\n8\n\nThe initiative underscores the need for a policy\nframework and, indeed, regulatory structures that will\nenhance governance in Africa. I must say, all of these\nare achievable objectives, and we as a continent have\nunreservedly committed ourselves, our Governments\nand peoples, and the required resources to their\nattainment. We also believe that the initiative will\nusher in a new concept of technical cooperation\nbetween Africa and our development partners, and that\nthe United Nations will have a critical role to play in\nits implementation.\nMy delegation attaches importance to the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, scheduled to be held in Mexico in the\nspring of 2002, and the forthcoming World Summit on\nSustainable Development, to be held in South Africa in\nSeptember 2002. These Conferences will offer us an\nopportunity to examine issues of development in a\nholistic and pragmatic manner. Issues of environment,\ntrade, domestic policy-making, international\ncooperation and partnership with the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions, as well as the private sector, will have to\nfeature prominently at these conferences.\nRecent developments in Sierra Leone give us\nhope that peace will now be given a chance in that\ncountry. The agreement between the Government\nand the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which will\nsee the latter transformed into a political party, is a\nmajor achievement and an important step forward. The\nRUF must now translate its promises into action,\nbecause this is the only way that the international\ncommunity will be able to provide the much needed\nsupport for the holding of the envisaged national\nelections, which will provide the basis for the\nrestoration of peace and stability in Sierra Leone.\nThere is a real window of opportunity for peace\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After many\nyears of bloody conflict, which has inflicted immense\nsuffering on the people of the Congo, the political\nplayers and other stakeholders have embarked on a\nnational dialogue that should bring peace to the\ncountry. I would like to underline the fact that\ndedication and perseverance will be required on the\npart of those concerned in order for the inter-Congolese\ndialogue to be crowned with success. We therefore urge\nthe players to see the process of negotiations through,\nbecause the alternative is to slide back down into the\nsuffering and misery that the Congolese have endured\nfor so long. I also wish to call upon the international\ncommunity to provide the necessary support and\nresources to the Office of the Facilitator, former\nPresident Sir Ketumile Masire, to enable the\nfacilitation process of the inter-Congolese dialogue to\nsucceed.\nThe peace process in Burundi is moving in the\nright direction after many years of painful war. The\ndeal brokered by former President Mandela has\nprovided a way out of the stalemate. The resolve of the\nparties to remain committed to the peace process is the\nonly way forward.\nWe continue to be concerned that prospects for\npeace in Angola remain distant. At the heart of the\nimpasse are UNITA\u2019s continuing acts of destabilization\nand sabotage. UNITA must understand that there can\nbe no military solution to the crisis in Angola. We\ntherefore wish to appeal to UNITA to reconsider its\nposition and choose the path of dialogue.\nMy delegation is seriously concerned at the\nrecent escalation of violence in the Middle East. It is\nour sincere hope that the Government of Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority will recognize the urgent need to\nresume negotiations towards a comprehensive peace\nagreement. A lasting solution to this problem is\nessential.\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm my country\u2019s\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter. We are committed to working\nwith others to strengthen this Organization in order to\nsurmount the challenges that face us all as nations and\npeoples across the globe. The United Nations is our\nonly hope for a stable and prosperous world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you,\nSir, on your unanimous election as President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. I would also like to extend my sincere\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\nGeneral, for his re-election to a second term in office\nand for the richly deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded\nto him and the United Nations Organization. This is an\nacknowledgement of his tireless efforts in the service\nof mankind and, as the Secretary-General has said, of a\nchallenge to do better and, I hope, faster. I would like\nto assure the Secretary-General of my Government\u2019s\ncooperation and firm commitment in that regard.\nThe achievements of the United Nations\nOrganization are many and varied, while its increasing\nrelevance in an ever more complex international\nenvironment is clear to us. Its objectives are still as\nvalid and noble today as they were 56 years ago and, I\nbelieve, can only be achieved by our continued\ncommitment, careful vigilance and firm action.\nI would now like to turn my attention to an issue\nthat is uppermost in my mind and that has changed the\nway we live and do business, maybe forever. I am\nreferring to the terrorist attacks on the United States of\nAmerica, an important, worthy and respected Member\nof the United Nations Organization and a long-standing\nand trusted friend of Kenya.\nTerrorism poses a real threat to international\npeace and security and must be condemned by people\nof good will throughout the world. Terrorism cannot be\njustified in any form whatsoever. No philosophy,\nreligion or creed can allow the taking away of innocent\nlives and the destruction of valuable property. The\npeople of Kenya experienced first-hand the devastating\neffects of terrorism in August 1998. The attack on\nKenya, a country faced with challenges of poverty and\nunderdevelopment, was especially severe and continues\nto affect us. Kenya understands well the pain of those\n4\n\naffected by the recent attacks in the United States of\nAmerica and fully supports the efforts being led by the\nPresident of the United States of America, Mr. George\nW. Bush, and his administration to fight terrorism in all\nits forms.\nIn order to carry out one of its fundamental\nobjectives, that of the maintenance of international\npeace and security, the United Nations, and in\nparticular its membership, must intensify efforts to\nresolve all outstanding and persistent conflicts raging\nin many parts of the world. We the Member States of\nthe United Nations must work very closely to ensure\nthat we completely disable the terrorist machinery. We\nmust particularly support the coalition against\nterrorism.\nAs an Organization, we must address the issue of\nconflicts seriously. Conflict situations impede\ndevelopment, provide an atmosphere for the illegal\nexploitation of resources, the abuse of children, the\ninflux of refugees, the spread of dangerous weapons\nand the deepening of poverty, to mention just a few\naspects. Conflicts steal the dreams, hopes, aspirations\nand opportunities of many, many people, especially\nchildren. We must intensify our efforts in the search for\nthe peaceful and speedy resolution of conflicts.\nThe conflicts in Africa continue to destabilize our\ncontinent. The United Nations and its membership\nmust intensify efforts to find solutions to the conflicts.\nThe peaceful resolution of conflicts is a\nfundamental tenet of Kenya\u2019s foreign policy. It is a\nmatter of record that I have spared no effort throughout\nmy political career in search of peaceful solutions to\nconflicts in our region and elsewhere. Currently, Kenya\nis involved in peace negotiations in southern Sudan,\nSomalia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. We would like more international involvement\nin peace efforts in Africa.\nThe biggest challenge facing the African\ncontinent today is the increasing level of poverty.\nPoverty has become an obstacle, a roadblock to every\neffort we are making at improving the overall welfare\nof our people.\nPoverty is a fertile breeding ground for conflict\nand instability, and even terrorism. It is therefore\nregrettable that very little progress, if any, has been\nmade since the World Summit for Social Development,\nheld in Copenhagen in 1995. I remind members that the\nmain outcome of that Summit was the resolve to\neradicate poverty as an obstacle to human\ndevelopment.\nWe cannot succeed in improving the lives of our\npeople without the wholehearted engagement of the\ninternational community. The global target of reducing\npoverty by half by the year 2015 cannot be achieved\nwithout tangible availability of resources.\nOur efforts at attacking poverty are further\nundermined by the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other\ntreatable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which\nhave the potential of reversing all the socio-economic\ngains we have worked so hard to achieve.\nI applaud the Secretary-General for organizing a\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS earlier this year. The\nestablishment of the Global AIDS Fund is a very\nwelcome development. I look forward to its\ncontribution and active participation in our daily\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS. Kenya calls on the\ninternational community to lend its full support to the\nfund.\nThe effect of marginalization on developing\ncountries posed by the accelerated process of\nglobalization must be addressed as a matter of priority.\nIt is my hope that the Fourth World Trade Organization\nMinisterial Conference in Doha, Qatar, will address the\nissue of the imbalance in international trade more\neffectively. The issue of meaningful market access,\nparticularly for agricultural products, must be resolved\nquickly. Protectionist policies are in no country's\ninterest and definitely contradict the principles of free\ntrade and the process of liberalization. In addition,\nresources must be made available to the World Trade\nOrganization by our partners to enable it to provide\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building to\ndeveloping countries.\nSolutions in the form of better terms of trade and\nmarket access must go hand-in-hand with the flow of\nforeign direct investment to developing countries.\nMany African countries have taken bold initiatives to\nprovide a conducive environment for investors. These\nefforts need to be supported by clear policies of\ndeveloped countries to encourage private sector\ninvestment in Africa.\nWe urgently need to be freed from the burdens\nthat are diverting vital resources from our economic\ndevelopment. Debt relief is necessary. It is in our\n5\n\ncommon interest that our economies be restored to\nhealth in a meaningful time frame.\nMy concluding remarks relate to the desire for\nequity, fair play and justice for all. This is one of the\ncardinal objectives of the United Nations. I welcome\nthe efforts that the Organization has made in the pursuit\nof these objectives.\nWe welcome these efforts. Yet it is a matter of\nconcern that commitments in the programmes of action\nagreed upon have not been fully complied with. This\nsituation must be reversed. My challenge to the\nOrganization is that these commitments be honoured so\nthat humanity can feel that the United Nations is truly\nan organization of hope for many nations and peoples\nthroughout the world. We cannot continue doing what\nhas so far failed. We need to work on new ways of\naddressing our common problems. My Government\nstands ready to do its part, and I challenge other\nGovernments to do theirs. Together we shall succeed in\nmeeting our commitments to have poverty reduced by\nhalf by 2015.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to join\nother representatives in congratulating you, Sir, on\nyour unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\n27\n\nunder your able guidance the work of this General\nAssembly session will be another milestone on the new\ninternational scene, particularly in confronting the new\nchallenges facing our world, especially after the\nextremely tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September on\nthe World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon\nin Washington, D.C.\nI believe that the world has completely changed\nsince the attacks against the United States of America,\nthe deadliest terrorist attacks ever committed, in which\nso many innocent lives were lost. These acts of\nterrorism shook the world as the images of destruction\nwere broadcast live. They were undoubtedly crimes\nagainst humanity. We must strongly condemn these\nterrorist acts. We cannot forget those who lost their\nlives and the families of the victims. In this regard, I\nwish to extend, on behalf of the people and the Royal\nGovernment of Cambodia, our most sincere\ncondolences to the families of the innocent victims and\nthe Government of the United States of America.\nCambodia fully supports the United Nations\nresolutions condemning the acts of terrorism against\nthe United States. Cambodia also fully endorses the\ninternational efforts in combating terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations. Cambodia is disturbed,\nhowever, over the loss of innocent civilian lives as a\nresult of the bombings in Afghanistan. We must do\neverything possible to avoid civilian casualties and loss\nof life.\nIn order to find solutions to the current problems\nfacing our world, I believe that we need to look into\nnot only the root causes of terrorism but also the other\ncontributing factors that are confronting the world\ntoday. First, we need to look for a just and lasting\npeace in the Middle East, in particular a solution to the\nPalestine problem. We need to respect the fundamental\nright of self-determination of the Palestinian people. In\nthis regard, Cambodia supports the creation of a\nPalestinian State as early as possible. One may argue\nthat the present situation in the world may have opened\na window of opportunity for finding solutions to the\nongoing conflict in the Middle East. I believe that all\nparties concerned should, and I hope that they will,\ngive peace in the region a chance, which is the way to\novercome the lingering conflict in the region.\nSecondly, the increase in poverty in the world is\nanother crucial problem that must be addressed with\nsome sense of urgency and collective responsibility.\nPoverty is unquestionably one of the major causes of\nthe problems in the world today. I think that all nations\nmust join hands to fight poverty throughout the world.\nAt the same time, we must work to reduce the\nwidening gap between the developed and developing\ncountries.\nIn this regard, it is important for us to recall last\nyear\u2019s Millennium Declaration, whose main thrust was\na war on poverty in the most comprehensive and most\ninclusive manner possible. For the developing\ncountries, one of the main challenges in the war on\npoverty is managing the negative side of an irreversible\nprocess of globalization. The key question is how to\nbest integrate ourselves into an ever-accelerating\nprocess of globalization so that the developing\ncountries will not be left out or continue to be further\nmarginalized. The process of globalization is a reality\nwithout precedent, and no country in this world is\nimmune to, or able to opt out of, the process.\nAt the same time, we should work collectively\ntowards minimizing the negative impact of\nglobalization, which would enable the developing\ncountries to pursue sustainable development and\npoverty reduction and provide the necessary tools for\nthe people to improve their standards of living.\nMoreover, we think that if there is no mechanism or\nprinciple which is universally accepted in order to\nmanage globalization, the gap between the developed\nand developing countries will further widen in the\nfuture. This is a problem of human security, which the\ninternational community must consider finding\nappropriate ways and means of addressing.\nThirdly, another side effect of poverty is the\ngrowing epidemic of HIV/AIDS worldwide, across\nregions and continents, affecting mostly the poor and\nthe developing countries. Therefore, we believe that\nthe rich, developed countries should do more to help in\nthe fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.\nFourthly, as a contributing factor for combating\nterrorism, we should attempt to find practical solutions\nto the growing threat of the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and the illegal trade of small arms and light\nweapons around the globe. In this context, Cambodia\nfully agrees with the Secretary-General\u2019s statement at\nthe Millennium Summit that the issues of nuclear\nweapons and illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons should be given the highest priority on the\nUnited Nations agenda in the area of arms control and\n28\n\ndisarmament. In this context, Cambodia wishes to call\nupon all countries to respect all the nuclear-weapons-\nrelated treaties, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile\n(ABM) Treaty. Cambodia strongly believes that the\ninternational community should work towards a\ngradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a minimal\nlevel, and non-proliferation and non-production of such\nweapons in the future, which should be the basis for\nbuilding and maintaining a peaceful, safe and nuclear-\nfree world.\n(spoke in French)\nAs a country that has suffered considerably from\nthe proliferation of small arms, Cambodia welcomes\nthe adoption of the Programme of Action at the\nconclusion of the United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects. In this regard, I congratulate the United\nNations on taking bold steps in addressing this vitally\nimportant issue. Since 1998, the Royal Government of\nCambodia has carried out a nationwide campaign to\naddress the problems regarding such arms. So far more\nthat 120,000 small arms and light weapons have been\nconfiscated, and more than 50 percent of them have\nbeen destroyed in the framework of an operation\nnamed \u201cFlames for Peace.\u201d\nFifthly, for the United Nations to play a greater\nrole in addressing the increasing number of complex\nproblems that are now arising, the Kingdom of\nCambodia is of the view that the General Assembly\nand the Security Council must be reformed so that they\nbecome more effective and more efficient. As we may\nrecall, one of the most important pledges contained in\nlast year\u2019s Millennium Declaration was the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. While progress\nin the structural and procedural aspects of the General\nAssembly are vitally important, we must not lose sight\nof the primary objective of this exercise, which is to\nreturn to the General Assembly its original function as\nthe chief deliberative and representative body of the\nUnited Nations. In other words, the international\ncommunity, especially the United Nations as a whole,\nmust play a constructive and proactive role, without\nexclusivity, including in the struggle against terrorism.\nI also believe that the current global situation\njustifies a call for a constructive and timely reform of\nthe Security Council, which must reflect the realities\nand needs of the world today. The Security Council\nmust be reformed to be made more representative,\nmore democratic and more effective in its decision-\nmaking processes. Its membership and structure,\npassed down since 1945, are inarguably outdated and\nno longer reflect the political, economic, social and\ndemographic realities of our time or, apparently, the\ngrowing issues of human security.\nAs the United Nations Charter mandates the\nSecurity Council\u2019s responsibility in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, it is important for us\nto ensure that the interests of all nations are sufficiently\nreflected in the Council\u2019s composition and voting\nprocedures. It is unacceptable, however, that the two\nthirds of the world\u2019s population residing in the\ndeveloping countries are not equitably represented in\nthe Council. Such practices could jeopardize the\nCouncil\u2019s credibility in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. In this regard,\nCambodia supports the decision of the non-aligned\ncountries in favour of an additional increase in the\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members and\nin particular reiterates its strong support for Japan,\nGermany and India as candidates for permanent\nmembership of the Security Council.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that we are living in a\nfast-changing world in which the rapid pace of\nglobalization and growing interdependence are the\norder of the day. Peace, stability and prosperity are\ninterrelated and affect all nations and peoples on this\nplanet, especially following the extremely tragic\nterrorist attacks in September. It is therefore essential\nthat we work together to build a genuine community of\nnations in which the gap between the developed and\nthe developing countries is reduced; in which the threat\nof terrorism and nuclear annihilation are eliminated; in\nwhich the danger of a global HIV/AIDS epidemic is\nmitigated; and in which poverty is alleviated. This can\ncome about only through the development of a more\ngenuine cooperation, the fostering of enhanced mutual\nrespect, the cultivation of greater tolerance, the\npromotion of better understanding and the emergence\nof a broader spirit of true union among nations in a\nworld that works on behalf of all.\nI strongly believe that we can achieve all this\nthrough collective will and actions that will help us to\nusher in a new and brighter future for our world \u2014 a\nworld free of terrorism, a world of stability, peace,\n29\n\nsecurity, development and prosperity for all peoples in\nthe twenty-first century.\n\nFinally, I am pleased to express, on behalf of the\nRoyal Government of Cambodia, our very warm\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to\na second term in the noble post of Secretary-General. I\ndo believe that, with his dedication and long-standing\nexperience in dealing with the many challenges faced\nby the United Nations, the Secretary-General will\ncertainly achieve more success for the sake of peace\nand stability for all nations Members of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great\npleasure, on behalf of my country, to congratulate\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly. His election to that high office\n29\n\ndemonstrates the international community's respect for\nand confidence in his ability to guide the work of this\nsession successfully. It also demonstrates the trust and\nhigh regard that the international community has for\nthe Republic of Korea and for the important role that\ncountry is playing in the international arena to foster\npeace and security in the world. I would also like to\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for the\nexemplary manner in which he guided the work of the\nfifty-fifth session.\nAllow me also to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, on his\nreappointment to head the Organization for a second\nterm. His dynamic leadership has earned the United\nNations the confidence of the international community\nand has raised fresh hopes about the Organization's\nability to facilitate a world atmosphere more conducive\nto peace, justice and human dignity as we enter the\ntwenty-first century. The award of the Nobel Peace\nPrize to the Secretary-General and to the United\nNations is testimony to that confidence.\nNearly 13 years ago, the Maldives woke up to the\nhorrors of terrorism when a band of foreign terrorists\nattacked Male, our capital island, without the slightest\nwarning or provocation, killing many innocent people\nand destroying property. By their faceless act of\nviolence, they changed the peaceful life we had had in\nour country for centuries into one full of fear and\napprehension.\nOn 11 September this year, the most powerful\ncountry, the United States of America, itself became a\ntarget and the victim of a horrendous act of terrorism.\nThe world community was shocked and promptly\ncondemned the barbaric attacks on the World Trade\nCenter and the Pentagon, and the murder of thousands\nof innocent people. Consistent with its stand against\nterrorism, the Maldives found itself among the first\nStates to condemn those attacks in the strongest\npossible terms.\nThe tragedy of 11 September has reminded us\nthat terrorism is one of the biggest challenges facing\nthe world community today. It has emerged as an\nenemy of nations, be they large or small, and as a\nvicious threat to humanity. In combating such a cruel\nenemy, it is important that international action against\nterrorism be supported and that it be complemented by\nmeasures at the regional and national levels.\nAt the international level, the legal doctrine\nagainst all aspects of terrorism must be strengthened\nand universalized. Concomitantly, action at the\nregional and national levels must be brought into line\nwith international obligations in fighting this global\nmenace. The United Nations, as the global organization\nresponsible for international peace and security, must\nplay the pivotal role in this fight against terrorism. My\ncountry fully supports the early convening of a high-\nlevel conference, under the auspices of the United\nNations, to formulate a clear definition of terrorism and\nto draw up a joint, far-sighted reaction to the ever-\ngrowing phenomena of terrorism in its various forms\nand manifestations. We are also looking forward to the\nearly conclusion of a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism and of an international\nconvention for the prevention of acts of terrorism using\nnuclear, biological or chemical material or agents.\nAs a people who have devoted themselves to the\npractice of Islamic faith and values for nearly a\nmillennium, we are deeply offended by the notion that\nterrorism is linked to Islam or to Muslims. On the\ncontrary, Islam advocates peace, compassion, tolerance\nand peaceful coexistence. The projection and portrayal\nof Islam as an enemy of civilization or of the free\nworld is an insult to its noble principles. It is a\nperverted view and a falsification of Islam and its\nprinciples. Such perversions are nothing but\npropaganda hatched by evil people who wish to breed\nhatred among human beings; their claims are no less\nharmful than terrorism itself.\nAt the Millennium Summit last year, our leaders\ncharted a course for a better world, a world in which\nthe whole of humanity can prosper in mutual respect\nand dignity. Navigating smoothly along that course will\nbe a difficult task. We have to be ready to boldly\naddress the challenges in our way.\nOver the past year, we met in several special\nsessions to address some specific important issues. On\neach and every such occasion, we demonstrated our\nfirm resolve to uphold the objectives set forth in the\nMillennium Declaration. The major cross-cutting\ntheme that runs deep in all these issues is the\ndehumanizing scourge of poverty. Poverty remains the\nmajor stumbling block for sustainable social and\neconomic development in the developing world.\nEradicating poverty, therefore, is core to the attainment\nof peace and development. Let us therefore make the\nelimination of poverty our top priority and pursue\n30\n\nvigorously the target set by our leaders during the\nMillennium Summit: to halve poverty by 2015.\nThe commitments we have undertaken at such\nconferences involve high price tags. Unless new and\nadditional financial resources are made available in a\ntimely and predictable manner, no action plans or\nprogrammes can be implemented. It is therefore a\ncollective responsibility of the entire international\ncommunity, including the private-sector stakeholders\nand civil society, to muster the necessary political will\nthat is so vital in this regard. We are eagerly looking\nforward to the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development to be held in Mexico early next year.\nWe hope that that event will provide the international\ncommunity with an opportunity to agree on new,\ninnovative and additional sources and strategies to\nmobilize funds for development.\nGlobalization is now a reality. Many in the\ndeveloped world are enjoying the unprecedented yield\nof globalization, while its powerful forces are\ndepressing the fragile economies of many developing\nand least developed countries, including structurally\nweak countries. The uneven playing field has indeed\ncontributed to widening the gap between the rich and\nthe poor. In fact, the obstacles to the development of\nthe least developed countries have grown in number\nand magnitude over the years and have marginalized\nthose countries in the world economy. My country, the\nMaldives, is heartened by the goodwill and solidarity\nextended by the international community to the least\ndeveloped countries during the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries held in\nBrussels early this year. It is now time for delivery on\nthe commitments made at the Brussels Conference.\nUnless those commitments are fulfilled, the plight of\nthe least developed countries will continue to worsen.\nThe special circumstances and needs of the small\nisland developing States (SIDS) have been recognized\nand acknowledged by this Assembly on numerous\noccasions. The Barbados Programme of Action very\nclearly spells out these special needs of SIDS.\nAlthough many SIDS may appear to be relatively more\nprosperous on the basis of per capita income level, it is\nalso a documented fact that, due to the special\ncharacteristics of small islands, they are generally\namong the most economically vulnerable and\nhandicapped countries in the world today.\nAs a country with little more than a quarter of a\nmillion inhabitants spread over more than 200 islands,\nbereft of natural resources and with a fragile economy\nbased on fisheries and tourism, which are sensitive to\nthe harsh realities of ecology and the environment, the\nMaldives provides a perfect example of this dilemma\nof the small island developing States.\nThe stable political environment that the\nMaldives has enjoyed for the past two decades,\ncombined with the continued flow of assistance from\nour development partners, have indeed given us the\nopportunity to improve the quality of life of our\npeople. Our efforts towards development have\nremained relentless, as the structural constraints we\nface are both persistent and formidable.\nGiven these realities, my country is convinced\nthat the present criteria for identifying least developed\ncountries need to be refined to reflect the impediments\nin full. We appeal to the Committee for Development\nPolicy and the international community to consider\nthese realities on the ground and to look beyond\nabstract indicators into the inherent vulnerabilities of\nsmall island developing States in determining the\ncriteria for graduation.\nWe do not wish to remain indefinitely in the\ncategory of least developed countries. However, should\ngraduation be thrust upon us prematurely, its negative\nconsequences could easily overwhelm us and result in\nserious erosion of our achievements. We need to\nstrengthen the capacity of our human resources and\ninstitutions to cope with existing and emerging\nchallenges to our development efforts. We need to find\nways and means to diversify our economic base and\nstrengthen its sustainability.\nWe welcome the recent resolution adopted by the\nEconomic and Social Council to extend our transition\nperiod until the next triennial review of the list of least\ndeveloped countries in 2003. At the same time, we\nwish to reiterate our belief that ensuring a smooth\ntransition for graduating countries, in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 46/206, is an essential\nobligation of the entire international community.\nIndeed, a decision that affects the future destiny of a\nnation should not be based on hastily compiled\ninformation that may contain erroneous assumptions\nand dubious facts that could mislead the competent\nauthorities, leading them to reach questionable\nconclusions.\n31\n\nThe state of the global environment remains a\nmajor concern of the international community. A\ndecade after the adoption of Agenda 21, its effective\nimplementation has proven to be a difficult task. The\npleas of small island developing States for new and\nadditional resources to implement the Barbados\nProgramme of Action remain to be heeded. The Kyoto\nProtocol is yet to come into force. Meanwhile,\nscientific predictions on the future of the global\nenvironment remain alarming. Unless swift and\nconcrete action is forthcoming, global environmental\ndegradation will continue to threaten the survival of\nhumankind and our planet. The consequences of a mere\none-metre rise in the mean sea level on small island\ndeveloping States, such as the Maldives, is now a well-\ndocumented fact. We, therefore, urge the international\ncommunity to accelerate its efforts to agree on a legally\nbinding greenhouse gas emissions reduction regime\nand to facilitate the Kyoto Protocol's early entry into\nforce. In this connection, we are encouraged by the\npositive developments achieved in Marrakech last\nweek and hope that these developments will facilitate\nan early entry into force of the Protocol.\nA year from now, we will gather in Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa, for the Rio + 10 Summit to take stock of\nour labour over the past decade to protect and preserve\nthe global environment. My country believes that this\nwould be an excellent opportunity for the international\ncommunity to reinvigorate its efforts and rededicate its\ncommitments to protect and preserve the global\nenvironment.\nThe Maldives attaches great importance to the\nefforts of the international community to foster\nsustainable social development. The five-year review\nof the Copenhagen commitments and Beijing Platform\nfor Action, carried out last year, and the recently\nconcluded review of the implementation of the\noutcome of the Second United Nations Conference on\nHuman Settlements (Habitat Agenda), as well as the\nWorld Conference against Racism and Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nhave added renewed impetus to the efforts of the\ninternational community to achieve social harmony.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a major\nimpediment to social development. The Maldives, too,\nhas not been immune to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\nAlthough the number of cases may be relatively low in\nour country, we are fully aware of the potential threat\nthat looms over us. We pledge our full support to the\nProgramme of Action adopted by the special session of\nthe General Assembly on HIV/AIDS early this year,\nand we call on the international community, including\nthe private sector stakeholders, to commit the financial\nresources required to implement the Programme of\nAction.\nMy country wholeheartedly supports the just\nstruggle of the Palestinian people. My country\ncommends the efforts of the co-sponsors of the Middle\nEast peace process to help put the talks back on track.\nWe strongly believe that the Mitchell report should be\nimplemented urgently to pave the way for restarting the\nstalled peace process.\nDisarmament and arms control measures continue\nto remain a high priority on the international agenda.\nWhile we were encouraged by the positive outcome of\nthe NPT Review Conference last year, we would like to\nreiterate the need for continuing efforts to strengthen\nand enforce the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\nSimilarly, we look forward to the day when the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) will\ncome into force.\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm the firm\ncommitment of the Maldives to the principles and\nobjectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We\nwill work with the other members of the international\ncommunity to uphold and promote these lofty\nobjectives. We remain convinced that the United\nNations is the only organization that is capable of\ncreating a more peaceful and prosperous world for\nhumanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore delivering my statement, I would like to express\nour condolences to the United States, the Dominican\nRepublic and other countries represented here that have\nlost citizens among the many passengers and crew\nmembers who perished in yesterday\u2019s tragic crash of\nAmerican Airlines flight 587, and I hereby extend these\ncondolences to their families.\nThe war in Afghanistan must be stopped. The\nGovernment of the United States must acknowledge\nthat it has made a mistake, and must halt its ineffective,\nunjustifiable bombing campaign against the Afghan\npeople.\nJudging by its results, it would seem that this war\nhas targeted children, the civilian population and the\nhospitals and facilities of the International Committee\nof the Red Cross. As to its methods, no honest voice\nwould be raised in this Hall to defend the endless\nslaughter, with the most sophisticated weaponry, of a\ndispossessed, starving, helpless people. As to its\ndoubtful purposes, this war will never be justified from\nthe point of view of ethics and international law. Those\nresponsible for it will one day be judged by history.\nCuba has opposed this war from the very\nbeginning as an absurd, inefficient method to eradicate\nterrorism, and reiterates that it can only bring more\nhatred and ever-increasing dangers of new actions of\nthis kind. No one has the right to continue murdering\nchildren, aggravating the humanitarian crisis and\nvisiting impoverishment and death on millions of\nrefugees.\nIf the United States obtained a military victory by\neliminating all regular and irregular Afghan\nresistance \u2014 something that is not at all easy in\npractice and extremely costly on a moral level, for it\nwould represent a real genocide without attaining the\nobjective that we must pursue \u2014 the world would be\nfarther away than ever from achieving peace, security\nand the eradication of terrorism.\nCuba\u2019s discourse is not founded on ill feelings\nagainst the country that has been our most pitiless\nadversary for over 40 years. It is inspired by a sincere,\nconstructive spirit and a sense of respect for and\nsympathy towards the people of the United States,\nwhich suffered an unjustifiable and atrocious terrorist\nattack. It is also based on the aspiration for peace and\njustice for all the peoples of the world.\nWhat Cuba expresses in this Hall, with full\nopenness, may not be to the liking of those who run the\nUnited States today, but it will be understood one day\nby the American people, whose generosity and sense of\njustice were proved to the Cuban people when it had\nthe support of 80 percent of the public opinion in this\ncountry in our struggle to prevent a kidnapped Cuban\nchild from being torn away from his family and\nsubjected to ludicrous political manipulations and cruel\npsychological tortures.\nWhat Cuba is saying from this rostrum, as we\nwell know, is what many people have been saying in\nthe corridors of this building. What international\ncoalition are we talking about? What is its legitimacy\nbased on if it has started by scandalously disregarding\nthe General Assembly? The United States has not\nfostered international cooperation. It has rather\nimposed its war on a unilateral basis and has stated in\nan unprecedented way that whoever does not second\nthem is for terrorism. How long will the precarious\nsupport obtained last, since it is not based on\nharmonized objectives and voluntary agreement, but on\nthe imposition of will through threats and pressures?\nYou can be the strongest, but not necessarily\nright. You can inspire dread, but not sympathy and\nrespect. Only from genuine international\ncooperation \u2014 in which all countries, big and small,\nparticipate with a full understanding of everyone\u2019s\npositions, with broadmindedness and tolerance in the\n21\n\nmethods used, within the framework of the United\nNations and the strict respect for the principles\nenshrined in its Charter \u2014 can a truly effective and\nlasting alliance emerge to fight terrorism.\nThe world was surprised to learn of the official\nannouncement of the United States to the Security\nCouncil that it reserved the right to decide on an attack\nagainst other countries in the future. What is left of the\nCharter after this? Can this unprecedented threat by\nany chance be interpreted as an exercise of the right to\nlegitimate defence, enshrined in the Charter as the right\nof a State to deal with acts of aggression until the\nCouncil adopts the necessary measures, and not as a\nvulgar excuse to unleash attacks against other\ncountries? Is this announcement, or is it not, the\nproclamation of the right of a super-Power to trample\nupon the still fragile and incomplete standards that\nprotect the sovereignty, security and rights of peoples?\nCuba calmly and firmly rejects that language. We\nhave not done so out of concern for our own security,\nbecause there is no power in the world that can subdue\nour spirit of independence, freedom and social justice\nand the courage to defend it at any cost. We did so,\nbecause we believe that it is still possible to halt the\nescalation of a useless, brutal war that threatens to\nfurther plunge into hopelessness, insecurity and death\nthe poor peoples of the planet, who are by no means\nresponsible for any act of terrorism, but will be \u2014 and\nalready are \u2014 the main victims of this senselessness.\nOnly under the leadership of the United Nations\nwill we be able to defeat terrorism. Cooperation, and\nnot war, is the way. The coordination of actions, and\nnot the imposition of will, is the method. Our objective\nmust be to obliterate terrorism by removing its root\ncauses \u2014 and not the hegemonic assertion of the\nstrength of a super-Power, thus turning us into\naccomplices to its arrogance and arbitrariness.\nTherefore, Cuba \u2014 which has already responded\nto the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal by deciding to\nimmediately ratify all of the international legal\ninstruments on terrorism \u2014 resolutely supports the\nadoption of a general convention on international\nterrorism. Of course, this will be possible only in the\ncontext of the General Assembly, which \u2014 though now\ncompletely ignored by those who are promoting the\nnew campaign \u2014 has, over the past 10 years, despite\nthe silence and apathy of the Security Council, adopted\nthe principal resolutions and declarations calling for an\noutright combat against terrorism.\nThis will allow us finally to define terrorism with\naccuracy. We have to prevent attempts from being\nmade by a handful of actors with vested interests to try\nto label as such the right of nations to fight for their\nself-determination or against foreign aggression. It\nmust be clearly established that the support, abetting,\nfinancing or concealment of terrorist actions by a State\nis also an act of terrorism.\nCuba, which is working on its own anti-terrorism\nlaw, which should be in effect shortly, unreservedly\nendorses the proposal to convene an international\nconference on terrorism under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations. This has been a longtime aspiration of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and should enable us, as a\nresult of open discussions, collective action and\nrespectful and non-discriminatory agreement \u2014 and\nnot of threats, terror or force \u2014 to find a way to fully\neliminate terrorism and its causes. Here I am speaking\nof terrorism committed not only against the United\nStates but against any other country \u2014 even if\nemanating from the territory of the United States, or\ntolerated by, or with the complicity of, its authorities,\nas has been Cuba\u2019s painful experience for over four\ndecades.\nOnly four days ago, the Pakistani media\nattributed to a character who is well known and very\nfamiliar to the United States a statement supposedly\nmade from Afghan territory saying that he has\nchemical and nuclear weapons and is threatening to use\nthem against the United States if it uses similar\nweapons against Afghanistan.\nEverybody knows that Afghanistan does not have\nthe slightest ability to produce or launch nuclear or\nchemical weapons. Only a terrorist organization or\nleader could come up with the idea of executing an\naction of this kind using nuclear or chemical weapons.\nOf course, theoretically this could be possible, as a\nconsequence of the irresponsible behaviour of the\nmajor nuclear Powers and as a result of the arms trade,\ncorruption and illegal trafficking in all sorts of military\ntechnology. Indeed, several of those Powers have acted\nas accomplices to, and taken part in, the traffic in\nfissile material and the transfer of nuclear technology,\nas suits their interests. However, in reality, given the\nconditions of war in Afghanistan, it would be\nridiculous to resort to those threats. To do so would be\n22\n\nto show tremendous political and military ignorance. If\none lacked such means, this would be a dangerous\nbluff, and if one did have them, it would be absolute\nmadness to threaten to use them.\nIf the threats contained in the statement published\nby two Pakistani newspapers are true, they deserve the\nstrongest condemnation, as would the eventual use of\nsuch weapons against Afghanistan. That would be a\nstupid reaction, since, under those circumstances, the\nonly thing that poor, suffering country would have to\ngain would be a universal condemnation of the use of\nsuch weapons. Such threats serve only the interests of\nthe extremist and belligerent forces within the United\nStates, which favour the use of the most sophisticated\nweapons of mass destruction against the Afghan\npeople. The best weapon for a country that is the\nvictim of aggression is to earn and keep the sympathy\nof the world, and not to allow anyone to violate the\nethical principle that no one has the right to kill\nchildren, not even if others are doing it. There is no\njustice in killing innocent people to avenge the death of\nother innocents.\nCuba has stated without hesitation that it is\nopposed to terrorism and to war. Cuba, which is not\nunder obligation to anyone, will continue to be\nconsistent in its positions. Truth and ethical\nconsiderations should prevail above all else.\nThe way events have unfolded, the increased\nlevel of hatred and the intensification of passions and\npotential dangers have shown the absolute truth of the\nassertion that war has never been, is not, and never will\nbe the way to eradicate terrorism.\nThe most critical socio-economic crisis ever \u2014\nthe result, halfway through the last decade, of the\nresounding and irreversible failure of neo-liberalism\nand neo-liberal globalization \u2014 has been dramatically\naggravated by this war, which was imposed by one side\nbut whose consequences we all have to bear.\nThis war must be stopped, not only because its\nconsequences for the Afghan civilian population, but\nalso because of the danger of destabilization in that\nregion. It must be stopped in order not only to save\nthousands of Americans \u2014 mostly young \u2014 and\nthousands of Afghans and other nationals from a\nsenseless death, and not only to preserve international\npeace and stability, but because this conflict makes it\nimpossible to achieve the objective set by the United\nNations 15 years ago: the right to development for all,\nand an equal opportunity to attain it, and because it\nrenders obsolete the decision made only a year ago to\nwork together in order to eliminate poverty from the\nface of the Earth.\nWill we be willing to organize a coalition against\npoverty, famine, ignorance, diseases and the scourge of\nAIDS that is currently decimating the African\ncontinent; a coalition for sustainable development, for\nthe preservation of the environment and against the\ndestruction of the planet?\nA coalition has been assembled to avenge the\ngrievous and unjustifiable death of over 4,000 innocent\npeople in the United States. Let us come together to\nseek justice for this great crime \u2014 and let us do so\nwithout war; let us come together to save from death\nthe hundreds of thousands of poor women who die\nduring childbirth every year; let us come together to\nsave from death the 12 million children who die of\npreventable diseases before the age of 5 every year in\nthe third world; let us come together to bring medicine\nfor AIDS to the 25 million Africans who today are\nhopelessly awaiting death; let us come together to\ninvest in development at least a portion of the billions\nalready spent on bombing a country in which almost\nnothing has been left standing.\nCuba demands that the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the United Nations Organization\nas a whole take up once again, as top priorities, the\ndebate of these problems on which depend the lives of\n4.5 billion inhabitants of the third world, whose rights\nand hopes have also been buried under the rubble of\nthe World Trade Center.\nCuba reiterates its categorical condemnation of\nthe terrorist acts committed last 11 September. Cuba\nreiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. Cuba reiterates that it will not\nallow its territory ever to be used for terrorist acts\nagainst the people of the United States or of any other\ncountry.\nCuba has the will to do this because it has\nsuffered terrorist acts for over 40 years; because in\nCuba there are still the relatives of the nearly 3,500\nCubans killed as a result of acts of aggression and\nterrorism; and because justice is still demanded by the\nmore than 2,000 Cubans disabled by acts of aggression\nand terrorism. Some of Cuba\u2019s sons and daughters who\nfought against terrorism have become the victims of\n23\n\ncruel persecutions, merciless treatment and unjust and\nslanderous trials.\nThe people of the United States are victims not\nonly of terrorism and panic but also of the lack of\ntruthful information, manipulation and the questionable\ncurbing of their freedoms. Cuba does not nurture any\nhatred towards the American people, whom we do not\nhold responsible for our suffering caused by terrorism,\nacts of aggression and the unfair economic war that we\nhave had to withstand during almost an entire lifetime.\nWe share with the American people the aspiration of\none day having relations based on respect and\ncooperation.\nIf anyone here takes offence at these words\nuttered on behalf of a small, generous and courageous\npeople, I apologize. We speak in a straightforward\nmanner. Words exist to uphold the truth, not to conceal\nit. We rebel against injustice and oppression. We have\nthe moral resolution. We defend our ideals with our\nlives. Our support can be won for any just cause, but\nwe will not be overcome by force, or allow absurd\nslogans or shameful campaigns to be forced upon us.\nFor many years now, we have proclaimed that for\nus Cubans, the historical dilemma is: \u201cMotherland or\nDeath!\u201d From this comes our confidence and sureness\nthat we are and will continue to be a worthy, sovereign\nand just people.\n\n\n\n\n"

I am confident that, under your\nwise and able leadership, our deliberations will come\nto a fruitful conclusion. The Eritrean delegation assures\nyou of its full cooperation and support.\nMay I also extend to your predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri of Finland, our deep appreciation for the\nskilful and wise manner in which he conducted the\ndeliberations of the fifty-fifth session.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to extend\nheartfelt congratulations, on behalf of the people and\nGovernment of the State of Eritrea, to Mr. Kofi Annan\nupon his well-deserved election for a second term. I am\ncertain that our Organization will benefit immensely\nduring his second term, as it did during his first, from\nhis vision, wisdom, competent leadership and selfless\ndedication. I also wish to congratulate him and the\nUnited Nations on their well-deserved awarding of the\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\nAllow me to express, on behalf of the people and\nGovernment of the State of Eritrea, profound sorrow\nand to extend sincere condolences to the people and\nGovernment of the United States of America in this\ntheir time of grief following the hateful attacks of 11\nSeptember. We also wish to extend our heartfelt\nsympathy and condolences for the victims of the\npainful aeroplane crash of 12 November.\nThe Government of Eritrea condemns the\nbarbaric act committed against innocent civilians by a\nfew craven terrorists. From the outset, we declared\nsolidarity with the people and Government of the\nUnited States against those heinous acts.\nTerrorism violates the most basic of human\nrights: the right to life. Therefore, we must all unite in\nthe protection of all our citizens against these\ndastardly, desperate acts perpetrated by individuals or\norganized terrorist networks. There should be no\nimpunity for such criminals.\nHumankind entered the new millennium with\noptimism and hope \u2014 and for good reason. It had\nrecognized, through bitter experience, the folly of war\nand conflict and the virtue of peace, good-\nneighbourliness and cooperative relations. It had had\nthe opportunity to review past achievements and errors\nand to identify sources of strength and weakness. It had\nevolved lofty norms, values and principles. It had\nestablished refined procedures and created effective\nmechanisms to guarantee their implementation.\nUnfortunately, however, humankind had not yet\nmustered the necessary determination or the collective\nwill to translate that vision into reality. It is evident\nthat it has not yet learned the ways of comprehensive\npeace. The full blooming of a culture of peace and\ndevelopment remains so near and yet so distant.\nConsequently, two years into the new millennium,\nwe continue to witness with dismay immense poverty\nand want in the midst of massive wealth in the world,\ndeprivation in spite of the enormous advances in\nscience and technology, wilful violations of human\n6\n\nrights and manifestations of mutual hatred and\nhostility.\nThe statistics are dismal. Yet, we must not be\nunduly alarmed, if only because it is too early to be\ndiscouraged by unfulfilled and unkept promises. On the\ncontrary, we must decide to confront the challenges,\nincluding the depressing disparity between the rich and\nthe poor, and issues of war and peace and violations of\nhuman rights.\nWe must collectively address the new forces that\nare being unleashed by science and technology,\nincluding globalization. Globalization can serve as an\neffective instrument for establishing an equitable and\njust relationship between the rich and the poor and for\npromoting sustainable development to the mutual\nbenefit of all. However, this can be achieved only if a\ncooperative mechanism is established immediately,\nduring this critically early stage of the twenty-first\ncentury, before we are overtaken by the speed of the\ntechnology and information revolution. It is equally\nimportant that the capacities of the poor nations be\nincreased without delay in order to ensure their\neffective participation in the global economy.\nIt must also be acknowledged that peace, security\nand stability are closely linked to development. It need\nnot be emphasized that there is no development without\npeace, and no peace without security. To this end, all\nefforts must also include development concerns.\nThe world continues to be plagued by wars and\nconflicts that have spilled over from the previous\ncentury, in spite of the international community\u2019s\nefforts and full commitment to peace, security and\nstability.\nThe African continent has perhaps fared the worst\nin the last few years, as it has been beleaguered by\nrepeated economic catastrophes, political disruptions\nand inter-State and intra-State conflicts.\nIt is a source of deep concern to us that\nglobalization has had a severely negative impact on\nAfrican economies. It has deepened their\nmarginalization and kept them from benefiting from\nthe global economy. Africa suffers more than any other\nregion from extreme poverty and, indeed, from\nrecurrent famine. Plagues like malaria, tuberculosis,\nHIV/AIDS, diarrhoea and a host of other debilitating\nand fatal tropical diseases have, in many cases, reached\nbiblical proportions. The decimation of populations has\nhad horrendous consequences on many already weak\neconomies.\nIn addition to economic crises and poverty,\nconflicts, wars and civil strife have prominently\nafflicted Africa during the past decade and a half. In\n1999, close to 20 conflicts were wreaking havoc on the\ncontinent. It was in acknowledgement of the gravity of\nthe matter that the Organization of African Unity\nSummit, held in Algiers in 1999, decided to declare\n2000 as the year for ending conflicts and giving\nmomentum to peace.\nIt was an auspicious year. There were\nencouraging signs in the Sudan, Somalia and the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and a\ncomprehensive peace agreement was signed between\nEritrea and Ethiopia. Yet much remains to be done. It is\nencouraging to note that Africans are making great and\nsustained efforts to resolve the conflicts in Sierra\nLeone, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, the Great Lakes region,\nSomalia and the Sudan at the regional level.\nIn the same vein, a just and durable solution to\nthe problem in the Middle East must be found through\nthe creation of a fully independent Palestinian State.\nThe international community must be involved\nmore meaningfully in assisting the peoples of these\ncountries. Yet, the primary responsibility for resolving\nconflict, achieving national reconciliation and\nestablishing peace, security and stability lies with the\npeoples and leaders of these countries. It must also be\nemphasized that, while any regional assistance\nrendered is to be appreciated, it must be predicated\nupon the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the\nassisted countries. Such assistance should be based on\nlofty principles and aimed at serving the interests and\nwell-being of the countries in question.\nThe Horn of Africa has been a zone of conflict\nfor the past four decades. Peace, security, stability and\ndevelopment are the collective responsibility of the\nStates of the region. It behoves them to earnestly\npromote, protect and consolidate cooperative relations\non the basis of mutual respect for each other\u2019s\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, renunciation\nof the threat or use of force, peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, good-neighbourly relations and peaceful\ncoexistence.\nSince its independence in 1993, the State of\nEritrea has espoused national security and development\n7\n\npolicies and programmes based on the premise that our\nsecurity and development interests are closely linked to\nregional security and prosperity. To this end, it actively\nengaged itself in the revitalization of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nand the propagation of IGAD\u2019s new mission. IGAD is\nnow fully engaged in peacemaking and conflict\nresolution and coordinating cooperative efforts among\nits member States. In this context, my delegation\nwishes to extend special thanks to President Daniel\narap Moi of Kenya and President Ismail Omar Guelleh\nof Djibouti for their dedicated, unbiased and untiring\nefforts to bring peace to the Sudan and Somalia\nrespectively.\nThe search for durable peace, security and\nstability must be the collective commitment of all\nmember States of IGAD and it must be anchored solely\nin the welfare and best interests of the peoples\nconcerned. Peace in Somalia is vital, and it should not\nbe held hostage by any Government under the pretext\nof preserving its national security. History and the\nSomali people will make them responsible if they\nbecome an obstacle or try to hinder peacemaking\nefforts in the region.\nThe world welcomed the signing of the\nAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities, a\ncomprehensive peace Agreement between Eritrea and\nEthiopia. It has expressed the hope that the\nimplementation of the Agreement will proceed\nsmoothly and will lead to a durable peace.\nBoth countries owe it to their people and to the\nentire international community to establish a durable\npeace as soon as possible. We face the challenge of\nmeeting the hopes and great expectations of our people\nand of the international community. Eritrea solemnly\nreiterates not only its abiding commitment to the peace\nAgreement and its speedy implementation, but also its\nundertaking to fully cooperate with all its partners in\nthe peace process.\nThe peace process has made significant progress.\nHowever, I should like to inform the Assembly that key\nprovisions of the peace Agreement remain\nunimplemented because the Government of Ethiopia\nhas failed to comply with its obligations. It has, to date,\nobstructed the establishment of the temporary security\nzone and the establishment of a direct air route\nbetween the capitals of the two countries. Moreover, it\nhas refused to submit operationally useful information\non its minefields in the temporary security zone and to\nrelease civilian detainees and war prisoners.\nIt has also resumed the deportation of Eritreans\nand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, in blatant violation\nof the comprehensive peace Agreement between the\ntwo countries. The last round of deportation occurred\non 25 June 2001 and was strongly condemned by the\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea\n(UNMEE) and the International Committee of the Red\nCross.\nUnder these circumstances, it is surprising that\nEthiopia has recently accused Eritrea of placing its\narmy on high alert and of deploying its troops along the\ncommon border. This baseless accusation, refuted by\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative in\nEritrea and Ethiopia, is designed to hide Ethiopia\u2019s\nplans and intentions to sabotage the peace process by\nprovoking hostilities.\nThe Government of Eritrea has consistently\nundertaken, in good faith, to comply fully with the\nprovisions of the Algiers Agreement, in spite of the\nintransigence of the Government of Ethiopia and its\nviolation of it.\nThe Government of Eritrea wishes to extend\nsincere appreciation to, and applauds the effort of, the\npeace partners, particularly the United Nations, the\nEuropean Union, the Organization of African Unity\nand the Governments of the United States and Algeria.\nIt also extends its profound thanks to the friends of\nUNMEE for their immense contribution to the peace\nprocess. At the same time, it urges the international\ncommunity to exert extra effort to persuade the\nEthiopian Government to fulfil its legal obligations\nunder the Algiers peace Agreement and the United\nNations Charter without delay.\nEritrea has always been consistent in its\ncondemnation of terrorism, irrespective of the\nperpetrators or victims. It has itself become the victim\nof terrorist attacks by elements organized, financed,\ntrained and armed by the Ethiopian Government. These\nterrorists are often joined by Ethiopian troops and\nmilitias in their heinous crimes against innocent\ncivilians. We urge the international community to\ncondemn these barbarous acts and to demand that the\nEthiopian Government cease its activities and hostile\nacts as soon as possible.\n8\n\nIn conclusion, despite its regrettable experience\nwith the United Nations in the early days, Eritrea is\nfully convinced that the Organization has played a\ncrucial role in the maintenance of international peace\nand security and has contributed immensely to the\npromotion and protection of human rights, as well as to\neconomic development and social progress.\nEritrea is fully and unequivocally committed to\nstrengthening the United Nations. To this end, we\nbelieve that the United Nations must proceed with a\nprocess of change and reform that will reinforce the\nprinciple of equality among all its Members and\nguarantee its impartiality and neutrality. Hence, we\nfully endorse the position of the Non-Aligned\nMovement on membership of the Security Council and\nthe question of a periodic review of its structure and\nfunctions. We are confident that much will be achieved\nunder the visionary leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan\nduring his second term of office.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would really like\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I\nknow that you bring with you a wealth of experience, a\nbreadth of understanding and hope for many people. I\nwould also like to express my highest regard for\n9\n\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on his well-deserved\nrecognition as Nobel Prize Laureate for his fresh ideas\nand great vision on how to meet a new world with an\nopen mind, a sense of unity and hope.\nThere is hidden light and needed hope in this\ngathering to overturn the darkness that has descended\nupon us. There is enough strength and resolve in the\nmidst of civilized nations to deflect evil.\nHumanity woke up happy to welcome the twenty-\nfirst century. We turned around and looked, and there\nwas brightness and freshness in the air. We had\ndeparted from a traditional history that was written\nwith red ink \u2014 wars, skirmishes, conflicts and\nmurders \u2014 many of which arose because human\nexistence was dependent upon land and natural\nresources. We have had to protect our own lands.\nModern science emerged to supersede land,\nopening new horizons of limitless opportunities.\nScience rendered borders marginal, and old prejudices\nand distances began to dissipate from our minds.\nTechnology created a new interdependence. No longer\nwere our connections dependent upon land or sea \u2014\nupon distance. Air became the new means of\ncommunication for nations, peoples, businesses and\ndevelopment. High technology introduced new\npromises and recalled the importance of old values.\nThe perception was that every person,\nirrespective of location, race, religion or sex, could\nreach new heights. And then we learned that high\ntechnology is not just a technical matter. We cannot\nseparate technology from values; it is impossible.\nFor example, you cannot combine lies and\nscience. You cannot lie scientifically. To have a\nscience-based economy, you have to pursue peace\nuncompromisingly and openness uninterruptedly.\nScience requires an open society; it demands constant\ndialogue. You cannot have new innovations without\nunrestricted research. You cannot have unrestricted\nresearch without being a free society. You cannot\ndevelop a scientific economy without making\neducation a top priority, available and accessible to all\npeople. You cannot attract investment unless you have\ntransparency.\nIn a competitive world, to keep young scientists\nyour land and water should be free from pollution, your\nfinancial system free from corruption, your government\nwithout arbitrariness. Truth, freedom and openness\nbecame conditions for science and high technology\nand, consequently, for the advancement of any society.\nIt is true that the world is still divided between\nthe haves and the have nots. But for the have nots, a\nnew option is that of becoming connected to the new\nage and the more developed aspects of our times.\nThere had been a new beginning, but like many\nbeginnings, one mixed with shadows and revolt. The\nshadows were not yet heavy; at the beginning they\nlooked pale and distant. So we felt like one promised\nworld, like one assembly. The economy was no longer\nnational; it became global \u2014 open to every nation. And\nsince we could not form a global government, the\nnational Governments agreed that the global economy\nwould be managed by private enterprises \u2014 hence,\nprivatization. Globalization decreased the importance\nof traditional States and increased the importance of\nnon-governmental organizations and worldwide\nconnections. It looked as if borderless progress was\nevolving. And then ambushing clouds, global in nature,\nmoved in as a new horror.\nThe horrific events of 11 September \u2014 the\nsavage attack on innocent American people \u2014\nsignalled a new warning to world history. On 11\nSeptember, we learned that the very same technology I\nmentioned earlier \u2014 openness and a frontier-less,\nconnected world \u2014 could also spread viciousness. This\nattack was brutal, because it was directed at everything\nwe stand for, against everything for which nations, and\nthe United Nations, have toiled.\nThe emerging terror, like the emerging economy,\nis no longer national or delineated by boundaries.\nRather, it is borderless, and it contains unlimited,\nawesome potential. It can begin with knives, and it may\nwind up with germs. Terror does not have a visible\naddress, a merciful lord in heaven, a court or an elected\ngovernment. Nor does it need the approval of the many.\nIt is built on the fanaticism of a small group of\nmurderers, lacking the checks and balances of an\naccountable society. It may arrive unexpectedly,\nuninvited, spreading fear in every corner of the globe,\nparalysing us at work and home, grounding flights,\nimpeding movement, disrupting commerce and\nproduction. Eventually, it can endanger the freshness of\nair, the purity of water.\nGlobal economy arrived as an historic surprise;\nglobal terrorism also arrived without prior warning.\nBut, whereas a solution was found to regulate the\n10\n\nglobal economy, through privatization, there is no\nprivate answer to meet global terrorism. Many nations\nhave armies, without necessarily having enemies. Yet,\nfor the time being, global dangers remain without\nglobal answers or global armies.\nThe United States played the pivotal role in\nintroducing the new economy. Now again, it falls upon\nthe United States, as the first target of global terrorism,\nto offer a strategy, to take the lead and to bring back\nthe promise of freedom and security to many of us.\nWe pay tribute to the United States, a nation that\nhad the capacity to welcome new modes of creativity,\nplanning, production and innovation at home and\nabroad. And while becoming mighty, it did not stop\ncaring for the rest of the world. The United States has\nhelped nations in Europe and Asia and elsewhere\nregain freedom and security in times of danger.\nAmerican boys fought, and many of them lost\ntheir lives, in European and Asian wars. They won\nwars and gained land, but they did not keep those\nassets for themselves. They returned to Japan an\nimproved Japan. They returned to Germany an\nimproved Germany. The Marshall Plan helped to\nrebuild Europe. Needy countries were offered food and\nassistance, industries were restored, economies were\nrehabilitated. There was generosity in their victory.\nIndeed, America has emerged as the \u201cindispensable\nnation\u201d.\nNow America has become a target for reasons\nwhich are not necessarily its own. Terrorism was\ndirected at America to frustrate its democracy, weaken\nits respect for human rights, reduce its enterprise and\nthreaten its individualism so that it would not be able\nto help others. This was an assault on the very\nexistence of humanity.\nThe bin Laden group are afraid of progress. They\nare proponents of backwardness. They want us to\nreturn to living in caves. They represent the darkest\nages in the annals of human history. They are self-\nappointed killers of any persons who think differently\nfrom them. They are not just evil \u2014 they are an agency\nof death.\nAmerica is not just a new world or continent \u2014 it\nis a great constitution, a shining city on the hill of\nfreedom. It is not just a concrete structure \u2014 it is a\nsolid idea. You can attack America, hurt it, but\nAmerica cannot be destroyed.\nAmerica\u2019s war on terrorism is the war of all of us.\nBy \u201cus\u201d, I mean every country in this Assembly and\nevery human being on this planet. Bin Laden claims\nthat he fights crusaders, who no longer exist. Bin\nLaden claims that he wants to help the Palestinians, but\nin the eyes of the Palestinians, he is an obstacle, not an\naid.\nIsrael made peace with Egypt and returned all the\nland and water without bin Ladens, without terror. We\ndid likewise with the Jordanians \u2014 not because of\nterror, but because terror came to an end. At Camp\nDavid in July 2000, we offered the Palestinians\npractically all the land without bin Ladens, without\nterror. And if there remained a difference of 1 or 2 per\ncent, that does not justify the killing of thousands of\nmen and women in America. Political differences do\nnot justify murdering even a single child, no matter of\nwhich nation.\nBin Laden and his abhorrent ideas can never\ncontribute to peace. They offer no solution and no hope\nto any nation, religion or person. They spread hatred,\ndisseminate fear and plant mines. They are a\ncatastrophe at large.\nThe new world economy enabled two of the most\npopulous countries \u2014 China and India \u2014 to move\nforward and offer new life and opportunity to hundreds\nof millions of people. It has changed the face of\nEurope. It has reversed the fortunes of Latin America.\nIt has extended an open invitation to every country to\nacquire computers, widen education, open its gates and\njoin a new age without giving up its old values and\ntraditions. The new world economy called for an\nassembly of responsible nations to build a dam against\nterror, knowing perfectly well that the fight against\nterror cannot be postponed, cannot be forgiven, cannot\nbe compromised. It is a matter of life and death for\nhumanity in the new chapter of our existence.\nAll of us, nations and individuals, will either\ncontribute to safety and freedom or become targets of\ndeath and backwardness. Every country must choose its\nplace in the new world, either in the realm of science\nand technology or in the wastebasket of the old land\neconomy, dependent on the whims of nature,\ncondemned to the poverty of hopelessness. It is the\nresponsibility of affluent nations to share the wealth of\nknowledge so that others can join them. Rich countries\nshould become a locomotive for the deprived, not a\nluxury liner for the privileged.\n11\n\nWe pray wholeheartedly from the great and united\ncity of Jerusalem, as we did in the early days of our\nexistence, that we shall know again how to distinguish\nbetween good and evil, between tohu va\u2019vo-hu \u2014\nchaos \u2014 and a new tomorrow. Our region gave birth to\nthe greatest prophets, their moral dictums setting the\nmoral fabric of our society. They have guided us to\ntrust and follow reason and realism. But we were\nforced to follow funerals more than reason. This has\nexacted a heavy price from Jews, Muslims, Christians,\nDruze. It is time that we rediscovered the Ten\nCommandments, holy to all of us.\nRight now it looks as if we are again sinking into\nthe past. The emotional conflict is greater than the\nterritorial gap. It is more difficult to muster the strength\nand summon the spirit than to divide the land. In spite\nof these difficulties, I daresay there is a hidden\nopportunity in the vast divide. I feel strongly that while\nwe cannot recover lost time, we can introduce a new\nvista in the Middle East.\nUntil now, the world related to the Middle East.\nNow the Middle East has to relate to the new world.\nOur neighbours \u2014 Palestinians and Arabs \u2014 know that\nIsrael is committed to contribute whatever it can to\nrenew a real peace process \u2014 not by force, not by\nimposition, not by unilateral action, but through a\nnegotiated agreement, an agreed peace. There is no\npeace but an agreed peace. Just as one cannot applaud\nwith one hand, there cannot be a one-handed peace.\nProblems, naturally, have a date of birth.\nSolutions must reach their maturity. It may not happen\nat once, but it will happen. Yesterday, you would\nhardly find, for example, support for a Palestinian State\nand, although this is not yet a formal policy of the\nGovernment of Israel, there is now support for\nPalestinian independence and for a Palestinian State.\nWe do not want to dominate the Palestinians; we want\nthem to breathe freedom, to create a new economy, to\nmaintain their traditions, to enjoy the highest level of\neducation and to provide real security to all parties.\nAs far as Israel is concerned, we are convinced\nthat good neighbours are better than good guns. In\nmodern times, you cannot have real security dependent\nonly on fences, walls, fortifications or trenches; not\neven on tanks and guns and missiles. All these\nmeasures have already become anti-measures, making\nthem incomplete and temporary. The only strategy that\ncannot be ignored is neighbourly relations, such as the\ncommon market in Europe, the Rio Group in Latin\nAmerica, the North American Free Trade Agreement in\nNorth America, the Association of South-East Asian\nNations in Asia and the New Partnership for African\nDevelopment in Africa. All these frameworks have\nshown that answers to old historical, military and\npolitical conflicts may reside in the economic domain.\nWhat endangers the new solution is terror. Terror\nis again endangering the world. The division is no\nlonger between East and West, North and South, but\nbetween the union to stop terror and those who refuse\nto recognize its menace. The assembly against terror\ncomprises most of humanity: the United States,\nEurope, China, Russia, India, South America, many\ncountries in Africa and many countries in the Muslim\nworld.\nDemocracies must have a non-democratic\ninstitution to defend themselves. Armies are non-\ndemocratic, but without them democracy would not\nprevail. You may have many views in a democratic\nsociety, but only one authority that controls the military\nand its arms. Armies must be subordinate to the elected\npolitical body, but if you have one political authority\nand several armed groups, you can have neither\ndemocracy nor security.\nThe Palestinian Authority, which is a State in\nbeing, must establish one authority over all arms, all\narmies and all use of arms, not for the sake of Israel,\nbut for the sake of peace and for the sake of its own\ndestiny, so that bullets will not negate ballots.\nAs long as terror persists, Israel has no choice but\nto defend its people. The word \u201cterror\u201d does not\ndescribe an abstract dilemma for us. It refers to a\nreality of between 30 to 40 violent incidents every\nday \u2014 shootings, bombings, ambushes and killings. It\nis perpetrated by suicide bombers who have no respect\nfor life, either their own or that of others. The only\nplace they can be intercepted is at the point from which\nthey depart.\nIsrael is, by definition, an experienced member of\nthe anti-terror camp. We know that terror can never win\nif people protect and preserve their fundamental\nsecurity. Terror is strong as long as anti-terror is weak\nand terror is frightening as long as people are afraid of\nit. Terror basically represents cowardliness and does\nnot serve any real purpose. Terror neither follows\njustice nor serves goals. It is not a remedy; it is a\nmalady.\n12\n\nWe are at a juncture. The world is pursuing new\nopportunities and frontiers. No longer will it be a world\ndivided between developed and underdeveloped\nnations, black and white or men and women. It will\nbecome a world where every person will have access to\nknowledge and opportunity to participate in the new\ngenesis. States have become weaker economically and\nstrategically because economy and strategy have\nthemselves become global. Yet we do not have\norganized world institutions to secure the globe and\ndistribute wealth more justly.\nTwo courses are open to every State: either to\njoin the new economy or to submit to old terror; the\ncreation of wealth or the threat of death. Each must\nmake its own choice between the promise of economy\nor protest by terror. The Global Compact initiated by\nthe Secretary-General offers us a road map to the\nformer. It defines the functions and contributions of the\nUnited Nations and imposes responsibilities on all of\nus \u2014 nation States, the private sector and civil society.\nIt provides us with hope that, even as crises exist,\nobscuring the opportunities just visible from the corner\nof our eyes, the path to progress is clear to all with the\ncourage to embrace it.\nWe woke up to the twenty-first century with such\noptimism. We must overcome the dangers so that our\nchildren will again be raised in a world of almost\nlimitless opportunities. It can be done. We have learned\nin Jerusalem that we can make a promised land into a\nland of promise for all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me\ngreat pleasure to convey to Mr. Han Seung-soo\nheartfelt congratulations, on behalf of my delegation\nand the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis, on his\naccession to the honourable post of President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor\non a job well done, especially during such an\nexhausting period for the United Nations. The success\nof the United Nations is built on the hard work of its\nMembers, and both the President and his predecessor\nhave shown dedication to the positive functioning of\nthis esteemed institution.\nIn the last decade, world leaders have been\nworking tirelessly in different forums to redefine and\naddress the myriad challenges that characterize the so-\ncalled new order. This has placed a great premium on\nthe United Nations, which has provided an able\nplatform for exchanges of ideas, practical dialogue and\nconflict resolution. My delegation is satisfied that\nmarked progress has been made in identifying many of\nthe critical issues. The United Nations deserves high\npraise, and we commend Member States for their\nwillingness to use the diplomatic and political\nresources of the Organization in the conduct of their\ninternational relations.\nThe involvement of the United Nations in recent\ntimes is a fitting backdrop for the decision that the\ncoming year will be designated the Year of Dialogue\namong Civilizations. This is most timely, and it serves\nas a revalidation of our belief that dialogue is a critical\ningredient in promoting partnership and improved\nunderstanding among Governments and peoples.\nDialogue is the foundation of solid democracies,\nstrong people-centred institutions, civil societies and\nsustainable human development. Dialogue is still that\nvery important catalyst which often staves off war and\nconflict, enabling consensus and confidence-building\nin an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. Thus, it is\nquite obvious why the Government of Saint Kitts and\nNevis supports this idea.\nIn a certain sense, a new world order dawned on\n11 September 2001, when terrorism, in a most\noutrageous form, reared its ugly head in the cities of\nWashington and New York, in the United States of\nAmerica, with the loss of thousands of innocent lives.\nDialogue among members of the international\ncommunity rapidly spawned an anti-terrorism coalition\nof countries, thereby defining the protagonists in this\nunfolding new order. My country stands solidly with\nthis coalition, especially in pursuing the generally\nagreed strategies to contain terrorism. Despite the\nhorrendous act of 11 September and subsequent\nbioterrorism, life goes on, adjusted to a new reality.\nAnother opportunity where dialogue may prove\nuseful in advancing human security will come when\nGovernments meet at the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico next\nyear. Saint Kitts and Nevis regards this as an important\noccasion to promote the interests of all nations. But, we\nare especially hopeful that this Conference will\nembrace the aspirations and promote better\nappreciation for the needs, vulnerabilities and special\ncircumstances of small economies in small island\ndeveloping States.\n23\n\nMy Prime Minister has repeatedly urged the\ninternational community to take a more unbiased look\nat the peculiar situation of small, vulnerable\neconomies. This is not an appeal for international\ncharity, but a signal to promote the kind of realism\nthrough which a Marshall Plan of commitment can be\ndevised to energize small, vulnerable economies so that\nthey can effectively participate in a globalized\neconomy.\nDialogue is important in building real\nparticipatory democracies. But democracy among\nnations is as crucial as democracy within nations.\nWhen the people we serve feel that our actions as\nleaders do not reflect their dreams, goals and\naspirations, they may use their democratic right to\neffect change. We have a duty, therefore, to give loud\nvoices to their silent legitimate hopes. We must place\nadded value on the hopes and expectations of our\npeople in order to legitimize the concepts of\nrepresentative democracy.\nIt is within this context that I urge this body to\nredouble its efforts in finding a solution to the\nunfortunate stalemate that beleaguers relations between\nthe Chinese people across the Taiwan Straits. My\nGovernment remains convinced that both sides of the\nTaiwan Straits should become fully engaged in this\npeaceful and non-coercive process without the\ndistraction of preconditions. It would lead to the\nsuccessful resolution of what appears to be a very\ncontentious issue. At the same time, we encourage the\nUnited Nations to be vigilant and ready to assist where\npossible or when required. Prior to the peaceful\nsettlement of their dispute, it is imperative that we\nestablish a mechanism by which the international\ncommunity can benefit more appropriately from the\nproven expertise, technical know-how and skills of the\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nWe call on the United Nations to assist in the\nresolution of the question of full inclusion of Cuba into\nthe affairs of the western hemisphere. Also, we urge\nthe people of Cuba, as we celebrate the Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations, to embrace the\nchallenge of ensuring that they can participate fully in\nthe community of nations.\nParticipatory democracy among nations must be\nerected on the twin pillars of mutual respect and trust.\nBut trust wanes in the face of unilateral actions such as\nthreats made by the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries to\nblacklist and impose sanctions on sovereign Caribbean\nGovernments, consequent upon the OECD countries\u2019\nmisunderstanding of fiscal initiatives taken by\nsovereign Caribbean Governments as a way to\nunderpin sustainable economic development.\nAs we celebrate the Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations, we urge Member States to resist the lure\nof national paternalism and unilateral action as a means\nof problem-solving. In a matter so crucial to the\neconomic future of Caribbean countries, it is\ninconceivable that conclusions could have been\nreached and decisions arrived at without the courtesy\nof dialogue with the very countries against whom such\nscathing indictments had been made. However, most\nrecently, wiser counsel has prevailed and, in a spirit of\ndialogue and partnership, significant progress has been\nmade by means of a compromise agreement. The\nCaribbean Community hails this agreement on offshore\nfiscal initiatives as a step in the right direction. Such is\nthe power of dialogue among civilizations.\nWe imagine that the mechanisms of globalization,\nif timely and equitably applied, can be productive,\ninclusive, and improve lives. It must be emphasized\nthat, although small States may justifiably harbour\nsome apprehension about globalization, we do not\noppose it. On the contrary, we welcome the\nopportunities to empower our citizens so that they may\ncompete successfully in a global marketplace, mindful\nthat empowerment and the ability to compete\nsuccessfully, however, require appropriate skill-sets,\nacademic resources and material tools. In order for\nsmall States to benefit fully from the new economic\norder, the global agenda must become a humane\nagenda, sufficiently responsive to facilitate equitable\nand affordable access to modern technology \u2014 that is\nto say, technology that is appropriate and responsive to\nthe basic needs of poor communities and small States.\nWithout realism and a holistic approach in\nexamining the social and economic conditions within\nsmall States, there is a potential for serious dislocation\nwhen these States attempt to operate within the global\nmarketplace. As responsible Member States, we have a\ngenuine obligation to work towards improving the lives\nof the disenfranchised. This, I am sure, is the main\nreason we are here today. Therefore, we must continue\nto right this important chapter in the development of\nhuman security. We must also remain cognizant that, as\nmembers of the global village, we have to discard old\n24\n\nsuspicions and embrace new partnerships, dialogue and\ndiversity as necessary components of our\ninterdependence.\nPartnership and understanding will prove\nessential in our efforts to tackle common problems\nsuch as drug trafficking and the pandemic of\nHIV/AIDS. The special session on HIV/AIDS came at\nan important juncture, and we urge Member States to\nsupport the decisions that were taken. In small States,\nlike Saint Kitts and Nevis, the pandemic of HIV/AIDS\npresents one of the most devastating challenges to the\ndevelopment of human security, because such a disease\nthreatens to unravel the delicately woven balance of\nsocial growth and economic potential.\nOur people are at great risk, and the prospect of\nlosing decades of development and talented people to\nthis illness is amazingly real. On top of losing their\nyoung and most productive people, Governments are\nexpected in turn to reallocate significant amounts of\nalready meagre resources from critical development\nprograms to provide costly care and treatment. We\nsalute the United States Government, the World Bank,\nand others for their recent and important initiatives to\nhelp fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the Caribbean\nand we urge others to adopt similar initiatives.\nWe see what an important role dialogue is playing\nin the hemispheric approach at the Organization of\nAmerican States (OAS) through the Multilateral\nEvaluation Mechanism. This allows member\nGovernments to collaborate in the fight against drug\ntrafficking, in supply and demand initiatives and in the\nimplementation of national or shared strategies. We\nbelieve this approach is useful, because it makes\ncommon approaches more frequent, discourages\nunilateral actions and allows member States to share\nexperiences on interdiction, the epidemiology of drug\nabuse and other trends. The fight against drug\ntrafficking, you will agree, is a transnational one. We\ncannot point fingers or apportion blame. We need to\ntake action.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the approach of\nthe OAS, which permits us in the Caribbean to work in\na multilateral framework to find common solutions.\nEqually, such a mechanism focuses attention on the\nroot problems and encourages hemispheric partnership.\nWe hope that these kinds of approaches will become\nintegral components of problem solving at the United\nNations.\nIn closing, the past year was particularly eventful.\nWe began with the Millennium Summit and concluded\nwith the HIV/AIDS special session. In between, we\ninteracted on many contentious issues. It is my hope\nthat during the new year we can move forward with\nrenewed vigour, building on the hard work that our\npredecessors left in our charge, and paving the way for\na brighter future for those to whom we will pass the\nbaton. Once again, we salute the President on behalf of\nthe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to\nextend to Mr. Han Seung-soo greetings from the\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of\nVanuatu. I wish to convey to him the apologies of my\nGovernment for not being able to be represented here\nat the ministerial level owing to the fact that our\nParliament is currently in session. I should also like to\ntake this opportunity to convey my Government\u2019s\ncongratulations to him on his election as President of\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also\npay tribute to his predecessor, who so ably played a\ndecisive role at the helm of the fifty-fifth session.\nIn addition, allow me to congratulate the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to a\nsecond term at the head of this esteemed world body.\nHis assured wisdom and compassion are needed now\nmore than ever to lead this Organization.\nI have the great honour, in standing before the\nAssembly today, to deliver a statement on behalf of my\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Vanuatu\nat a time so sad that words cannot begin to convey the\nscope of our emotions. Let me express the sincere\nsympathy and condolences of my Government and the\npeople of Vanuatu to the families and friends of the\nvictims of the tragedy that struck downtown New York,\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. In light of these\nevents, since the 11 September attacks, the General\nAssembly has been forced to suspend most of its\n35\n\nagenda, including this general debate among heads of\nState and Government.\nIt is ironic that as the world becomes more\ncivilized, we become more vulnerable to such inhuman\nacts of terrorism. The impacts of these terrorist\nactivities are being felt around the globe, and small\nStates such as mine will suffer along with the rest of\nthe international community. If any good has come out\nof the despicable events of 11 September, it is that\nnations the world over are more united than ever in\ncondemning and collaborating to eradicate these\nterrible acts of terrorism. My Government has taken\nsteps to tighten security and is working closely with\nother Pacific island States towards building and\nstrengthening peace and security in our region.\nGlobal peace and security cannot be certain in\nthis climate of continued difference of views between\nmajor nuclear-weapon States. The lack of progress on\nthis is reflected by the stalemate prevailing in the\nConference on Disarmament. The agreements reached\nduring the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons were not realized; the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into force; and\nglobal military expenditures continue to rise. More\ncommitted efforts and innovative strategies are needed\nto meet the goals of the Millennium Declaration.\nVanuatu believes that the Conference on Disarmament\nshould work towards that end.\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the\nLeast Developed Countries, held in Brussels in May\nthis year, was highly successful and produced the\nBrussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.\nWe appreciate the view of the Secretary-General that\nthe Declaration reaffirms the collective responsibility\nof the international community to uphold the principles\nof human dignity, equality and equity and to ensure\nthat globalization becomes a positive force for all the\nworld\u2019s people. We believe that without the\ncoordinated involvement of the whole United Nations\nsystem, there will be little the United Nations can\nachieve.\nThe Government of Vanuatu, like other\nGovernments around the world, is committed to\nenhancing the status of women. It is well documented\nthat women in Vanuatu are disadvantaged in almost all\nsectors. In 1995, Vanuatu unanimously ratified the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women. Accordingly, the\nGovernment of Vanuatu is focusing on the Convention\nas the basis for programmes on women\u2019s rights and\ndevelopment in Vanuatu.\nA lack of resources has hindered Vanuatu\u2019s\nprogress in submitting its first two reports. The\nGovernment, however, recognizes the importance of\nthe reports in terms of building up and monitoring its\nown human resources development requirements and is\nthus putting greater effort into the production of these\nreports. Indeed, no country can afford to waste half of\nits human resources.\nVanuatu remains steadfast in its commitments and\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. Since ratifying the Convention in 1992, the\nGovernment of Vanuatu has implemented decisions and\nundertaken activities that promote the advancement of\nchildren in our society. A National Children\u2019s\nCommittee, whose membership is made up of\nstakeholders, has been revived and is officially\nrecognized as the regulatory body for coordinating and\nsupervising children\u2019s rights throughout the nation.\nThe electoral assistance provided by the United\nNations for Fiji\u2019s national election has greatly\nfacilitated the democratic transition in that country. We\nwelcome the new focus on supporting institutions and\nstimulating local participation. We also welcome other\nefforts to deploy the Electoral Assistance Division to\ncoordinate the activities of foreign observers in\nforthcoming elections, particularly in East Timor and\nhopefully in Solomon Islands. We commend the United\nNations for its assistance in empowering the citizens of\nMember States to enjoy the power of democracy.\nWe recognize the efforts of the United Nations in\nbridging the gap between human rights norms and their\nimplementation. Despite some progress, challenges\nremain in ensuring universal respect for human rights.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu is a party to nearly all core\nhuman rights treaties. We feel there is a continuing\nneed for human and institutional capacity-building in\ndeveloping countries in order to ensure the\nimplementation of human rights conventions and\ntreaties they have signed. This is an area where the\nUnited Nations should follow a needs-based approach\nand make a realistic assessment of the existing\nmechanisms.\n36\n\nThe East Timorese people, who have already\nelected their Constituent Assembly, will democratically\nelect their President and soon exercise full sovereignty\nover their entire territory; this positive development is\na big leap. It affirms the outstanding commitment of\nthe Committee of 24 in deliberating on the right of\npeoples to self-determination. However, there are those\nwho are still waiting to exercise this right. At this\nsession\u2019s general debate, I am pleased to note that the\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\nOrganization gives special mention to West Papua. The\nSecretary-General intends to enhance our efforts to\nassist Indonesia in seeking to establish a democratic\nsociety and in addressing the wide range of complex\nissues facing that country. The Secretary-General also\nunderlined the efforts of the Indonesian authorities to\nfurther the promotion of human rights and find\npeaceful resolutions to the problems in West Papua,\nAceh and Maluku. During the thirty-second Pacific\nIslands Forum in Nauru, Forum leaders expressed\ncontinuing concern about violence and loss of life in\nthe Indonesian province of West Papua. The Forum\nalso called on the Indonesian authorities to ensure to\nthat the voices of all parties in West Papua be heard in\norder to achieve a peaceful resolution. Our leaders\nwelcomed the recent presentation of special autonomy\nproposals to Indonesia\u2019s national assembly, while\nurging all parties to protect and uphold the human\nrights of all residents in West Papua.\nI am extremely pleased to inform the Assembly\nthat the Government of Vanuatu has agreed to host the\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization seminar in\nPort Vila, Vanuatu, in May of next year. We look\nforward to that important meeting.\nThe Republic of Vanuatu wishes to join others in\nexpressing our appreciation to the Secretary-General\nfor his comprehensive report on the implementation of\nthe recommendations of the Special Committee on\nPeacekeeping Operations and of the Panel on United\nNations Peace Operations. Vanuatu is a new supporter\nof the United Nations peacekeeping role in East Timor\nand Bosnia and has contributed civilian police to these\nUnited Nations peacekeeping initiatives. The Vanuatu\nGovernment remains committed to future peacekeeping\nengagements. Vanuatu has also monitored the\nBougainville peace process alongside the United\nNations.\nOne of the more pressing issues before us is that\nof climate change and sea-level rise. The United\nNations has now scheduled a World Summit on\nSustainable Development, to be held in Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa, in September of next year.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum communiqu\u00e9 reflected\non climate change in seeking the international\ncommunity\u2019s awareness of our low-lying islands in the\nPacific and reiterating the priority of the Kyoto\nProtocol as a significant step forward for global action\nin combating climate change. Although signed by\nmany of the industrialized countries, including the\nUnited States, the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been\nratified by many of them. We are very concerned that\nthe United States Senate has actually voted against\nratification.\nOur Forum leaders noted the concerns expressed\nby most members over the United States intention not\nto ratify the Kyoto Protocol. We urge the United States\nto reconsider its position and to ratify the Kyoto\nProtocol as soon as possible.\nWhile the incidence of HIV/AIDS is not as high\nin the Pacific as in some other regions, it is\nnevertheless a major issue for both developing and\ndeveloped countries within our region. Vanuatu\u2019s\ndelegation is of the firm view that prevention should be\nthe mainstay of combating HIV/AIDS in our region.\nThe relatively low number of reported HIV/AIDS\ncases in a number of our countries should not give rise\nto complacency. Once the disease takes hold, care and\ntreatment can be extremely expensive. In this respect,\nVanuatu welcomes the establishment of a Global Fund\nto combat HIV/AIDS, and we wish to express our\nappreciation to those Governments, foundations and\nprivate companies that have already expressed support.\nMeanwhile, strategies and plans for resource\nmobilization must keep in mind the competing\npriorities of, and the constraints faced by, smaller\nStates like Vanuatu.\nIn conclusion, the Vanuatu delegation reaffirms\nits support and conviction for the crucial role that the\nUnited Nations has in ensuring that the world becomes\na much safer place in which to live.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore all else, on behalf of the Government and\npeople of the Republic of Korea, I wish to convey our\ndeepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved\nfamilies and friends of those who lost lives in the\nhorrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September. This\nunprecedented criminal act has posed a grave threat to\ninternational peace and security, as well as a serious\nchallenge to human dignity. Such terrorist acts\nconstitute a crime against humanity and civilization\nthat cannot be justified by any cause.\nTo forestall the recurrence of such incidents and\nto eradicate international terrorism, comprehensive and\ncommon efforts at the international level are urgently\nneeded. The United Nations is expected to play an\nimportant role in these efforts. Immediately after the\nterrorist attacks in September, the Security Council and\nthe General Assembly adopted resolutions denouncing\nterrorism and calling for measures for its elimination.\nThis prompt action, as well as the ensuing debates at\nthe United Nations, attest to the major role to be played\nby the Organization in the anti-terrorism effort.\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will\ncontinue to actively take part in the measures taken by\nthe United Nations, including the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), and will join\nthe effort to free the international community from the\nscourge of terrorism. At the same time, we will spare\nno effort in rendering humanitarian assistance to the\nrefugees who have been displaced as a result of the war\nagainst terrorism.\nFurthermore, in preparing to co-host the 2002\nKorea/Japan FIFA World Cup, we will do our utmost to\nensure that the event is held in a secure atmosphere\nfree from the threat of terrorism.\nI stand here with much reminiscence. The\nRepublic of Korea, once one of the major recipients of\nUnited Nations assistance, is now an active contributor\nto the effort to realize the ideals and goals of this body.\nIt is also the country whose Minister for Foreign\nAffairs had the honour of presiding over the first\nsession of the General Assembly in the new century.\nThe birth of the Republic and its development\nthereafter owe a great deal to United Nations\n34\n\nassistance. Indeed, the Government of the Republic of\nKorea was born from the United Nations-supervised\nelections held pursuant to the United Nations\nresolution calling for an independent Government in\nKorea. During the Korean war, in the early 1950s, we\nwere able to defend our country, thanks to the\nparticipation and noble sacrifice of the United Nations\nforces.\nAfter the war, as the Korean people strove to\novercome the war\u2019s devastation, rebuild the country,\nachieve economic development and emerge a\ndemocracy, upholding human rights, we found\nenormous strength and encouragement in the support\nand cooperation rendered by the United Nations. The\nKorean people will never forget this. We will redouble\nour efforts to do our share for the cause of global peace\nand prosperity, as enshrined in the Charter.\nLooking back on the Republic of Korea\u2019s arduous\nand eventful process of development over the past half\ncentury, we see that it is an exemplary case of all the\ngood that can be achieved when the international\ncommunity works closely with a people determined to\novercome poverty and the legacy of conflict in order to\nbuild a better future for themselves.\nTen years have passed since the simultaneous\nadmission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to the United Nations. In\nthe intervening decade, particularly during recent\nyears, much progress has been made in inter-Korean\nrelations. Taking this opportunity, I would like to\nbriefly touch upon the peace process that is unfolding\non the Korean peninsula \u2014 an effort for which we seek\nmembers\u2019 continuing support.\nThe first inter-Korean summit, held in June 2000,\nwas truly a historic event for peace, not only on the\nKorean peninsula, but also in East Asia and indeed the\nworld. Before the summit, the Korean peninsula had\nremained a lone island where the cold war maintained\nits foothold. The summit initiated the process of\nmelting away that foothold \u2014 the icy wall of hostility\nand confrontation that had thickened between South\nand North Korea over the past half century. The whole\nworld welcomed the breakthrough, expressing high\nhopes for peace on the Korean peninsula, as\nexemplified here by the joint statement of the co-\nchairpersons of the Millennium Summit and the\nGeneral Assembly resolution.\nSince then positive changes have taken place on\nthe Korean peninsula. There have been three rounds of\nreunions by members of separated families. At the\nopening of the Sydney Olympic Games, the world was\nmoved to see South and North Korean athletes march\nin together. The project to relink a railway and road\nbetween the two Koreas is now under way. The first\nSouth-North Defence Ministers\u2019 meeting was held with\na view to reducing tension and furthering peace.\nMeanwhile, North Korea has steadily expanded\nits diplomatic horizon, establishing diplomatic ties with\nmost countries of the European Union and many\nothers. Such endeavours have been strongly welcomed\nand supported by the Republic of Korea, which has\nstriven to shore up global support for the Korean peace\nprocess.\nThe goal of our sunshine policy of promoting\nengagement between South and North Korea is for the\ntwo sides to live together in peace and cooperation, in\npreparation for peaceful unification. The engagement\npolicy is actively supported by the whole world, not to\nmention the Korean people and key neighbours\nsurrounding the Korean peninsula. North Korea, too,\nembraced the spirit of peace, reconciliation and\ncooperation Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 issued at\nthe inter-Korean summit.\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will\ncontinue to do its utmost so that a lasting peace may\ntake root on the Korean peninsula and global peace\nmay be strengthened. We sincerely thank the United\nNations and the leaders of the world for the\nencouragement they have given us so far. We shall\ncontinue to count on their steadfast support and\ncooperation.\nThe work required of the United Nations in the\ntwenty-first century is no less than daunting. Numerous\ntasks lie ahead of us, such as fostering international\npeace and security, promoting the common prosperity\nof the global village, advancing democracy and human\nrights, eradicating poverty, combating transnational\ncrime, protecting the environment and enhancing\nhuman well-being.\nRising to these challenges, world leaders gathered\nlast year at the Millennium Summit to reconfirm their\nresponsibilities and to chart a new course for the\ninternational community in the twenty-first century.\nThe Millennium Declaration aims at materializing a\n35\n\nnew United Nations that can effectively meet the many\nchallenges faced by the international community.\nIt should be appreciated in particular that the\nDeclaration sets concrete policy goals to free humanity\nfrom fear and poverty. Now the task before all States\nMembers of the United Nations is to muster the best of\ntheir wisdom and strength in devising and\nimplementing measures to fulfil the commitments\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration. The Republic\nof Korea will actively cooperate with all other\nMembers, so that these commitments may be carried\nout faithfully.\nWith the end of the cold war and the passing of\nthe twentieth century, reconciliation and cooperation\nhave come to define the tenor of the evolving global\norder. However, genuine global peace has yet to be\nobtained. In many corners of the globe, the threat of\nterrorism looms large, and conflicts and confrontations\ncaused by ethnic, religious and economic factors still\npersist. Far worse, the greatest victims are often the\nmost vulnerable groups, such as children, women and\nethnic minorities. In this regard, I fully support the\nefforts of the United Nations to strengthen its\ncapability to prevent and resolve conflicts and to deal\nwith their aftermath. The conflict prevention and\npeacekeeping function of the United Nations is\nessential for global peace, and the role of the United\nNations in post-conflict peace-building should also be\nexpanded.\nHumanity in the twenty-first century is at the\nmercy of rapid and sweeping changes that are\nunprecedented in the history of human civilization. At\nthe core of the vortex lie the information technology\nrevolution and globalization. If we fail to meet the\nchallenges posed by these trends, the promises of peace\nand prosperity in the twenty-first century will not be\nfulfilled. Member States of the United Nations must\ngather their collective wisdom and will so that all\nmembers of the international community can enjoy the\nbenefits of globalization and the revolutionary\nadvances in information and communication\ntechnology.\nAgainst this backdrop, President Kim Dae-jung\nproposed building a trans-Eurasia information network\nat the Asia-Europe Summit last year, with a view to\ngalvanizing information exchange and cooperation\nbetween Asia and Europe to an unprecedented level. In\norder to narrow the information gap between nations,\ninternational assistance is required, particularly in\nbuilding the information infrastructures and human\nresources of developing countries. In this regard,\ngreater cooperation and attention on the part of the\ndeveloped countries are essential.\nFurthermore, the effective management of the\nglobal economy and poverty eradication in the\nunderdeveloped countries should be placed high on the\nagenda of global consultations. The visibility and\ntransparency of global financial markets should be\nenhanced by reinforcing the functions of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the International\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and\nother international financial organizations.\nThe next round of World Trade Organization\n(WTO) talks should be launched as soon as possible in\norder to strengthen free trade and the multilateral\ntrading system. In this regard, I hope the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nin March of next year, will succeed in devising a\ncomprehensive plan to deal with issues related to\npoverty and development. We have to bear in mind the\nlesson drawn from history that fostering the middle-\nclass through poverty eradication can lay a solid\nfoundation for democracy.\nAs far as the environment is concerned,\ninternational efforts to protect \u201cMother Nature\u201d should\nbe carried out in a more effective and substantial\nmanner.\nIn some advanced countries, the development of\nbio-technology has reached such astonishing levels as\nto arouse fear of infringing upon the realm of God.\nWhile acknowledging the positive role such scientific\nadvancements may have in prolonging human life and\nimproving the quality of life, we need to prevent them\nfrom being misused and from becoming an affront to\nhuman dignity.\nDemocracy and human rights are universal values\nthat must continue to be sought and upheld in the\ntwenty-first century. In recent decades, democracy and\nhuman rights have claimed many victories around the\nworld, but they have also suffered setbacks. Human\nrights continue to be abused in many parts of the world\nin the form of kidnapping and torture, illegal\nexecutions, discrimination and other violations. It is\nparticularly distressing that large-scale and systematic\nviolations of human rights persist in some regions of\nconflict. Such deplorable acts cannot be tolerated. I\n36\n\nsincerely hope that the second conference of the\nCommunity of Democracies, to be held in Seoul in\nOctober of next year, will prove to be a milestone in\nthis regard.\nHumanity places great expectations upon the\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century and to make the most of the opportunities\nit brings, because this global body provides a unique\nforum for all the countries of the world together to seek\nsolutions to common problems in the spirit of mutual\nrespect and cooperation. To rise to the task, the United\nNations requires ongoing reform. Its financial and\norganizational foundations must be strengthened in\naccordance with its expanding roles. In particular, the\nreform of the Security Council, given its importance to\nall Member States, must be achieved through general\nagreement, with a view to making the Council more\nrepresentative, democratic and efficient.\nThe United Nations must stand firmly at the\ncentre of efforts to further spread and consolidate\nmultilateralism around the world, based on the spirit of\nmutual understanding and compromise. Tolerance and\ndialogue must be upheld in international relations if we\nare to make the twenty-first century an era of shared\nprosperity and peaceful coexistence among diverse\ncivilizations.\nThe Republic of Korea will strive to contribute to\nthe further development of the United Nations in the\nspirit of repaying the generosity it has received from\nthe international community. Befitting the country\u2019s\ngrowing capabilities, the Republic of Korea\u2019s\ncontribution to the United Nations budget is to increase\nsignificantly in the coming years, in accordance with\nthe new scale of assessments adopted last year. Next\nyear, it will become the tenth largest contributor to the\nregular budget of the United Nations. With its troops\nnow taking part in the Organization\u2019s peacekeeping\nmissions in East Timor and three other places, the\nRepublic of Korea will also continue to actively\nparticipate in the United Nations endeavours for peace\nand security.\nFurthermore, we will share our experiences in\neconomic development and democratization with our\nneighbours in the global village and do what we can to\nbridge the gap between the developing and developed\ncountries.\nI am convinced that the United Nations, on the\nstrength of the concerted efforts of all countries\nrepresented here, will continue to be a beacon of hope,\nlighting the road ahead for humanity in the twenty-first\ncentury.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt does seem\nstrange to congratulate Minister Han Seung-soo on his\nappointment as President of the General Assembly so\nlate in this session. But we live in unusual times. The\nUnited Nations needs clear leadership. With his\ndistinguished track record in public service in the\nRepublic of Korea, we are confident that Minister Han\nwill provide it to this Assembly. We assure him of our\nfull support.\nWe also congratulate Mr. Harri Holkeri for his\ncommendable leadership last year and, of course, the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United\nNations on the Nobel Peace Prize that they received.\nThe timing of this General Assembly indicates\nthe difficult circumstances we are in. Never before in\nits 56-year history has the United Nations had to\npostpone the general debate. Clearly, the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September have already had drastic and\nimmediate international consequences. The long-term\nconsequences are still unknown. But we can be sure\nthat they will be both powerful and wide-ranging.\nFor the short term, the events of 11 September\nhave shaken an already vulnerable world economy. The\ndeveloped world is suffering a growing economic\nslowdown. This is well known. Unfortunately, what is\nless well known are the damaging effects of the\nterrorist attacks on developing countries. In the\ndeveloped countries, which provide the principal\nengine of the world\u2019s economy, the attacks have\nundermined consumer confidence, disrupted commerce\nand destroyed wealth. But these are temporary shocks\nfrom which the developed world can and will recover.\nBut what the terrorist attacks have dramatically\nhighlighted is the reality of interdependence in today\u2019s\nglobalized world. Joseph Stiglitz, a recent Nobel Prize\nwinner, like the United Nations, highlighted this\ninterdependence in a Washington Post article dated 11\nNovember 2001. He said, \u201cIt used to be said that when\nAmerica sneezed, Mexico caught a cold. Now, when\nAmerica sneezes, much of the world catches cold. And\naccording to recent data, America is not just sneezing,\nit has a bad case of the flu.\u201d\nHence, the developing countries, which depend\non a healthy global economy for their hopes of growth\nand prosperity, face great dangers. The fear of\nterrorism may constrict the key arteries of\nglobalization. We have already seen new precautions\ntaken in many countries, at ports, airports, train\nstations, banks, media offices, government buildings,\nfactories, offices, hospitals and many other public\ninstitutions. These precautions are important to protect\ninnocent people in their daily lives. However, they also\ninevitably impose additional costs. These new\nrestrictions on travel, on shipping, on national and\ninternational mail and on the free flow of goods and\ninformation everywhere are effectively a tariff imposed\nby terrorism upon the global community. Tragically, it\nis also a regressive tariff, one that affects the poorer\nmembers of the global community more.\n34\n\nIf the arteries of globalization become\nincreasingly constricted and cease to function\neffectively, developing countries will lose their best\nchance of growing out of poverty. This will only\naggravate the hopelessness, marginalization, ignorance\nand fear that can breed terrorism. We must avoid this\nvicious cycle. In developed countries, the economic\nslowdown is already strengthening protectionist voices\ncalling for restrictions on imports, the imposition of\nnon-tariff barriers, anti-dumping duties, restrictions on\nmigration and governmental support for domestic\nindustries. A genuine concern over terrorist use of\ninternational financial and information networks could\nalso be used as a justification for restrictions on the\nflows of international investment and information. And\ndeveloping countries need these flows.\nIndeed, even before 11 September, developing\ncountries were not benefiting sufficiently from these\nflows. The greater part of foreign direct investment\n(FDI) flows mainly among developed countries. Of the\nremainder, 12 major developing countries take 75 per\ncent of private FDI to the developing world, while 140\ndeveloping countries take a share of only 5 per cent.\nThe poorest nations of the world therefore suffer not\nfrom too many connections with the wider world, but\ntoo few. Indeed, the poorest 48 countries account for\nonly 4 per cent of total world trade, while sub-Saharan\nAfrica receives only 5 per cent of the total net long-\nterm private capital flows to developing countries. At\nthe same time, in the developed countries, tariffs on the\nexport of goods of developing countries are 30 per cent\nhigher than the global average. The fact that tariffs on\ngoods of developing countries are 30 per cent higher\nthan the global average is truly a shocking statistic, and\nwe are surprised that this has not been highlighted\nbefore in key forums. All this shows that the poor\ncountries cannot afford any further restrictions on\ntrade.\nIn this regard, we are relieved that the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) meeting in Doha, Qatar,\nwhich ended yesterday, has finally agreed to launch a\nnew round of trade talks that we hope will keep the\nglobal economy on track towards freer trade and\ninvestment. Today\u2019s Wall Street Journal, which, as we\nall know, is a conservative journal, drew this link\nbetween the events of 11 September and the results of\nDoha:\n\u201cIn an effort to keep poorer nations on their\nside in the war on terrorism, United States and\nEuropean negotiators went further than anyone\nexpected to meet the demands of the developing\nworld. \u2026\n\u201cUltimately, the United States and Europe\nmade big concessions to the developing world \u2014\nconcessions fiercely resisted by pharmaceutical\nand steel companies in the United States and\nfarmers in Europe.\u201d\nThis Doha meeting therefore confirmed that the\nneeds of poorer countries will have to be addressed in\nthe months and years to come, because as a result of 11\nSeptember, poorer countries will certainly suffer more\nthan richer ones. To give another obvious example,\ntourism from richer countries is a major source of\nincome for many developing countries. But the fear of\nflying \u2014 which I think has become quite real\nnowadays \u2014 engendered by the recent terrorist attacks\nhas already caused airlines all over the world to cut\nflight schedules and in many cases terminate them\naltogether. It is already much harder to get direct\nflights from, say, New York City to many Latin\nAmerican destinations. The World Travel and Tourism\nCouncil has estimated that the events of 11 September\nmay cause the loss of up to 8.8 million jobs in the\ntravel and tourism industry. Of these, only 2.3 million\nwill be in the United States and Europe. The rest will\nbe in the developing world. Clearly, the impact on\ndeveloping countries dependent on the tourist trade\nwill be enormous.\nThe record of the past 30 years shows clearly that\ncountries better integrated into the global economic\nsystem have enjoyed greater long-term growth than\nhave relatively isolated countries. I can quote no better\nauthority than the Secretary-General, who has said,\n\u201cSuccess in achieving sustained growth depends\ncritically on expanding access to the opportunities\nof globalisation. The countries that have achieved\nhigher growth are those that have successfully\nintegrated into the global economy and attracted\nforeign investment.\u201d (Making Globalisation Work\nFor The Poor, The Independent, 12 December\n2000)\nIn a recent book, The End of Globalization:\nLessons from the Great Depression, the author Harold\nJames examines the fallout from a collapse of the\nintegrated world in an earlier era. He provides a\nsobering historical perspective on what we are\nexperiencing today. In the era before the First World\n35\n\nWar, the world was in many ways a well-integrated\nplace. Movement of capital, knowledge and labour\namong both rich and poor countries was much less\nrestricted. The rise of protectionism and isolationism in\nresponse to this led to the Great Depression of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century. This long-lasting global\nrecession ended only with the outbreak of the Second\nWorld War. This is not a cycle that we should repeat as\nwe enter the twenty-first century.\nOne big lesson of 11 September is therefore that\nglobalization, which we assume to be a powerful,\nirresistible force, is actually a very fragile construct,\ndependent on the will of its participants for its\ncontinuing existence. If it collapses \u2014 and the point to\nbear in mind is that it may collapse \u2014 developing\ncountries could suffer more. Hence, the terrorists who\ndestroyed the World Trade Center could also seriously\ndamage the global economic system that represents the\nbest chance that the developing countries have for\nlong-term development, growth and prosperity. If the\nterrorists succeed, we will all be worse off.\nHence, at the recently concluded summit of the\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in\nShanghai, China, APEC leaders representing 21\ncountries, both developed and developing, and coming\nfrom three continents, unequivocally condemned\nterrorist acts as a profound threat to the peace,\nprosperity and security of all people, all faiths and all\nnations and pledged to cooperate fully to ensure that\ninternational terrorism does not disrupt economies and\nmarkets. We are not engaged here merely in a struggle\nbetween a few developed nations and a few terrorists.\nThe whole world is involved in this struggle.\nFollowing 11 September, we in the international\ncommunity must act together to safeguard what we\nhave achieved and what we have yet to achieve. The\nstruggle against terrorism itself will take much time\nand stamina. To track down the terrorist groups and rip\nup their networks will be a difficult, long, messy and\neven tedious business, requiring the cooperative efforts\nof many countries. Countering terrorism must be an\ninternational endeavour, and in this international\nendeavour the United Nations has a critical role to play.\nThe United Nations remains the indispensable\nforum to mobilize international opinion and develop a\nstrong political consensus against terrorism. Through\nthe Security Council, it also provides a platform for\npractical cooperation, as we saw, for example, in\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Within the\nUnited Nations system several bodies are already\nseized of the various dimensions of terrorism. One\nuseful course of action would be for the various law\nenforcement and other agencies dealing with terrorism\nto get together to examine existing norms and practices\nand areas for further cooperation. Where such\ncooperation is already taking place bilaterally or\ntrilaterally among countries, the United Nations can\nserve as a useful disseminator and clearing house of\ninformation and best practices.\nIn the long term, the economic and social\nconditions that encourage terrorists must be addressed\nurgently, and certainly after 11 September, we now\nknow how urgent this task is. International economic\nintegration, while ultimately the only guarantor of\nprosperity, is today incomplete in scope and uneven in\nits distribution of costs and benefits. Many developing\ncountries remain imperfectly integrated into the world\neconomy. These problems must be addressed by\ncapacity-building and infrastructure development\nwithin developing countries, with whatever\ninternational assistance is necessary, and by the\nelimination of trade barriers and protectionism in the\ndeveloped countries.\nIt is useful here to cite the latest World Bank\nreport, which states clearly that abolishing all trade\nbarriers could boost global income by $2.8 trillion \u2014\nthat is an enormous sum \u2014 and could also lift as many\nas 320 million people out of poverty by 2015. We hope\nthat the World Trade Organization negotiators will bear\nthis in mind when they commence the new round of\nnegotiations after the Doha, Qatar, meeting.\nTo conclude, please allow me to quote the\nSecretary-General once again:\n\u201cIn an increasingly globalized world, none\nof the critical issues we are dealing with can be\nresolved within a solely national framework. All\nof them require cooperation, partnership and\nburden-sharing among Governments, the United\nNations, regional organizations, non-\ngovernmental organizations, the private sector\nand civil society.\u201d (A/56/1, para. 11)\nGlobal actions, facilitated by consultative leadership,\nare needed to address challenges of global dimensions.\nWe hope that we can make a small beginning at this\nsession of the General Assembly to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Government and the people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nhail this well-deserved international recognition of the\nimportance and quality of the work done by the\nOrganization under the leadership of the Secretary-\nGeneral.\nMy delegation extends to Mr. Kofi Annan its\nwarm and fraternal congratulations on his historic re-\nelection and on the greatly appreciated work he is\ndoing as the head of the United Nations. The\nrecognition he has just received is an illustration of the\nuniversal appreciation of his great qualities as a\ndiplomat and statesman, which he has put at the service\nof peace and development.\nIn organizing the Millennium Summit and in his\npersonal involvement in the holding of the special\nsession on HIV/AIDS, as well as his involvement in the\nspecial session on children, the Secretary-General has\nput back on the agenda the concerns of developing\ncountries in general, including those of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\nIt is absolutely vital to sensitize the international\ncommunity on matters related to the fight against\npoverty and improving protection of the rights of\nwomen and children, to mention just two areas. C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire would like to express its appreciation in this\nregard.\nFinally, the Government and the people of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire would like to express their gratitude to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his great\nunderstanding of, and support for, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nthroughout the very difficult times it has experienced\nsince the end of 1999. He demonstrated this once again\nby sending a personal representative to the forum on\nnational reconciliation that is now under way. The\nGovernment and the people of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and the\ninternational community have great hopes for that\nforum, whose success will help all participants to\ndispel misunderstandings and help C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to\nresume its economic growth in order to be able to play\nits proper role.\nMy Government attaches great importance to a\nsocial policy aimed at combating poverty and meeting\nthe needs of all sectors of our population in the areas of\nhealth, education, employment and nutrition. As part of\nthat policy, a strategy document on poverty reduction is\nbeing prepared.\nBeginning in June 2002, a health insurance plan\nwill be in place as part of a national social security\nsystem. Through that plan everyone living in C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire will be able to have health insurance,\nregardless of social status. The National Assembly\nadopted the necessary laws to that end on 9 October.\nNo effort will spared to ensure that we eliminate\nthe most serious social shortcomings as soon as\npossible. In that regard, our greatest ambition is for\ndevelopment and growth to reach the most remote\nregions and for the necessary basic services of running\nwater, electricity, schools and health-care centres to be\navailable to all the people in every village of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire. It is with this goal in mind that the\nGovernment has established a decentralization\nprogramme, thanks to which 58 departments of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire will be able to administer themselves and\noversee their own development on the basis of a\n33\n\nbudgetary packet granted to them annually through\nlegislative appropriations.\nIn order to attain these various objectives, the\nmacroeconomic framework will have to be improved\nthrough rigorous legal and budgetary measures and\nthrough good governance. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is strongly\ndetermined to do its very best in this area.\nEnsuring the well-being of children and the\nprotection of their rights is a priority for my country.\nThe special session on children will take place in a few\nmonths, and our Government places great hope in the\nfact that it will give us an opportunity to clarify the\nactions we are taking in favour of children, particularly\nin the fight against cross-border trafficking in children.\nLast June, in this very Hall, States adopted new\nmeasures and initiatives in order to ensure the effective\nimplementation of the Beijing Declaration and\nPlatform for Action. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire endorses all of these\nrecommendations and will do everything possible\nwithin the framework of a renewal policy to reach as\nquickly as possible this objective, which is intended to\nensure equal opportunity among men and women.\nThe problem of HIV/AIDS has become one of the\nmajor concerns of the world today in general and for\nAfrica in particular. UN/AIDS statistics and those of\nmany other institutions state that throughout the world\nover 30 million people are infected, of which 1.2\nmillion are children. Africa represents only 10 per cent\nof the planet\u2019s population; nevertheless, since the\nbeginning of this epidemic, 83 per cent of all deaths\ndue to AIDS have fallen to Africa. As the Secretary-\nGeneral has rightly stressed in his report of 16\nFebruary 2001, if the epidemic continues to grow at the\npresent rate, the most affected nations will see a\ndecrease of at least 25 per cent of their estimated\neconomic growth over the next 20 years. For this\nreason we are very glad to see the setting up of a\nGlobal AIDS and Health Fund at the United Nations\nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative. It would also be a good\ntime to set up mechanisms promoting the exchange of\nexperience among those countries which have managed\nto halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and those which are\nstill seeking solutions to it.\nNo country can flourish if international peace and\nsecurity are threatened, which is why C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is\nextremely concerned by an arms race which dares not\nspeak its name. As party to the Pelindaba Treaty, C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire welcomes the increasing number of treaties\nestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in different\nregions of the world.\nThe illicit proliferation and circulation of small\narms is another phenomenon that affects the African\ncontinent, and West Africa in particular. This\nphenomenon constitutes a permanent threat to peace\nand slows down development in this region, where\nover 15 million light weapons are circulating illegally.\nSince the end of the Second World War, the\ninternational community\u2019s attention has focused on\nnuclear arms. However, it is conventional small arms\nthat continue to create millions of victims. Here we\nshare the Secretary-General\u2019s opinion expressed in his\nMillennium Report: light weapons are indeed weapons\nof mass destruction. They exacerbate regional conflicts\nand contribute largely to the use of child soldiers. They\nkill women, youth and children. The insecurity that this\ncreates prohibits any possibility of smooth economic\ndevelopment.\nAs Members of the General Assembly know, on\n31 October 1998 in Abuja, Nigeria, the Heads of State\nof the Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) decreed a moratorium aimed at reducing\nthe proliferation and circulation of light weapons in\nWest Africa. During the recent African summit, which\ntook place in Lusaka in July 2001, this moratorium was\nextended for a three-year period, starting on 5 July\n2001. This struggle can be efficient only if it is led by\nthe international community as a whole, and it has to\ninvolve, of course, weapons manufacturers, official\nusers and civil society. The United Nations Conference\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\nin All Its Aspects, which was held in New York from 9\nto 20 July 2001, is in our opinion headed in the right\ndirection. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is greatly interested in the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action adopted\nby the Conference.\nEight years ago the General Assembly decided to\nundertake the reform of the Security Council. As it\nstands at the moment, the Council cannot be seen as a\ndemocratic and representative body of all United\nNations Member States. The Council\u2019s functions have\nto be reinforced so that it can continue acting\nefficiently as the United Nations body with the primary\nrole of ensuring the maintenance of international peace\nand security. In order to do this, it is urgent and right\nthat the number of permanent and non-permanent\nmembers be increased so that the composition of the\nCouncil is in line with the complexity of a world that\n34\n\nhas seen great development, both quantitative and\nqualitative, in international relations, the key aspect\nbeing the increased complexity of the problems to be\nsolved.\nIn our view, the expansion of the Council should\naim at re-adapting the whole mechanism of taking and\nimplementing decisions. This is why the exercise of the\nright of veto, equitable representation and expansion of\nmembership are all problems that have to be solved as\nsoon as possible, bearing in mind the vital urgency of\nreforming the Security Council so that all nations and\nregions of the world can be reflected within it. In this\nregard, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\nwhich has now become the African Union, seeks two\npermanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seats\nfor the African continent. Of course, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nsupports this position.\nTo make the reform of the Security Council a\nreality, it is essential for Member States of the United\nNations, particularly the five permanent members of\nthe Council, to demonstrate their firm will and\ncommitment to carry out these reforms. The primary\nduty of the United Nations, after all, is to preserve and\npromote peace throughout the world based on\ndemocratic principles. But can there be peace without\njustice or equality in relations between nations?\nThe world as a whole and the African continent in\nparticular, has been torn apart by regional conflicts and\ncivil wars that threaten international peace and\nsecurity. Various solutions proposed by the\ninternational community for laying down arms and for\nhalting the suffering of civilian populations have not\nyet, unfortunately, produced the expected results. We\nneed to find innovative and imaginative solutions that\nare political, not military. In this perspective, we\nwelcome the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\noperations, and we hope that its recommendations are\napplied as soon as possible. The impetus that the\nBrahimi report is intended to give to peacekeeping\noperations has to be encouraged and maintained.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 confirm the\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in its condemnation of all terrorist acts as\ncriminal and unjustifiable, wherever they may be\ncarried out and whoever the perpetrators may be,\nparticularly those that violate the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations, pose a threat to\ninternational peace and security and jeopardize friendly\nrelations between countries. This is why the\nGovernment of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire welcomes and firmly\nencourages the rapid conclusion of a general\nconvention on international terrorism. Such a\nconvention would undoubtedly contribute greatly to\nfighting against this scourge and would reinforce an\ninternational legal regime on terrorism. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nwill always respect the international commitments it\nhas assumed since its independence. We also feel that\nthe rule of law should be given top priority.\nWe would like to pay a well-deserved tribute here\nto the International Law Commission for its valuable\ncontribution to the development and codification of\ninternational law, in particular law relating to the\nresponsibility of States, diplomatic protection,\nunilateral acts of States, reservations to treaties and\ninternational responsibility in case of damaging\nconsequences arising from activities that are not\nprohibited by international law.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the role\nof the United Nations is crucial. Our Organization\nrepresents, in fact, the collective conscience and is, as a\nrule, the policeman of the world, able to balance the\ninterests of States \u2014 those well endowed and those not\nso well endowed \u2014 within the new globalizing\neconomy. This regulatory role for the world economy\nand for international relations can be carried out fully\nonly in an environment of international peace, justice\nand equity.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt this juncture, when humanity is faced with\nvarious challenges, it is essential that the United\nNations receive the broadest and most firm support as\nit plays the role of coordinator of our collective efforts.\nThe 2001 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to the\nSecretary-General and to the United Nations as a\nwhole, is a further reaffirmation of trust in this\nuniversal Organization, which was created to banish\nviolence and to further human development. We\nwarmly congratulate the Secretary-General and the\nofficials and employees of the Organization.\nThe international turmoil brought about by the\nterrorist attack of 11 September against the people and\nthe Government of the United States of America, as\nwell as against the highest values of the civilized\nworld, has radically altered the way in which we think\nabout international security. Our own people are not\nimmune from this new reality. Buried under the rubble\nof the World Trade Center are the remains of\nHondurans who had come to this country to turn their\nhopes into reality. The President of the United States,\nin his statement this morning, referred to the many\ncountries whose nationals perished in the twin towers.\nIt is, indeed, an international phenomenon.\nThe Presidents of the Central American countries,\nat the invitation of the President of Honduras, Mr.\nCarlos Flores, met in Honduras on 19 September and\nadopted specific joint steps to be taken at the\nsubregional level to combat terrorism. The purpose is\nto contribute, within our modest capacities, to that end,\nwhich is synonymous with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Those steps include\ncontrols on migration and financial flows and\nintelligence sharing in the framework of the\nOrganization of American States and the United\nNations.\nThe Government of Honduras notes with deep\nconcern the escalating violence in the Middle East. In\nthe light of the circumstances at the time, we supported\nthe establishment of the State of Israel. Today, we want\nto use this international forum, which plays a critical\nrole in the search for a solution in the region, to\nreaffirm the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign, free\nand secure States. We also support recognition of the\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and to the establishment of a Palestinian\nState. We are convinced that that constitutes a suitable\nformula for real peace in the Middle East.\nIn his introductory remarks today, the Secretary-\nGeneral expressed his grief and revulsion at the\ncowardly acts of international terrorism. He also wisely\nnoted that none of the other problems before us has\nbecome any less urgent. In addition to terrorism, other\ngrave dangers threaten peace and the well-being of\nindividuals. Among them is HIV/AIDS, which was the\nfocus of a special session of the General Assembly,\nheld from 25 to 27 June 2001. That collective\nendeavour led to the establishment of a global\nHIV/AIDS and health fund to support joint measures\nagainst the pandemic. The special session raised the\nlevel of understanding of the scope of the pandemic,\nwhich goes beyond health, because it also has a social\nand economic impact.\nThe June session forged links of cooperation\namong nations with a view to sharing experience and\nsolutions in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In particular,\nit is essential to reduce the cost of drugs: in Honduras,\nas in many other countries, most of the infected and\ntheir families cannot afford the necessary treatment.\nBrazil\u2019s agreements with pharmaceutical companies in\nthis field are worthy of emulation. This should be a\ngoal in dealing with diseases that hit the developing\ncountries hardest.\n38\n\nIn Honduras, we are encouraged by the fact that\nthe rate at which the virus is spreading has slowed.\nForecasts two years ago overestimated today\u2019s levels of\ninfection \u2013 although these continue to be high. The\nUnited Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\nOrganization is helping us to set up a regional AIDS\nprevention centre at San Pedro Sula to serve the entire\nCentral American region.\nExtreme poverty is another major threat to the\npeace and welfare of individuals. Here too, the United\nNations deserves the support of the entire international\ncommunity in helping overcome the causes of extreme\npoverty through strategic measures aimed at offering\nopportunities to sectors that are now excluded so that\nthey can enjoy a decent life and be a productive part of\ntheir societies. That does not mean only vocational and\ntechnological training; ignoring the hardship caused by\nwidespread illiteracy would amount to condemning 70\nper cent of the world\u2019s population to wretchedness. The\nUnited Nations has come forward with valuable\ninternational initiatives.\nFor its part, Honduras has adopted a poverty\nreduction strategy in which education plays a\nfundamental role. This grew out of a national\nconsensus which in turn holds the key to country\u2019s\nrecovery and transformation in the aftermath of\nhurricane Mitch.\nThe United Nations must promote fundamental\ndemocratic freedoms, including participation and\nlegitimate representation in decision-making processes.\nHere the Organization has played an ever-growing role\nin facilitating dialogue and promoting consensus. In\nrecent years, Honduras has held a national dialogue in\na variety of fields of vital importance for the nation\u2019s\nfuture. The results have been promising. In addition to\nformulating a national-reconstruction plan to overcome\nthe unprecedented damage caused by hurricane Mitch\nthree years ago, the Government of President Carlos\nFlores, in one of the broadest consultative processes in\nour history as a republic, has, together with our people,\nadopted a 15-year strategy for poverty reduction. That\nis the first plan of its kind, arrived at through a national\nconsensus, to be adopted by my country.\nAlleviating poverty, overcoming educational\nbackwardness, responding to epidemics and reducing\nour vulnerability to natural phenomena: all are linked\nto economic output and to its intelligent distribution.\nWe are thus aware that it is not only underpinnings in\nthe form of programmes that are needed; fairness and\njustice in international trade are also required. To be\nconsistent with the rhetoric of international trade, we\nneed better access to major markets. Agricultural\nproducts of developed countries must no longer be so\nheavily subsidized, so that the products of those of us\nwho are handicapped by our level of development can\nbe more competitive in line with the principles of that\nrhetoric. What is good for some should be good for all.\nWe need a level playing field that takes into account\nasymmetries and conditions on all sides.\nPolitical maturity in Member States is intimately\nbound up with how well those States meet their\ninternational obligations. Peace, tranquillity, the ability\nto cooperate and interdependence are all intertwined\nwith how seriously international relations are\nconducted. The much-quoted third paragraph of the\npreamble of the Charter of the United Nations says that\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, are determined\n\u201cto establish conditions under which justice and\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties\nand other sources of international law can be\nmaintained\u201d.\nIndeed, adherence to the principle of pacta sunt\nservanda and other sources of international obligations\nis a factor for building trust among States. Its absence\nposes a threat to the Organization\u2019s guiding spirit and\nto the principles that are its pillars.\nThe President of Mexico, His Excellency Mr.\nVicente Fox, has invited the States of the Caribbean to\nattend a conference to promote the implementation of\ntheir commitments on maritime limits under the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As a State\nparty to that Convention, my country supports the\nMexican Government\u2019s initiative. Moreover, on a\nbilateral level, we are pursuing in good faith and in\nconformity with international law the early conclusion\nof treaties on maritime limits with our Caribbean Sea\nneighbours. We applaud the efforts now under way\nunder a special process, sponsored by the Organization\nof American States, by our neighbours Belize and\nGuatemala towards a final solution to the century-long\nterritorial dispute. Such a solution should include, to\nthe extent possible and with the participation of the\nthree States directly concerned \u2014 Belize, Guatemala\nand Honduras \u2014 the adoption of stable legal\nagreements on cooperation in the Gulf of Honduras.\n39\n\nHonduras believes that disputes are an integral\npart of inter-State relations. What is alarming is not\nthat there should be differences between States; rather,\nit is the attitude with which they are approached.\nSimilarly, we note that domestic political concerns\nshould not be allowed to interfere with shared interests\nin subregional integration. To allow our domestic\npolitical goals to affect our integration process would\nmean endangering the future of integration itself, and\nthus the future of the shared interests of the Central\nAmerican countries.\nWe have a united Organization, all of whose\nvarious bodies and specialized agencies are working\never more closely together in pursuit of specific\nobjectives. This is a time of extraordinary importance\nfor the international community and hence for the\nUnited Nations and all of its Member States.\nAccordingly, we must work ever harder to promote the\nvalues of peace and human development that we all\nshare. In this endeavour, all countries, small and large,\nmust abide by the guidelines which we, the majority,\nhave agreed upon in order to save our planet from\nclimate change, whose damaging effects are making\nthemselves felt everywhere.\nAt this juncture the Organization should continue\nand expand its leadership and allow all peaceful\ninternational players, including the Republic of China\non Taiwan, to participate in the joint combat against the\nrenewed threats to peace, security and the welfare of all\nnations. All of this applies to the international arena.\nAt the national level, organization at the local\ncommunity level is essential in order to dispel\nuncertainty, overcome indifference and strengthen\nhuman solidarity based on reason. This was the case\nduring the recent floods along the Atlantic coast of\nHonduras. As a result of the preparation and prevention\nprogrammes promoted by the Administration of\nPresident Flores, the loss of life was minimal, and\nemergency support services operated effectively and in\na timely manner. This was because the local\ncommunities had learned how to prevent most of the\ndamage caused by such natural phenomena.\nThe lesson is clear: at the national and\ninternational levels, we must try to organize our work\nas individuals and as countries and to coordinate those\nefforts in order to reduce our vulnerability in all areas,\nbe they environmental, economic, political or security-\nrelated, on the basis of the principles of a culture of\npeace, which we have agreed upon together.\nIn a few months\u2019 time, President Flores will\nconclude his term of office. He will leave behind a\nstable country with transparency restored, the rule of\nlaw strengthened and a macroeconomic administration\nrecognized by the international community \u2014 a\ncountry that has recorded positive economic growth\ndespite having suffered the greatest natural disaster in\nour history.\nI conclude this address \u2014 the last to be delivered\nby the present Government of Honduras in the General\nAssembly\u2019s general debate \u2014 by conveying the\ngreetings and appreciation of the people of Honduras\nand of the Government of President Flores to the\ninternational community and to all of the peoples who\nhave stood by us during the most difficult moments of\nour history. Those have included, as we will all recall,\nthe terrible hurricane of 1998 and its negative\nconsequences, which have affected us ever since. We\nHondurans have renewed our faith in international\nsolidarity and have grown stronger in our conviction\nthat the destiny of our nation and of our planet hinges\non what we are doing today to build a future for our\nnations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to convey our\ndeepest condolences to the American people and\nGovernment for today's plane crash and to express our\ndeepest sympathies to the families of the victims for\ntheir tragic loss. Our condolences also extend to the\npeople and Government of the Dominican Republic,\nwhose nationals comprised most of those on board.\nPleading for concerted action against terrorism\nand for urgent accession by States to all relevant\ninternational conventions, the Millennium Summit\nanticipated the need for more effective and\ncomprehensive joint efforts and cooperation. The tragic\nevents of 11 September united the world and reaffirmed\nthe resolve of all of us to fight the battle against\nterrorism, gathered around our common values and\ninterests. That unprecedented terrorist attack took place\nduring the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations. The fatal message of terrorism is to\ndestroy the very essence of dialogue as a global\nresponse to conflict and violence.\nBy adopting several resolutions, the United\nNations demonstrated powerful solidarity and readiness\nto combat terrorism. Today that has been reaffirmed by\nSecurity Council resolution 1377 (2001), which\nadopted a declaration on the global effort to combat\nterrorism.\nBy expressing its strong condemnation of the\nattacks and its solidarity with the American people and\nGovernment, my country, the Republic of Macedonia,\nimmediately joined the call to establish a global\ninternational anti-terrorist coalition. We undertook\nconcrete measures as our contribution to the global\nefforts and to cooperation to curb terrorist activities.\nAs a response to terrorism and conscious of the\nfact that terrorism transcends borders, we also\nproposed the establishment of a regional anti-terrorist\npact, stemming from our terrible experience with\nterrorism over the last eight months. We called upon\nthe international community to cut off financial support\nfor terrorist activities and, in that context, to strengthen\nthe fight against organized crime, aware of the strong\nlink between those evil phenomena. The resolution of\nregional conflicts is yet another significant contribution\nwe can make to the fight against terrorism.\nWith regard to relevant international instruments,\nwe believe that the existing United Nations\nconventions provide a solid international legal\nframework for the implementation of many measures\nintended to eradicate terrorism. While we strongly\nsupport the adoption of a comprehensive convention\nagainst terrorism and a consensus on a global definition\nof terrorism, their lack should not prevent us from\ntaking action.\nAction is needed now, from all of us  all\ncountries, regions and international organizations.\nThere is no alternative to international cooperation and\npartnership, as there is no alternative to the common\nfight against organized crime, which feeds terrorism.\nBut there is one matter we have to keep in mind:\ndifferent approaches towards acts of terrorism\nundermine our struggle. There is no big or small\nterrorism, nor international or domestic, nor one that is\ntolerated and one that is not. No one should be allowed\nto practice terror; the consequences are equally\ndevastating. We have to defend more vigorously than\never our shared values of democracy, human rights and\nthe rule of law. We must not allow ourselves to be\nmanipulated through the use of social, economic,\nreligious and political differences as justification for\nterrorism.\nFor the past 10 years the Republic of Macedonia\nhas developed a democratic society, a factor of stability\nin the Balkans. Our model of inter-ethnic relations was\nset out as an example and was applauded by the\n39\n\ninternational community. Then, eight months ago,\nMacedonia was exposed to violent terrorist attacks that\nthreatened to undermine all our achievements. Under\nthe cloak of struggling for minority and human rights,\nthe so-called National Liberation Army (NLA) \u2500\nwhose structure, command and control and logistics are\nof Kosovo provenance \u2500 wanted to realize one aim: the\ndivision of Macedonia and changing the borders in the\nregion.\nOur response to those attacks was military,\npolitical and diplomatic. The Framework Agreement of\n13 August of this year, which was signed by the leaders\nof the four main political parties, is a result of our\nstrong commitment to finding a political solution to the\ncrisis as the best way to defend our country and\nundermine the goals of the terrorists. But let me\nreiterate that we will also defend our country by other\nmeans if necessary.\nThe cost of terrorism for Macedonia was high:\nlost lives, destroyed homes and thousand of refugees\nand internally displaced persons. The crisis also caused\neconomic downfall and a large budget deficit. It has\nhad a negative impact on the country's development\nand has increased unemployment and poverty rates. I\ntherefore urge the international community, financial\ninstitutions and, in particular, the European Union to\naddress our needs at the upcoming donors' conference\nand to consider the possibility of writing off our\nforeign debts.\nAt this point, allow me to underline that the\ninternational community gives strong political support\nto the Republic of Macedonia. The European Union,\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) and NATO are playing an important\nrole in overcoming the crisis, for which we are\ngrateful.\nI would also like to commend the prompt reaction\nby the Security Council. The awareness that the\nproblems in Macedonia were largely inspired in and\nimported from neighbouring Kosovo resulted in the\nadoption of resolution 1345 (2001), by which the\nCouncil, inter alia, strongly condemned extremist\nviolence, including terrorist activities, and supported\nthe Macedonian Government in its efforts to end the\nviolence in a manner consistent with the rule of law.\nOn 26 September the Council adopted resolution 1371\n(2001), which supported the full implementation of the\nFramework Agreement and rejected the use of violence\nin pursuit of political goals. Even though the United\nNations was not directly involved in the resolution of\nthe crisis in Macedonia, it is present on the ground\nthrough its agencies, working in cooperation with the\nGovernment to alleviate the consequences. We are\ngrateful for their help, too.\nDespite the efforts of the Republic of Macedonia\nand the international community, attempts are still\nbeing made to block the work of the parliament and to\nobstruct the implementation of the Framework\nAgreement. The latest events in the Tetovo area, the\ndeath of three policemen and the kidnapping of\nMacedonian civilians are proof that violence continues.\nWe should all condemn these obstacles to peace and\nstability. Macedonia is determined to pursue the path of\npeace and will not allow these events to blur our vision\nand detract us from our main goals of building a strong\ndemocracy at home and becoming integrated into Euro-\nAtlantic structures.\nThe recent history of crises has shown more than\never the importance of cooperation and solidarity\namong the countries of our region, and we have acted\naccordingly. The integration into the European Union\nand NATO is a common goal of all the countries in the\nregion of South-Eastern Europe. We are all aware that\nmembership is a solution to lasting stability and\nprosperity.\nWe are determined to contribute to the\nstrengthening of international peace and security, to\nenhancing international cooperation in all areas and to\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations. This year,\nthe Republic of Macedonia submitted, and the First\nCommittee adopted without a vote, a draft resolution\non the maintenance of international security  good-\nneighbourliness, stability and development in South-\nEastern Europe. That resolution was co-sponsored by\n46 Member States.\nThe struggle against terrorism must not deter us\nfrom taking up other important parts of the United\nNations agenda. At last year's Millennium Summit we\nidentified the direction of future United Nations\nactivities to which we committed ourselves: the\neradication of poverty, the struggle against AIDS,\nconflict prevention and the protection of the\nenvironment. On this occasion, however, let me refer to\nthe matter of the rights and well-being of children, and\nin that context to reiterate the importance of the\nupcoming special session on children as a forum to\n40\n\nreview the progress achieved and the further steps that\nneed to be taken for the benefit of children all over the\nworld.\nFurthermore, globalization remains one of the\nmost important issues on the international agenda. It is\nobvious that there are some essential problems that\nneed to be addressed immediately. In the new\nmillennium, it is crucial for the international\ncommunity to address the development agenda in a\nmore appropriate way. We believe that the United\nNations has a major role to play in this process. Next\nyear's International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment are the most important events in this\nrespect, and we should all contribute as best we can to\ntheir successful outcome. Another important issue is\nthe launching of the new comprehensive trade\nnegotiations under World Trade Organization\npatronage, with special emphasis on the problems of\nmarginalization, sustainable development and\nimplementation of all multilateral environmental\nagreements.\nAfter 11 September, the world changed. We have\nto adjust to the new realities. There are many\nchallenges ahead of us, and the United Nations has to\nbe better prepared to deal with them. That will require\neven greater commitment on our part. The strength and\nthe success of our Organization depend on the resolve\nof all its Members to respond to the new realities in a\nmore efficient, relevant and adroit manner. We all have\nour part to play in this respect. This is the best\ncontribution we can make to building a better world for\nall of us.\nLast, but not least, allow me also to extend my\nsincere congratulations to the United Nations and to its\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, on the Nobel Peace\nPrize award. This is yet another proof of the lasting\nrelevance of the principles and values of our\nOrganization as enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter and of the outstanding leadership of its\nSecretary-General.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session\nthat is taking place under extraordinary circumstances,\nwhen the whole world is still reeling in shock from the\nworld\u2019s most terrible terrorist attacks, carried out in\nNew York and Washington. This unprecedented action,\naimed against the civilian population, has provided yet\none more confirmation that terrorism poses a threat to\nthe whole world and has highlighted the relevance of\nthe proposals to join the international community\u2019s\nefforts in its common fight against terrorism, drug\ntrafficking and organized crime.\nOur country calls for international legal norms to\nbe strengthened and for further mobilization of States\u2019\nefforts to counter international terrorism. Taking into\nconsideration the developments in the world that are\nidentified with this growing threat, we support the\ninitiative regarding the early adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention against international\nterrorism.\nAfghanistan\u2019s transformation into one of the sore\nspots of our planet was a matter of concern for\nKazakhstan well before the events of 11 September.\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the President of the\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbaev, taking\ninto account the potential danger of a spillover of the\nintra-Afghan conflict, proposed to convene a special\nmeeting of the Security Council devoted to the\nconsideration of the situation in Afghanistan and\nCentral Asia in order to devise comprehensive\nmeasures to settle the situation in the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan.\nWelcoming Security Council resolution 1378\n(2001), unanimously adopted on 14 November, we\nshare the Secretary-General\u2019s view that the Security\nCouncil should adopt a comprehensive approach to\nsettling the situation in the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan and its political, military, economic,\nhumanitarian and human rights dimensions. Such an\napproach, in his opinion, ought to be based on a careful\ndiagnosis of the current situation in Afghanistan, based\non the premise that no military solution to the Afghan\nconflict is possible, or indeed acceptable, since\nterritorial gains achieved on the battlefield do not\nconstitute a basis for the legitimatization of power.\nThe issue of nuclear disarmament and non-\nproliferation is of special significance to our country.\nThis year we mark the tenth anniversary of our\nindependence, as well as the tenth anniversary of the\nshutdown of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground,\nwhich represented an important step towards a nuclear-\nfree, stable and safe world and its deliverance from the\nspectre of global Armageddon. The harm that was done\nfirst and foremost to the people of Kazakhstan was\nacknowledged by the participants of the conference\nentitled \u201cThe Twenty-First Century: Towards a\nNuclear-Weapon-Free World\u201d, which was held from 29\nto 30 August 2001 in Almaty.\nNuclear-weapon tests have caused the destruction\nof the landscape, ecosystem, economic structure and\ntraditional way of life of the people in the affected\nareas, which happen to be the historical centres of\nKazakh statehood and culture. We are grateful to our\npartners who, in line with the three resolutions adopted\nby the General Assembly, are helping to rehabilitate the\narea of the testing ground, including the conversion of\ninfrastructure. Yet, much remains to be done. We\nbelieve that the financial aid, experience and expertise\nof international organizations, donor countries and non-\ngovernmental entities play an important role in\naddressing the problems of the affected region. The\noutcome of the Almaty Conference has demonstrated\nthat the well-being of the planet, which is so cherished,\nshould be achieved not through threats and the use of\nweapons, but exclusively through peaceful means such\nas negotiation and dialogue.\nAcknowledging the necessity of strengthening\nstability and security at both the regional and global\nlevels, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan,\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbaev, addressing the forty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, put forward an\ninitiative to convene a conference on interaction and\nconfidence-building measures in Asia. Leaders of 16\nAsian countries are to meet for the first time in Almaty\nin the first half of the year 2002 to discuss threats to\nregional peace and security, to arrive at a shared vision\nof forms and modalities of addressing such threats and\nto agree on confidence-building measures and the\nestablishment of the structures and institutions of the\nConference. The work carried out so far shows that\ncompromise solutions are quite possible, even with\nrespect to differences that seem irreconcilable. In that\ncontext, the Conference represents a forum based on\nprinciples that are conceptually new for Asia, namely,\n37\n\ntrust and cooperation as a means to ensure security and\nstability.\nGlobalization, which has become a dominant\nfactor in international life, opens up vast opportunities\nfor social and economic development. At the same time\nthe United Nations should actively help to solve\ncurrent global trends associated with serious problems.\nWe call for an increased contribution on the part of the\nOrganization to improving the global environment for\nsustainable development and to bridging the gap\nbetween developed and developing countries. The\ndevelopment of a globalization model for the modern\nworld \u2014 beginning with its economic component \u2014\nthat would fully take into account the interests of all\ncountries could become a priority objective of the\nOrganization within the framework of the current\nreforms at the United Nations. More active efforts by\nthe United Nations to promote the integration of\neconomies in transition into the world economy are\nbecoming especially important for Kazakhstan.\nAgainst the background of irreversible growth in\nglobal interrelationship, regional integration, which is\nactively supported by our country, is gaining\nmomentum. Kazakhstan attaches great importance to\ncooperation within the framework of the Economic\nCooperation Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the\nCentral Asian Economic Community and other regional\neconomic organizations, and will contribute as much as\nit can to building up their capacity and their\ninternational standing. We consider it a priority to\ndevelop cooperation with the United Nations in such\nareas as strengthening the social security system\nthrough efforts to fight poverty and unemployment;\ndeveloping transportation infrastructure by maintaining\nand improving highways and railroads; solving the\nproblems of rivers in border areas; and supplying\ndrinking water in a number of regions.\nWe intend to take full advantage of the\ngeographical position of our country and of the\nfavourable location of continental transit routes. That\nendeavour will be helped by an international\nministerial conference of land-locked countries devoted\nto transit and transportation issues, which will be\nconvened in Kazakhstan in 2003 with the assistance of\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment.\nA transition to environmentally sound and\nsustainable development is a priority goal of the\nstrategy to ensure the economic growth of Kazakhstan.\nStabilizing and improving the quality of the\nenvironment in the Aral Sea basin are of overriding\nimportance to our country. Kazakhstan has called, and\nwill continue to call, for an integrated approach to\nsolving the problems of the Aral Sea and for wider\nparticipation in the effort being made by the\nprogrammes of the United Nations system.\nThe participation of the United Nations is also\nimportant in solving the host of problems related to the\ndevelopment of the Caspian Sea region. The problem\nof the Caspian Sea has outgrown its regional\nboundaries and has become global. As an effective tool\nof regional and global economic partnership, the\nUnited Nations has a role to play to implement a policy\nof preventive diplomacy in the region in order to work\nout an agreed programme for the development of the\nCaspian Sea.\nThe process of globalization, which is\ncharacterized by growing interdependence among\nStates in all spheres of life, presents new challenges for\nthe international community. In those circumstances,\nmultilateral efforts by the community of nations to find\nadequate answers to new challenges and threats play an\nexceptionally important role. Kazakhstan supports\nstrengthening the central role and authority of the\nUnited Nations in efforts to ensure global stability and\nto build equitable relations between States and peoples\nbased on mutual respect and universal values. We call\nfor increased efficiency of the United Nations system\nas a whole, including the Security Council, its principal\norgan responsible for the maintenance of international\npeace and security. In that regard, Kazakhstan fully\nsupports the need for adequate implementation of the\ndecisions taken at the Millennium Summit and fully\nshares the development goals and objectives set out by\nthe international community in the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nThe recent decision to award the Nobel Peace\nPrize to the United Nations and its Secretary-General is\na sign of recognition of the Organization\u2019s contribution\nto strengthening international cooperation \u2014\ncooperation aimed at the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity for the sake of succeeding generations and in\nthe interests of the prosperity of the peoples of all\ncountries. That award has demonstrated that the United\n38\n\nNations plays a special role in efforts to strengthen\nglobal partnerships for international purposes.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am honoured to address\nthe General Assembly. Speaking on behalf of the\npeople and the Government of Tuvalu, I extend\nTuvalu\u2019s greetings to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession and our congratulations to the President and the\nVice-Presidents of the Assembly on their election. I\n22\n\nalso pledge Tuvalu\u2019s full support and cooperation\nduring their term of office.\nAs we come to the end of this general debate, we\nare still overshadowed by the loss of many innocent\nlives and property as the result of the barbaric terrorist\nattack on America in September. We are further\nsaddened by the losses earlier this week resulting from\nthe plane accident in our host state, New York, and our\nhost country, America. Tuvalu therefore joins others in\nreiterating to the people and Government of America\nour strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks and our\npledge of strong solidarity with the United States of\nAmerica.\nLet me also convey Tuvalu\u2019s deepest sorrow and\nsympathy to the families of the victims of the plane\ncrash, and offer our prayers to the people and\nGovernment of America, and equally to the people and\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic. We wholly\nshare their bereavement and grief.\nAs the newest Member of the United Nations,\nhaving joined on the eve of the historic Millennium\nSummit last year, Tuvalu is more than ever aware of its\nresponsibilities to the United Nations and what the\nOrganization stands for. In June this year, Tuvalu\nestablished its Permanent Mission here in New York.\nAlthough this has been costly, Tuvalu believes the cost\nis offset by what the United Nations stands for. Our\npresence in the General Assembly reflects a basic\nbelief we hold true: that the United Nations, through its\nenfranchising activities, can help Tuvalu and other\ncountries like us by being an advocate with regard to\nthe issues that concern us most.\nTuvalu is proud that the Nobel Peace Prize for\n2001 was awarded to our Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations itself. This award is a telling\nrecognition of the vast contributions the United\nNations has made in so many fields and on so many\nfronts: to peace around the world; to the protection of\nthe individual, no matter his or her origin or\ncircumstances; and to the upholding of the basic United\nNations principle that every human being should have\nevery opportunity to lead a better and more fulfilling\nlife. We congratulate the Secretary-General and the\nOrganization for this recognition.\nThere is no doubt in Tuvalu that peace and\nstability are indispensable to the well-being of\nfreedom-loving people everywhere. The world cannot\nignore threats to peace and stability, no matter what\ntheir causes may be, be they economic, social or\nenvironmental. The terrorist attacks in the United\nStates of America and what has happened around the\nworld since 11 September have made those of us here\nin this great Hall today feel very anxious. However, the\nvery cause of this anxiety points clearly to the proper\nrole of the United Nations. The General Assembly\nmust be a strong advocate of what the Secretary-\nGeneral, in his new road map, calls a new \u201cculture of\nprevention\u201d.\nIn our view, pursuit of this new culture is worthy\nand must take advantage of the new spirit of\ncooperation that is now emerging to facilitate the\nelimination of the causes of terrorism and threats to\npeace and stability. In this regard, it is imperative to\naddress problems in an open and representative\ndialogue based on consensus and mutual respect and\nunderstanding.\nThe consensus-building approach that we in the\nPacific region often call the \u201cPacific way\u201d may well\nprove useful in our collective venture for universal\ncooperation. Tuvalu is committed to its obligation to\nadhere to the United Nations resolutions to eliminate\nterrorism, and thus is taking steps to accede to the 12\nUnited Nations and international conventions on\nterrorism. But to honour such obligations in practice is\neasier said than done. We need technical and financial\nsupport from the international community to build up\nour legislative, surveillance and enforcement tools if\nwe are to have any hope of meeting these obligations\nbeyond our present capabilities.\nAlso, we must not lose sight of the need for\nstrong coalitions to deal with other pressing global\nissues, including conflicts and wars; the challenges of\nglobalization; poverty and underdevelopment; and the\neffects of environmental degradation and climate\nchange.\nUniversal cooperation against threats to peace\nand stability cannot, however, be fully achieved as long\nas the United Nations lacks the will to recognize fair\nand just representation within it of a democratic and\neconomically developed State with a population of 23\nmillion. The Republic of China on Taiwan is also\nsuffering in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist\nattacks, having lost innocent lives as well as property.\nLike us, they suffer from the onslaught of natural\ndisasters; epidemics and diseases, including the HIV/\nAIDS pandemic; and other threats of instability.\n23\n\nYet in all these crises, and despite their enormous\ncontribution to the world economy and international\ndevelopment \u2014 including technological\nadvancement \u2014 as well as their consistent\ndemonstration of international responsibility, the\npeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan have been\nleft to fend for themselves, denied the right to proper\nrepresentation and collaboration, not only in the United\nNations and its specialized agencies, such as the World\nHealth Organization, but in nearly every other\nintergovernmental body. The voice with which they\ncould share their plight and thereby benefit from world\ncooperation is silenced. However, the irony is that for\nmore than 50 years, no authority other than the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan itself has had full\nsovereign control over Taiwan, its population and the\nrunning of its affairs. To visit the country, for example,\none must have immigration papers issued by its own\nauthorities.\nWhile we welcome the wise decision of the\nWorld Trade Organization last week to admit the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, it is Tuvalu\u2019s strong\nview that the United Nations must take the lead and\nseriously reconsider United Nations membership for\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, beyond the politics\nof exclusion and on the basis of the reality of things.\nIn Tuvalu and many other countries in the Pacific,\nwe know that our economic vulnerability is fertile\nground for forces of terror that can threaten the security\nand survival not only of the islands, but also of the\nregion and the world. We are worried about the\ngrowing global interdependence and what that may\nbring to our shores. We need to improve our ability to\nshare and disseminate information on transnational\ncrimes, particularly those involving drug trafficking,\nmoney laundering, bogus investments, and other\ndangerous and dubious schemes that often arrive in the\nPacific islands under the pretext of being legitimate.\nWe believe that, if we are left on our own, these\nthreats will continue to expose Tuvalu and other Pacific\nisland countries to forces outside our control. It is vital,\ntherefore, that individual Pacific island Governments\nbe given the back-up that is needed to boost their\nability to tackle security threats and fight crime. The\nexisting regional security arrangements under the\nPacific Islands Forum and its sister regional agencies\nin the Pacific can, indeed, play a vital role. However,\nthey need to be further strengthened to enable them to\ncomplement national security efforts more effectively.\nFurther solidifying of cooperation between our regional\norganizations and the United Nations, moreover, is\nfundamental to the success of national and regional\nefforts vital for regional and global security.\nI should like to add here that Tuvalu highly\ncommends the role played by the United Nations and\nother international organizations and major countries in\nhelping restore peace in the Pacific following the\nrecent turbulence in the region.\nTuvalu is not in a good position to take advantage\nof the opportunities offered by trade liberalization.\nLike many island countries, Tuvalu currently lacks the\nknow-how, trained people and adequate infrastructure\nto reap the benefits that are enjoyed here. If there is\nbenefit for Tuvalu in a free trade world \u2014 and we\nbelieve there is \u2014 then surely Tuvalu must have in\nplace the means that would allow us to reap that\nbenefit.\nIn more ways than one, small island developing\nStates such as Tuvalu are at the sharp end, the cutting\nedge, of development. For us, overseas development\naid is indispensable to the development and sustenance\nof basic services necessary for security and survival.\nOur priorities continue to be education, health services\nand fresh water.\nWhile we commend with great appreciation the\ngenerosity of our development partners, particularly\nour traditional partners, it has to be noted that Tuvalu\nand other small island developing States, like the\nlandlocked and least developed countries and other\ndeveloping countries, will for some time continue to\nrely on external financing through official development\nassistance to address their unique development needs.\nIn our view, the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, both of which will be held\nnext year, must also capitalize on the premises laid out\nunder the reviewed Barbados Programme of Action for\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\nDeveloping States, the outcome of the United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries and the\nSecretary-General\u2019s road map towards the\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration as the key tools to address the unique\ncircumstances and vulnerabilities of small island\ndeveloping States. Ultimately, this must lead to more\neffective delivery of assistance that is flexible and\nmore responsive to the sustainable development needs\n24\n\nof small island developing States and of developing\ncountries in general.\nWith limited exploitable resources, Tuvalu, like\nmany other small island developing States, relies\nheavily on the surrounding seas for its food security\nand economic development. The proper protection of\nthe oceans from hazardous pollution is therefore vital,\nand the sustainable management and exploitation of\nfisheries and other marine resources is extremely\nimportant to our sustainable development and survival.\nBuilding local capacity to conserve, manage and\nharvest marine resources in a sustainable manner is\ncrucial and should therefore be supported.\nAs has already been said in this debate, the\nbiggest long-term threat to the people of Tuvalu is\nposed by the effects of climate change, in particular\nrising sea levels. Recent reports released by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have\nconfirmed beyond doubt the correlation between\naccelerated atmospheric warming and sea-level rise. In\nTuvalu too it is our strong belief that the weather is\ngrowing more severe, hotter and drier, and that there\nhave been unusually high seas eroding foreshores and\nintruding into freshwater lenses. We believe that the\ncumulative effect of carbon dioxide emissions in\nindustrial and other countries into the atmosphere has,\nin sum, created a future that is very uncertain in\nTuvalu.\nIt may not be known in this Hall but unique\nwithin the United Nations membership are the\nMaldives, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu.\nThose four countries are the only Member States that\nconsist entirely of low-lying coral atolls and reef\nislands. In the event of further rising sea levels, where\nare we to hide? Eventually asking countries to take us\nin as environmental refugees is not what Tuvalu is after\nin the long run. What we prefer is that our great-\ngrandchildren should grow up the way I did and the\nway my wife and our brothers and sisters did in our\nisland communities, learning the traditions, customs\nand culture of Tuvalu, and living our way of life.\nTuvalu is not alone in sharing that view. Tens of\nmillions of people who live on islands or in coastal\ncommunities face the gloomy onslaught of rising sea\nlevels. Such vulnerable geography is everywhere. How\nironic it would be if decades from now the last Member\nto enter the United Nations, Tuvalu, were the first\nMember State to withdraw because it had disappeared\nwithout a trace.\nIn the shrinking world we live in, environmental\npollution has never known artificial boundaries. The\npresence of higher than normal levels of greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere is a legacy of development in\nindustrial countries spanning the past 200 years. I hope\nthat industrial countries realize that nature is now\nimposing a penalty for that development.\nUnfortunately, it is Tuvalu and others with little or\nnothing to do with the causes which are now forced to\npay.\nWhile we are heartened by the positive outcome\nof the seventh Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\nheld at Marrakesh, and while we are looking forward to\nthe full implementation of that Convention and of the\nKyoto Protocol commitments, we would also hope that\ngoodwill will prevail beyond instruments and\nconventions to assist those most affected to adapt to the\nimmediate and long-term effects of climate change.\nThis is not the time to shrink from environmental\nand survival responsibility. Like the international war\nbeing waged against terrorism, a global solution to the\nthreat posed by climate change and sea-level rise will\nsave Tuvalu and many other small island States from\ndisappearing. Our collective resolve to remove causes\nof terrorism and threats to peace and security, including\npoverty and underdevelopment, HIV/AIDS and\nenvironmental degradation, will ensure a truly peaceful\nand secure village for all of humanity.\nMay God bless the United Nations; may God\nbless its peoples.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe terrorist attacks of\n11 September are going to thoroughly change the\nworld, but we do not yet know how. The aftermath of\nthese events has shown that there are more issues that\nunite us than issues that separate us. We also know that\npreventing terrorism and other global threats requires\nthe broadest possible cooperation. The United Nations\nis the main forum for such cooperation. This was\ndemonstrated immediately after the attacks, when both\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council\npromptly condemned the terrorist attacks as threats to\ninternational peace and security and expressed their\nreadiness to combat all forms of terrorism. Now it is\nextremely urgent to finalize the negotiations on a\ncomprehensive convention on the suppression of\ninternational terrorism. I appeal to everyone to quickly\nagree on the outstanding draft in question.\nThese attacks have also profoundly affected our\nsense of security, both as Member States and as\nindividuals. Fear and insecurity were globalized\novernight. But democratic societies cannot be\ndestroyed by such acts. When faced with threats our\ncommon values and democracy will only get stronger.\nFinland condemns terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations, and whoever its victims may be. There\nis no justification for it.\nI extend, on behalf of the Government of Finland,\nour condolences to the families of the victims, to the\ncitizens of New York and to all Americans, including\nPresident Bush. We have expressed our solidarity with\nthe United States, as we would have done with any\nother country affected by such attacks.\nThe rapidly changing world and the new threats\nrequire changed thinking in the international\norganizations. We must respond quickly and efficiently\nto the challenges of the real world. We cannot bury\nourselves in old rhetoric and positions when people\noutside require concrete action and help. International\ncooperation, after all, benefits all States, big and small.\n23\n\nI hope that the unique coalition and cooperation against\nterrorism will be reflected on other issues of common\nconcern to us.\nThe statement in the Millennium Declaration that\nthe United Nations is\n\u201cthe indispensable common house of the entire\nhuman family, through which we will seek to\nrealize our universal aspirations for peace,\ncooperation and development\u201d (resolution 55/2,\npara. 32)\nis now truer than ever. The fight against terrorism and\nthe Afghan situation are at the top of the United\nNations agenda, but there are other issues and\nprocesses that require true cooperation in order to be\nsuccessful. In this context, I would like to underline the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\nthe world conferences on sustainable development,\nfinancing for development and children.\nOne of our common responsibilities is the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This is\none of the issues that unites us and is in everybody\u2019s\ninterest. The United Nations is the only international\norganization with global competence in the area of\nsecurity policies. Ongoing crises are, however, so\ncomplex that they require united efforts and combined\nresources. This is particularly true of the Middle East,\nwhere a return to the peace process is an urgent\nnecessity. To this end, we will have to pressure both\nparties, as well as those who can influence them.\nThe complexity of international crises has\nrequired a close and comprehensive look by the United\nNations at how to improve its performance in peace\noperations. The whole continuum that reaches from\nconflict prevention, through crisis management to post-\nconflict peace-building, with a strong emphasis on\npreventive action in every phase, requires a fresh\napproach, as proposed in the report of the Brahimi\nPanel and in the comprehensive review of the\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. Finland\nsupports the full implementation of such an approach.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\nprevention of armed conflicts and its recommendations\nare important contributions to the core activities of the\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General\u2019s call,\nreiterated by the Security Council, on the development\nof a comprehensive conflict-prevention strategy is\ntimely and warranted. By the adoption of the\nProgramme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, the\nEuropean Union has underlined its political\ncommitment to pursue conflict prevention as one of the\nmain objectives in its external relations. This is also a\ngood example of mutually supportive actions by the\nUnited Nations and the European Union. This is again\nan issue that requires a holistic view and a system-wide\napproach.\nFinland supports increased focus on the part of\nthe United Nations on crisis prevention and the root\ncauses of conflicts. Promotion of democracy, human\nrights, the rule of law, increased equality and social\ndevelopment, as well as the prevention of\nenvironmental threats and the eradication of poverty,\ndiscrimination, racism and impunity, all point in the\nsame direction.\nThe complexity of current crises \u2014 be they in\nAfghanistan, the Middle East, the Balkans or Africa \u2014\nand the limited resources available have made different\norganizations seek cooperation and complementarity in\ntheir actions. Chapter VIII of the United Nations\nCharter puts strong emphasis on regional arrangements\naimed at dealing with issues relating to international\npeace and security. The Security Council should utilize\nsuch regional arrangements for enforcement action.\nThe European Union is in the process of\ndeveloping its own crisis-management capability, in\nterms of both civilian and military capacities. In this\nwork, Finland, just like the entire European Union, is\ncommitted to contributing to international peace and\nsecurity, in accordance with the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nThe European Union has adopted conclusions on\nits cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis\nmanagement with the United Nations. Areas and\nmodalities for such cooperation have been identified in\nclose cooperation with the United Nations. It will\nprogress as the European Common Security and\nDefence Policy develops its focus on substantive issues\nand concrete needs in a pragmatic manner. This\ncooperation focuses on conflict prevention, civilian and\nmilitary aspects of crisis management and on regional\ncrises like the ones in the western Balkans, the Middle\nEast and Africa.\nThere will be a wider and more concrete scope\nfor cooperation within two years when the European\nUnion achieves its military capability. At present, it is\ndifficult to say what kind of operations the European\n24\n\nUnion could or would execute and when it could do so.\nIn Finland\u2019s case, our law requires that either the\nUnited Nations or the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe mandate such an operation.\nIn today\u2019s complex crises civilian aspects of crisis\nmanagement have and will become all the more\nrelevant in all organizations. The European Union has\ndeveloped its civilian capabilities in four priority areas,\nnamely civilian police, strengthening the rule of law,\nstrengthening civilian administration and civil\nprotection. In these areas, the European Union and the\nUnited Nations, as well as other international\norganizations, must also seek synergies and\ncomplementarity.\nThe Millennium Summit and the Millennium\nDeclaration are outstanding achievements in the history\nof the United Nations. The Declaration manifests a\nunique commitment to multilateralism by all the\nMember States of the United Nations. It sets an\nambitious agenda and goals for the United Nations for\nyears to come. However, without effective\nimplementation it is only a piece of paper. Its\nimplementation also requires common action and\nstrengthened commitment to multilateralism. The\nSecretary-General\u2019s road map gives us guidance on\nhow to maintain the millennium momentum and how to\nproceed, although the onus is on the Member States.\nThis year alone the United Nations has organized\nfive conferences and special sessions and hundreds of\nother meetings that are an integral part of the follow-up\nand implementation of the Millennium Declaration.\nThese processes should show the same kind of\ncommitment as was encountered in the Summit.\nUnfortunately, I have to say that none of these recent\nconferences and special sessions has come close to\nreflecting the commitment that was so noticeable in the\nMillennium Summit. We need invigorated common\nefforts to genuinely implement the ambitious agenda\nadopted only a year ago and to uphold multilateralism.\nI hope we can see improvement in this respect in\ncoming summits and conferences.\nThe moral and political commitment to the\nDeclaration should lead to its effective implementation.\nThe strong support for these common objectives and\nour determination to achieve them need much more\naction in order to become a reality. Such challenges as\nhalving, by the year 2015, the proportion of people\nliving in poverty should not be jeopardized by narrow\nnational interests.\nGlobalization and harnessing it to benefit all\nhumankind remain one of the major challenges to the\ninternational community. A common approach is\nneeded in this work too. We have to learn how to deal\nwith the paradox of democracy spreading across the\nworld, and there is much disillusionment about its\nworkings. The key to explaining this paradox is\nglobalization. It poses a demand to develop strong,\nnew, democratic policies and institutions for\ninternational and global governance. They must be\ndeveloped in the United Nations, but also at the\nregional level, such as in the European Union.\nThe Government of Finland recently prepared a\nstudy on Finnish policies on globalization. One of its\nmain conclusions was that in resolving multinational\ncrises created by globalization, the role of cooperation\nbetween national Governments will be growing, not\ndiminishing. The United Nations is the most universal\nforum for intergovernmental cooperation. Finland\nsupports the United Nations as one of the central actors\nin harnessing globalization at the universal level.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "In the name of Allah, most compassionate, most merciful.\nBlessing and peace be upon the most noble of prophets.\n \nMr. President:\nIt gives me great pleasure to extend to you and to your friendly country, the Republic of Korea, our sincere congratulations on your election as President of this General Assembly, expressing full confidence that you will steer the business of this important session competently and effectively.\n\n  \nI would also like to express our gratitude to the President of the previous session of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri, who managed its business with wisdom and expertise, in a way that deserves our thanks and appreciation.\nIt is also my pleasure on this occasion to greet His Excellency the Secretary-General and extend my thanks and appreciation for his continued efforts to establish peace and security in the world, maintain the role of the Organization and raise its efficiency in order to restore credibility and effectiveness.\nMr. President:\nThe international community is still going through the aftermath of the horrendous disaster that befell the United States of America on September 11, resulting in huge material losses and the death of thousands of innocent victims:  tremendous damage that cannot yet be reckoned or determined, such was the gravity of the catastrophe, its depth and repercussions.\nAn earnest global direction has emerged, to stand resolutely and firmly against whoever is proved to be responsible for or connected with this heinous criminal act; and to attempt every way and means conducive to the eradication of the phenomenon of international terrorism that has lately been spreading and from which various nations and countries have suffered irrespective of their affiliation or ethnicity.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was one of the first states to express its absolute condemnation and strong denunciation of what happened in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Without hesitation it has contributed to any effort or alliance aimed at the eradication of this perilous scourge that threatens us all. This stance of the Kingdom is in harmony with its constant and continuing policies against terrorism and its perpetrators. The Kingdom itself has suffered from terrorism, and has taken numerous administrative, legal and security measures to combat it and eliminate it; to curb terrorist actions and practices, or at least to minimize the possibilities of their occurrence.\nMr. President:\nOur meeting during this session, convened just two months after the New York disaster, and a few miles from ground zero, must take us from the phase of shock and sorrow at what happened to the phase of earnest action and the adoption of practical and effective means for combating terrorism: to sever its roots and causes. It is therefore most fitting to take up the spirit expressed by His Excellency President George W. Bush in his address to this distinguished forum a few days ago, in which he stressed that the time is ripe to move together seriously and purposefully in confronting this joint enemy, and not be satisfied merely with denunciation, repudiation, and the expression of sorrow.\nOn our part, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, even prior to the September incident, had in fact taken a series of measures and regulations that prove our seriousness in anti-terrorism endeavors. For example, my country enacted a series of laws and regulations related to combating terrorism and inflicting harsh punishment on its perpetrators. It has adopted financial and banking measures that restrict the potential for extremist groups to benefit from means of financial support to facilitate implementation of their plans.\nAt the regional level the Kingdom was one of the first signatories to the Arab Convention for Combating Terrorism issued in 1998 by the League of Arab States, as well as the Convention on Combating Terrorism of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. At the international level, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has acceded to numerous UN agreements concerning terrorism. It is on the point of joining two agreements: the International Convention on Terrorist Bombings, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\nMr. President:\nThere is a fact that should not be overlooked concerning the growing global concern on the issue of terrorism, in the context of crystallizing policies and adopting international agreements designed to combat it. The mere enactment of laws and regulations to combat terrorism, while essential, is not enough by itself to prevent incidents of terrorist action.\nEradication of terrorism requires all of us to move towards eliminating the infrastructure that is relied on by terrorist groups scattered all over the world, the infrastructure that is providing them the means of support and publicity. In this context we should remember that certain countries grant privileges and immunities to those who resort to them under cover of \\\"political opposition\\\", with the result that they are able to avail themselves of freedom of movement in any country that hosts them, exploiting its laws and spreading their propaganda, making contacts and sending hate messages, attempting to influence public opinion and instigate the performance of violent and terrorist activities within that country. If we are serious in fighting terrorism, we must close this door in the face of anyone who wishes to exploit a country to achieve an end that may seem legitimate for some but in reality is a path leading to violence and terrorism that has no relation to a just cause.\nThe other issue that we should understand and pay attention to, particularly in light of the feelings generated by the events in New York and Washington, is the necessity to be aware that if the process of combating terrorism takes the form of accusing particular nationalities or religious groups, and is motivated by prejudice and bias, from an angle of generalization devoid of rationale or firm evidence, then this haste in accusation and spreading unfounded allegations such as linking terrorism and terrorists to Islam, will benefit only those who aim at propagating the idea of a clash of civilizations, which we believe is the basic objective of those who committed the events of September. Following such confrontational trends will result only in contributing to the achievement of the aims of the terrorists themselves.\nWe look forward to the United Nations, as the body that represents all of us without exception, to make the international endeavors against terrorism sincere global efforts devoid of discrimination and bias, and for the service of all members of the international community, protecting them from the evil of terrorism, including official terrorism that is supported by states.\nWithin the framework of its endeavors to combat terrorism, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has supported all efforts that stem from our international Organization, whether acceding to international agreements as mentioned earlier, or through endorsing the relevant resolutions on this topic, including Security Council Resolutions 1368 and 1373 (2001).\nMy country supports the call for convening an international conference on terrorism to be held under the auspices of the United Nations, with one of its prime functions that of putting a specific definition to terrorism:  distinguishing terrorism as a serious phenomenon threatening the security and stability of the international community, from the right of nations to struggle and resist occupation in accordance with the provisions of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\nMr. President:\nCombating terrorism requires from all of us diligent action in order to solve unresolved issues that inflame hatred, inculcate bitterness, implant mistrust and deepen the feelings of oppression and lack of justice. When we state this matter our intention is not to link terrorism to any other issue, because we recognize very well that combating terrorism is an issue that requires our concerted effort irrespective of any other consideration. What we should pay attention to and take into consideration, however, is the necessity for not availing any opportunity to the terrorists to sneak in and exploit unresolved issues in justifying their terrorist activities, thereby linking their practices to such issues.\nIt is our duty in this case to undo any such linkage, in a positive manner that will deprive the terrorists of any justification on which to base the implementation of their plans. From this perspective, we call for acceleration of finding a just solution to the Palestinian issue, one that is not looked at as a response to the terrorists' pressures but to a pressure from our side to deprive the terrorists from exploiting the continuation of this issue that is suspended without resolution.\nThis is exactly what makes us look with full appreciation to what has been stated in the address of the President of the United States of America before the General Assembly where he indicated - in the context of his reference to this issue - that violence in Palestine is the responsibility of all parties and not one particular party, and that it is the right of both Israel and Palestine to live jointly as independent states. The peace process should not be derailed by sporadic incidents of violence. The optimal way to stop violence is in getting the peace process to its desired target through reviving it and integrating it according to its principles and grounds, based on the resolutions of international legitimacy particularly Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace.\nMr. President:\nThe war going on in Afghanistan represents one of the ramifications of the situation that the Afghan problem has reached, and that has led to an environment in which international terrorism found fertile ground in which to implement its plans and objectives.  With all our understanding of the motivation of the international coalition in launching its military campaign against the hideout of terrorism in Afghanistan, what we fear is that this campaign will be constrained by its military framework and the consequences of exposing Afghan civilians to greater suffering and displacement without achieving any acceptable objectives or outcome, and possibly exposing the future of Afghanistan to more trouble, division, and instability.\nTherefore, the Kingdom has done its best to avert Afghanistan from such a painful destiny, while contributing to the direction of the international coalition towards the path that is in harmony with the spirit of the Security Council resolutions relevant to the Afghan issue. As such, we have submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a perspective that embodies a number of ideas designed to safeguard the autonomy of Afghanistan and place it on the road leading to stability and development; and that on the other hand, will help eradicate terrorists and those collaborating with them by providing them with protection and a safe haven in Afghan territory.\nMilitary action alone cannot, in our opinion, lead to achieving the desired objective in Afghanistan, and therefore it is imperative to depend on a political perspective that assists in achieving the targets of the coalition on the one hand, and on the other, safeguards Afghanistan's stable political future.\nMr. President:\nToday the international community is most in need of joint endeavor and cooperation in order to devise solutions on which agreement comes as a result of our collective thought and the outcome of our joint action on the basis of justice and equality. It is imperative to strive to reach agreement on the parameters of international existence based on respect for human values, traditions and principles, to realize peace, stability and development, as well as to encourage the setting up of creative dialogue and positive interaction among global cultures in order to realize understanding and enhance international cooperation with the aim of achieving peace, security, stability and welfare for all nations and peoples.\nMay God's peace and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the demanding job of the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. It is a fitting recognition of Korea\u2019s role in the\ninternational community and of your extensive\nexperience and able leadership.\nI would also like to extend our congratulations to\nMr. Kofi Annan and the United Nations for the much\ndeserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize. It should\nserve as an added source of inspiration for him in his\nsecond term as Secretary-General and for all of us here.\nThe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\nruns parallel to dramatic events for the development of\nmankind. On behalf of the Government and the people\nof Georgia, I wish once again to express my sincere\ncondolences and compassion to the American people\nfor the tragic events of 11 September.\n15\n\nOminous threats we had been talking about for so\nlong have become real. Georgia, a country that over the\npast decade has suffered terribly from different\nmanifestations of terrorism, is an active participant in\nthe campaign against terror. The time is ripe for\nincreased cooperation from all States and peoples of\ngood will in this fight against terror.\nI am referring not only to cooperation in the\nmilitary field. Overcoming this evil requires close\ncooperation in development, the protection of human\nrights, eradicating poverty and in many other fields.\nToday\u2019s realities are a lesson to mankind on the\nconsequences and cost of indifference and a lack of\nattention to what is happening all around the world.\nThe United Nations is certainly a unique\nOrganization, where we, the Member States, can shape\ncommon strategies to combat many of the ills and\nproblems of the day. These strategies and action plans\nare worked into various United Nations resolutions,\ndecisions and declarations.\nThe United Nations Millennium Declaration is a\ngreat achievement in this regard. It is virtually a pledge\non the part of nations to a common fight against the\nmanifold challenges we face today. Without any further\ndelay, Georgia, its people and all the peoples of the\nworld need a clear demonstration of readiness to\nimplement the commitments made in the Declaration.\nWe are hopeful that the report of the Secretary-General,\nentitled \u201cRoad map towards the implementation of the\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration\u201d (A/56/326).\nwill become a guide for Governments around the\nworld.\nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations\nin the area of conflict settlement is crucial to the\ncreation of a new world order based on common values\nand principles. The world order of the twenty-first\ncentury is clearly incompatible with the widespread\nviolations of human rights, and this could lead to a\ndestabilization of the international system.\nThe reforms should also encompass United\nNations peacekeeping operations. Georgia supports the\nmeasures to enhance the effectiveness of United\nNations preventive mechanisms. In the same context,\nthe early deployment of peacekeeping contingents\nshould be more coherent and systematic in order to\nquell conflicts in their early stages. The launching of a\npeacekeeping operation or a change in its mandate\nrequires the consent of all sides involved. We are\ninclined to think that this approach requires revision.\nThe cause of peace should rank as a higher priority for\nthe United Nations than the consent of any side\ninvolved in the conflict.\nIn the words of the Secretary-General,\n\u201cthe international community must remain\nprepared to engage politically, and if necessary\nmilitarily, to contain menace and ultimately\nresolve conflicts that have got out of hand. This\nwill require a better functioning of the collective\nsecurity system than exists at the moment. It will\nrequire, above all, a greater willingness to\nintervene to prevent gross violations of human\nrights.\u201d\nInternal conflicts spawned by separatism are no\nless dangerous to international security than the\nconfrontations of the cold-war period or conflicts of\ninternational character. The reformed United Nations\nmust be more concrete and decisive in terms of\nemploying the compulsory measures provided for in\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\nGeorgia fully shares the view that there is a need\nto improve the United Nations rapid response system.\nWe support the timely creation of a United Nations\nrapid deployment force, whose utilization in the early\nstage of peacekeeping operations would contribute to\nthe prevention of many conflicts.\nI would like in particular to note the work of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\nother structures under the United Nations umbrella in\nGeorgia. Their assistance is many-faceted, and these\nstructures in particular are making a great contribution\nto the process of Georgia\u2019s democratic transformation.\nHowever, a new agenda for cooperation is also\nrequired.\nI wish to underscore the joint initiative of the\nUnited Nations and the International Monetary Fund\nwith regard to creating a programme for the eradication\nof poverty. Georgia is one of the most active\nparticipants in this programme. An interesting part of\nits effort is the elaboration of a programme of\nemploying internally displaced persons in small\nbusinesses. All of these processes are taking place\nunder very difficult conditions and in an environment\nof numerous problems.\nOver the past two years the perspectives of rapid\ndevelopment in Georgia have been countered by the\n16\n\nabsence of progress in the peace process in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia. It is time to put an end to the spiritual and\nphysical suffering of the people of Georgian, Abkhaz\nand other nationalities who have been forced from their\nhomes and lands by the tragedy of war. Most\nimportantly, we cannot instil hatred and enmity in the\ncoming generations. The value of peace in the region is\ntoo high to be sacrificed to the political and\ncommercial ambitions of a single group.\nThe time has come to react duly to the ethnic\ncleansing carried out in Abkhazia, Georgia. The\nseparatists, with the help of outside forces, expelled\nabout 300,000 people from their places of residence.\nThe inalienable right of people to live in their\nhomeland is still being flagrantly trampled.\nOn numerous occasions Georgia has expressed its\ndeep concern about the presence of uncontrolled\nregions within the territories of the sovereign State,\nruled by de facto separatist regimes. The\nencouragement of these regimes is totally unacceptable\nand fraught with dangerous consequences. The tragic\ndowning of a United Nations helicopter over Abkhazia,\nGeorgia, is one such heartbreaking example. I wish to\ntake this opportunity to once again express our deep\ncondolences to the families of the victims, who paid\nthe ultimate price for upholding the noble principles of\nthe United Nations.\nI would like to use this important rostrum to bring\nto the Assembly\u2019s attention the danger of large-scale\nprovocation that Georgia is facing today. I am referring\nto the violation of Georgia\u2019s airspace and the bombing\nof our territory. Such attacks have taken place before as\nwell, but, despite our protests, no adequate reaction\nwas forthcoming. Georgia views these acts as an\ninfringement of our sovereignty and an attempt by\nsome forces to subvert the peace process.\nAll of this is taking place at a time when the\nUnited States, together with the international\ncommunity, is mobilized against the most evil enemy\nof humankind: international terrorism. Georgia clearly\nvisualizes its place in this fight, and President\nShevardnadze has repeatedly expressed readiness for\ncooperation. But it is unacceptable that some States use\nthis noble cause of fighting terrorism as a disguise in\norder to reassert influence in the post-Soviet context.\nThe Government of Georgia reiterates its\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict\nin Abkhazia, Georgia. We believe that the use of force\nruns contrary to our political interests, in particular the\ninterests of our multi-ethnic population, including the\nAbkhazians. At the same time, it is becoming\nincreasingly difficult for the Government of Georgia to\ndissuade those people who have lost their faith in a\npeaceful resolution of the conflict from using other\nmeans.\nWe are offering a special programme for\nresolving the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, to all our\npolitical partners, the Security Council and the\nEuropean bodies. This programme has to be\nimplemented without delay, notwithstanding changes it\nmay undergo or substantial concessions it may require\nfrom the parties involved in order to reach agreement\nand to put the programme into action.\nFor two years the document on the distribution of\nconstitutional competencies between Tbilisi and\nSukhumi, drafted by the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, has been kept within the confines of\nthe Group of Friends of the Secretary-General on\nGeorgia. This document has to constitute the basis for\nmeaningful negotiations on the scope of autonomy for\nAbkhazia.\nThe Government of Georgia is ready to grant\nAbkhazia the widest form of autonomy practised\naround the world today. Considerable international\nsupport is needed to restore confidence between the\nparties, as indicated in the Declaration of the Yalta\nmeeting that took place with the assistance of brotherly\nUkraine.\nLet me stress again that we attach great\nimportance, and we are anxious to begin discussing,\nthe economic rehabilitation strategy for the region. We\nalso look forward to carrying out projects beneficial to\nall and to preserving the unique Abkhaz people.\nWe need working relations with Russia that are\nboth cordial and at the same time equitable. Russia is a\ncountry with which we have cultural and friendly ties\nthat are centuries old. We can only value its special\nrole as the regional leader, member of the international\nanti-terrorist coalition, permanent member of the\nSecurity Council and the facilitator of the peace\nprocess in Abkhazia, Georgia. We expect that all this\nwill be utilized in the best interests of all the people of\nGeorgia. The continuation of misunderstanding and\nconfrontation is unacceptable.\n17\n\nWe must exert every effort to put an end to the\nuse of separatist regimes by certain countries as a way\nof exerting pressure on neighbouring nations.\nWe support the dialogue among civilizations as a\nmeans of achieving better understanding between all\nthe peoples of the world. We would be honoured to\nhost a forum dedicated to this issue. As a country on\nthe crossroads between Europe and Asia, Georgia, with\nits ancient and multifaceted culture, is an appropriate\nplace for such a meeting.\nIn closing, let me stress again that it is dialogue\nand cooperation that should determine the fate of\nmankind. For that purpose we need a United Nations\nwith broad, coherent and determined capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of my\ndelegation, I should like to present our heartfelt\ncondolences to the grieving families following the\ntragic plane accident yesterday.\nLet me at the outset congratulate Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo on his unanimous election to preside over the fifty-\nsixth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nWith his wealth of experience and wisdom we have no\ndoubt that our deliberations will always be crowned\nwith success. He may rest assured that in carrying out\nthe important mandate entrusted to him, he will not\nfind the cooperation of the Gambian delegation\nwanting. On behalf of my delegation I should also like\nto pay a special tribute to his predecessor for a job well\ndone.\nAs for our indefatigable Secretary-General, I add\nmy voice to those of previous speakers in\ncongratulating him, and the United Nations, on\nwinning the Nobel Peace Prize. In addition to that, my\ndelegation commends him for his effective and\ninspiring leadership, in turning the United Nations\naround in such a way that much of the hope that was\nlost has since been restored. Mr. Secretary-General,\nyou deserve our respect and admiration.\nThe circumstances in which we are meeting this\ntime are far different from previous sessions for\nreasons well known to all of us. The terrorist attacks on\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\nSeptember took the whole world by surprise because of\ntheir cataclysmic proportions. Nothing can ever justify\nsuch barbaric acts. Unfortunately, like so many\ncountries present here today, we too were bereaved\nfollowing the attack on the World Trade Center. I\nshould like at this juncture to express profound\ngratitude to President George W. Bush for his kind\nremarks. The Government and people of the Gambia,\nas well as the families concerned, are deeply moved by\nthe President\u2019s thoughtfulness. All of this shows that\nterrorism has no boundaries and, worse still, it has no\nrespect for the sanctity of life. It is incumbent upon all\nof us therefore not to offer sanctuary to any terrorists\nor their sponsors.\nIn the Gambia, His Excellency the President\nAlhaji Dr. Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, declared three days\nof national mourning and requested all mosques and\nchurches to pray for the deceased in solidarity with the\nfriendly people of the United States and their\nGovernment. While we continue to pray and mourn,\nindividually and collectively, we in the Gambia\nsubscribe unreservedly to Security Council resolutions\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), of 12 and 28 September\n2001, respectively. Similarly, we welcome the adoption\nof the Dakar Declaration on terrorism by the\nConference of African Heads of State and Government,\nheld in Dakar, Senegal, on 17 October 2001.\nHaving said that, I would, however, hasten to\npoint out that it is one thing to adopt resolutions and\ndeclarations but it is quite another to implement them\nfully. It goes without saying that the fight against\ninternational terrorism is neither easy nor the business\nof a select group of countries alone. Certainly not. This\ninternational scourge can only be dealt with effectively\nthrough concerted international effort. However, it will\nserve no useful purpose to request Member States to\nreport on measures taken in the fight against terrorism\nwhen the requisite means to do so are not available.\nThis will be a long and difficult engagement, but at the\nsame time it is not an impossible task. In the process,\nno country should be excluded. Consequently, as a first\nstep, the Security Council should inquire of Member\nStates what they need, at the national level, to equip\nthem in the fight against terrorism, especially in terms\nof training and logistics. In our view, that is the priority\n14\n\nof priorities, because no category of countries can be\nconsidered safe unless and until all categories of\ncountries are seen to be safe.\nLet me mention en passant one very important\npoint. The Gambia, where I come from, is\npredominantly Muslim, but we do not at all subscribe\nto the misleading concept that the struggle against\nterrorism is one between Islam and Christianity. For\nthat reason we in the Gambia are committed to signing\nand ratifying all the relevant United Nations\nconventions against terrorism.\nAllow me now to dwell a little on some domestic\nissues. As was widely reported all over the world, the\npresidential elections that were held in the Gambia on\n18 October 2001 received the unanimous endorsement\nof the entire international community as free, fair and\ntransparent. All international observers present in the\ncountry expressed the same views. The 1996 elections\nwere also free, fair and transparent, but we were given\na mere pass. In the 2001 elections we passed with\nflying colours. As of right, therefore, we expect our\nprincipal partners in development, who were still\nsceptical in 1996, now to show the way forward by\nembracing the Government and people of the Gambia\nin a new spirit of solidarity geared towards a fresh and\nreinvigorated partnership. We have kept our part of the\nbargain as a nation. We have delivered what was\nexpected of us \u2014 in fact, we did more and better than\nexpected. What happened immediately after the\nelection results were announced is ample\ndemonstration of political maturity. Let me give a\ngraphic illustration of what I am talking about by\nborrowing a paragraph or two from His Excellency\nPresident Jammeh\u2019s victory statement.\n\u201cFellow Gambians, [...] I would want to\nenjoin you all after the celebrations to put the\ncampaign and all the euphoria and the differences\nand misunderstandings of politics behind us and\ncome together as one people to work with my\nGovernment, supporters and non-supporters alike,\nto further develop this country.\u201d\nPresident Jammeh then went on to thank the principal\nleaders of the opposition for their courage and maturity\ndisplayed in extending their congratulations to him in a\ntelephone conversation. The President then said:\n\u201cThe gesture was indeed most welcome and I\nwould want to restate my expectation that with\nthe elections now behind us, we would put our\ndifferences of political ideology aside and work\ntogether as members of the same family to pursue\nthe development agenda we in this country have\nset for ourselves, in the best interest of our\nbeloved people.\u201d\nThat indeed was the icing on the cake. It can now\nbe proclaimed without any fear of contradiction that\nthe Gambia, despite all the odds, is consolidating its\nposition among the leading democracies in Africa, and\nindeed in the whole world.\nElsewhere on the African continent, while we\ncannot claim that the same pattern of free and fair\nelections and the rule of law prevail, we can note with\nsatisfaction that the signs are encouraging, although a\nlot more remains to be done. In neighbouring Sierra\nLeone we commend the United Nations Mission in\nSierra Leone (UNAMSIL) for what has been achieved\nso far. As elections are fast approaching it becomes\neven more urgent to accelerate the process of\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration.\nThe importance of a regional approach to conflict\nresolution cannot be overemphasized. We will have to\nsound our own trumpet by commending the Economic\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) for the\npreponderant role that it has played in the quest for a\nlasting solution to the problems in the Mano River\narea. With regard to another neighbouring country,\nGuinea-Bissau, the Gambia, in its capacity as\ncoordinator of the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau,\nwould like to launch an appeal to the donor community\nto cooperate closely with the Group with a view to\nconvening the long overdue round-table donors\u2019\nconference. As stated in the Fall report following a\nmission to West Africa some time ago, certain\ncountries in transition, such as Guinea-Bissau, need\nspecial and urgent attention. I am referring to the\nimportant report by Assistant Secretary-General\nIbrahima Fall. We are not done with that report yet, for\nit raises such serious issues as the regional approach to\nconflict resolution.\nWe are also following very closely the situation\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\ngratifying to note that the Security Council adopted\nresolution 1376 (2001) by which it gave the green light\nfor the launching of phase III of the deployment of the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\n15\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). My\ndelegation also encourages the parties concerned to\npursue the inter-Congolese dialogue with renewed\nvigour and to cooperate with the Facilitator. We are\nsaddened, however, by the illegal exploitation of\nnatural resources and other forms of wealth in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. There is obviously\na direct link between such practices and the\nprolongation of the conflict. Still, in the Great Lakes\nregion, we pay a special tribute to former President\nMandela for his laudable efforts to bring peace to\nBurundi. Concerning the situation in Angola, my\ndelegation continues to believe that UNITA\u2019s ability to\nwage war must be further reduced through tighter\nsanctions. In this context we note with satisfaction the\nextension of the mandate of the Monitoring\nMechanism.\nTurning to other parts of the continent, my\ndelegation welcomes the decision of the Security\nCouncil to terminate the sanctions that were imposed\non the Sudan. We are also calling on the Council to\nmake a bold move and lift the sanctions imposed on\nLibya. The international community demanded that the\nLibyan authorities hand over the Lockerbie suspects for\ntrial in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The\ninternational community must now honour its\nobligations and stop moving the goal-posts.\nOutside Africa we also continue to express\nconcern about a number of conflict situations.\nSeemingly, the most intractable of the lot is the\nsituation in the Middle East, and, notably, the\nPalestinian problem. There can be no lasting peace in\nthe Middle East without resolving the Palestinian\nquestion. We in the Gambia have always held the view\nthat, while recognizing the right of Israel to exist\nwithin secure borders, we also believe that the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict\nshould be implemented, culminating in the creation of\nan independent Palestinian state.\nIn the situation between Kuwait and Iraq, we in\nthe Gambia have always maintained that the\ninternational community should, as a matter of\nurgency, find ways of alleviating the suffering of the\nIraqi people. But at the same time, the Iraqi leadership\nmust be accountable for the Kuwaiti prisoners of war\nand missing persons. The families of the prisoners of\nwar and missing persons have also been suffering for\ntoo long and, therefore, we call upon the Iraqi\nGovernment to respect and comply with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions in order to achieve peace\nand stability in the Gulf region.\nIt is an irony that long after the end of the cold\nwar, the situation in the Korean peninsula remains\nbasically the same. We in the Gambia were, however,\nvery much encouraged by the visit to North Korea of\nPresident Kim Dae Jung of South Korea in June last\nyear. It is only through dialogue and the exchange of\nsuch high-level visits that the peaceful unification of\nthe Korean peninsula will be achieved.\nSimilarly, it is our fervent hope that one day the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China will unite but, as the saying goes, let\nus put first things first. As clearly stated by my\ndelegation during the meeting of the General\nCommittee, the Government of the Gambia would like\nto reiterate that the exceptional situation of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan needs to be reconsidered\nby this body. Only a few days ago, the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO). That is no mean achievement\nand, therefore, my delegation would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate the Government and the 23\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We\nin the Gambia have no doubt that they will make\nconstructive contributions to the work of the WTO. It\nwill be recalled that the Republic of China on Taiwan\nis now the world\u2019s seventeenth largest economy in\nterms of gross national product (GNP) and the fifteenth\nmost important trading nation. Considering that the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan possesses the world\u2019s\nthird largest foreign reserves, in addition to its strategic\nposition as the sixteenth largest foreign direct investor,\nit does not make much sense to continue to exclude it\nfrom the United Nations. Politics aside, the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan has a lot to offer the international\ncommunity. For instance, in the crucial area of\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT),\nthe real revolution of our times, the Republic of China\non Taiwan is in the vanguard. We all know that the\nissue of ICT is among the top priorities of the United\nNations and we therefore look forward to the special\nevent on Tuesday, 20 November, when the Secretary-\nGeneral will launch the United Nations Information\nand Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force.\nHow will we be able to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan when it is excluded\nfrom the work of the United Nations?\n16\n\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan is active in\nother important areas as well, especially development\ncooperation, by providing experts and through\ninternational financial institutions, and, likewise, in the\nhumanitarian field by providing disaster relief to\ncountries in need. The case of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan is unique. It is exceptional and should be\ntreated as such, quite apart from observing the\nprinciple of universality.\nAnother country which has much to offer the\ninternational community is Cuba, ranging from\nmedicine to sports. After more than three decades, the\nsanctions imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. These\nsanctions can no longer be justified; in fact, they are\ncounterproductive.\nPrior to the tragic events of 11 September, we had\nalready identified a number of areas for increased\ninternational cooperation within the framework of the\nMillennium Declaration. Foremost among these is the\neradication of poverty. It is made a priority of priorities\nin the Millennium Declaration, if not the priority. In the\nWorld Development Report 2000-2001 entitled\n\u201cAttacking poverty\u201d, the President of the World Bank\nin his foreword stated that \u201cPoverty amid plenty is the\nworld\u2019s greatest challenge.\u201d We are also of the view\nthat poverty constitutes a serious threat to international\npeace and security, knowing that 1.2 billion people live\non less than $1 a day. That is why our leaders\nundertook to cut by half the proportion of people living\nin extreme poverty by the year 2015. Of the 1.2 billion\nwho live on less than $1 a day, 300 million are in\nAfrica. Under these circumstances the New African\nInitiative is indeed a timely response. We only hope\nthat unlike previous blueprints for Africa\u2019s socio-\neconomic development, the New Initiative will not be\nleft to gather dust. It would appear for the first time,\nthat we, the Africans, are in the driver\u2019s seat. That is a\nclear demonstration of ownership and commitment.\nOur principal partners in development should also\ncomplement our efforts by providing the necessary\nresources as a matter of urgency. The Economic\nCommission for Africa should work closely with the\nvarious regional economic groupings to ensure proper\nand effective coordination. We are confident that the\nmomentum generated by the adoption of the New\nAfrican Initiative will be intensified with the\nconvening of the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development at the summit level in\nMonterrey, Mexico, next year. That Conference will\nprovide a unique opportunity for the international\ncommunity to translate into reality the global solidarity\nspelled out in the Millennium Declaration, especially in\nsuch vital areas as official development assistance\n(ODA), foreign direct investment (FDI) and debt\nreduction, or outright cancellation in some cases, and\nmarket access \u2014 to mention only a few.\nSimilarly, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment (Rio+10), to be held in South Africa next\nyear, will also provide a golden opportunity for\nstocktaking, notably for a comprehensive review of the\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\nAll efforts geared towards the eradication of\npoverty would be incomplete without addressing the\nissue of food security. My delegation therefore looks\nforward to the convening of the World Food Summit in\nJune next year. A related issue is health. We in West\nAfrica, particularly we in the Gambia, would like to\neradicate malaria as a matter of urgency and, as a first\nstep, our leaders have adopted the Rollback Malaria\nProgramme. We will need the support and solidarity of\nthe entire international community in this endeavour,\nespecially within the context of the Global Alliance for\nVaccines and Immunization.\nWith special reference to the least developed\ncountries, it will be recalled that the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\nheld recently, adopted yet another Programme of\nAction for the decade 2001-2010 aimed essentially at\nthe eradication of poverty. We hope that the rest of the\ndonor community will support that Programme fully by\nmaking available the resources necessary for its\nimplementation. In any poverty eradication\nprogramme, the most vulnerable groups, that is, women\nand children, should be given special attention. That is\nwhy the Government of the Gambia remains committed\nto the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,\nincluding the further actions and initiatives that\nemanated from the Beijing+5 Conference held last\nJune. The same applies to the Nairobi forward-looking\nstrategies for the advancement of women and all other\ninitiatives that promote the advancement of women and\nthe girl child. In fact, His Excellency President Yahya\nJammeh has now decided that all girls in the Gambia\nfrom grades 1 to 12, in virtually all parts of the\ncountry, will no longer pay school fees.\nFinally, experience has shown that our collective\nsecurity can only be guaranteed if and when all\n17\n\nmembers of the comity of nations are equally\nguaranteed freedom from want and freedom from fear.\nThat can be achieved only through genuine\ninternational solidarity. The tendency to look the other\nway when another needs a helping hand should be a\nthing of the past. Each time in our history when we are\nfaced with major difficulties, we suddenly realize how\nmuch we need one another. We close our ranks and\ntake up the challenges together. We are again at a\ncrossroads. That is why we are all here to renew faith\nin multilateralism. There is no alternative to the United\nNations. We are now strengthened in our conviction\nthat our Organization is nowhere near being a \u201csunset\u201d\nOrganization. It is a \u201csunrise\u201d Organization. But it\nshould shine even brighter once the Security Council is\nreformed to reflect the realities of the twenty-first\ncentury. Unless that is done, the Security Council runs\nthe serious risk of becoming irrelevant because it is\nanchored in the past. We do not want that to happen. It\nis too vital an organ to be sidelined, but it must adapt\nand adjust. It is time to move on. Let us be forward-\nlooking. Whatever the outcome may be, Africa must be\nadequately represented.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\npreside over the General Assembly at this session and\nwish you every success in fulfilling your mandate. Our\nappreciation also goes to Mr. Harri Holkeri for his\nwork at the last session.\nWe wish to convey to our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, our sincerest congratulations on his\nunanimous re-election for a second term as leader of\nthis Organization in a broad acknowledgement of his\nabilities, leadership and firm resolve to promote the\npurposes and principles of the Charter, which have\nbeen rightly recognized with the awarding to him and\nthe United Nations of the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe delegation of El Salvador believes that the\ndeplorable and irrational terrorist attacks on the people\nand Government of the United States, which we\nrepudiated and condemned at the time and do so again\nin this forum, have made it plain that terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations is a grave threat to peace,\nfreedom and democracy. Given the special nature of\nthat scourge, it is essential that we unite our wills and\npool our efforts to combat and eradicate it.\nThese acts of terrorism have affected us all\ndirectly, because they represent an assault on\ncivilization, which is based on the values and\nprinciples embodied in the Charter of the Organization.\nIndeed, such acts affect not only international peace\nand security, but also the growth and development of\nour economies. In view of all this, the countries\nrepresented here should not allow minority groups to\ncrush our peoples\u2019 democratic spirit or to sow\npermanent uncertainty and fear by means of violence\nand threats directed against the most fundamental\nprinciples of human coexistence.\nIt is precisely the norms of human coexistence\nthat underpin and sustain peace, freedom and\ndevelopment for humanity, regardless of ideology,\nculture, race or religion. We concur with many\ndelegations that the struggle against terrorism should\n4\n\nnot be considered, much less interpreted, as a struggle\namong civilizations or nations.\nPursuant to the decisions taken by the\ninternational community, the Government of El\nSalvador is taking the proper steps to fulfil the\nprovisions articulated in the pertinent resolutions of the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and other\nmeasures decided upon at the regional and continental\nlevel. It is appropriate to mention that at the Central\nAmerican level, the Security Commission has adopted\nan ambitious programme of action so that we can work\ntogether to combat terrorism.\nWith respect to our national situation, on a\nnumber of occasions we have reiterated the\ncommitment and political resolve of the Government of\nEl Salvador to tackle effectively the challenges of\nbuilding sustainable human development. We have\nmade much progress in the last decade.\nHowever, as everyone knows, this year began\nwith serious natural disasters. The two earthquakes in\nJanuary and February shook the very foundations of\nSalvadoran society, since 25 per cent of the population\nwas affected, and losses amounted to 13 per cent of the\ngross domestic product. The devastating effects of the\nearthquakes extended into the economic and social\nspheres, obliging us to implement an emergency\nprogramme, which meant changing and adapting the\nGovernment\u2019s plan to match the new priorities,\nredirecting the State\u2019s limited financial resources to\nreconstruction. This was compounded by an\nunprecedented drop in international coffee prices, our\nmajor export commodity. We also suffered a\nwidespread drought, affecting agricultural production,\nwhich is the unpinning of our economy.\nThus we believe that it is essential to reiterate our\nspecial recognition of and gratitude to all the countries\nand international organizations that provided us with\nvaluable assistance during these natural disasters. I\nwish to thank in particular the World Food Programme\nfor its effective work in relieving the food-supply\nproblems of large sectors of the population affected by\nthe drought.\nIt is of the utmost importance to the Government\nof El Salvador to refer on this occasion to something\nthat has marked a turning point in the history of our\nnation and which, at the same time, represents a\nsuccess for United Nations peacekeeping operations:\nthe first multidisciplinary mission to resolve an internal\nconflict, as was the case in El Salvador.\nI wish to highlight, with great satisfaction, that 16\nJanuary 2002 will mark 10 years since the historic\nsigning of the El Salvador Peace Agreements, which\nformally ended the armed conflict that had wreaked\nhavoc in our society for 12 years. The Secretary-\nGeneral participated actively and played an important\nrole as intermediary in the process of negotiation and\nin the verification of the parties\u2019 compliance with all\nthe commitments they had undertaken.\nSince that date, we have engaged in a process that\nwe can divide into two phases \u2014 first, the transition\nfrom war to peace, and second, the transition from\npeace to democracy. During the process we have made\ngreat efforts to fulfil the commitments of the\nAgreements in order to achieve peace, democracy,\nrespect for and protection of human rights, national\nreconciliation and reunification of Salvadoran society,\nand we have achieved qualitative changes in these\nareas.\nThe Government of El Salvador, as a signatory\nparty deeply interested in faithful observance of the\nAgreements, has been gratified to see the success\nachieved in executing these undertakings, putting into\npractice a constructive policy that has enabled us to\ndeal with sensitive and complex issues. The members\nof the international community, especially the donor\ncountries and the United Nations, can attest to this.\nIn fulfilling the Peace Agreements, all\nSalvadorans shouldered the obligations with the\nseriousness and responsibility that were required,\nmindful of the solemn significance and the implications\nof such fulfilment for the aspirations and expectations\nthat the Agreement outlined, both domestic and vis-\u00e0-\nvis the international community. This is why we are\nvery pleased that in fulfilling our obligations we have\nnot betrayed the trust of those that showed us solidarity\nand supported us throughout the process.\nNow more than ever, new possibilities are\nopening up for all sectors of the country \u2014 with a\nvision of being a nation \u2014 to face the future with a\nsense of shared responsibility, and for us to undertake\nthe new challenges involved in continuing to bolster\ndemocracy and promoting economic and social\ndevelopment. Consequently, we are committed to the\nprocess of modernizing and strengthening democratic\ninstitutions in conformity with the strategy of\n5\n\nsustainable development, whose focus and destiny are\nto improve the quality of life of each and every\nSalvadoran.\nIn a globalized and interdependent world, any\nsituation that affects the economy of the industrialized\ncountries and those with emerging economies has a\nsignificant impact on the conditions in the remainder of\nthe countries of the international community. The trend\ntowards a slowdown in these economies becomes\ndisquieting for our countries because of its adverse\neffects on fostering economic progress and maintaining\nsocial stability.\nIn this regard, it is essential to pay attention to the\nproblems besetting the international economic order\nand prevent them from spreading and becoming causes\nthat generate fresh conflict, especially in the\ndeveloping countries. For this reason, we hope that the\noutcome of the meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization in Doha will be beneficial for the\ndeveloping countries.\nIt is appropriate to note that during the\nparticipation of the President of El Salvador, Francisco\nFlores, in the Group of Eight Summit in Genoa, Italy,\non 10 June, he voiced the anxiety and concerns that we\nfeel about the serious problems that exist and stated our\naspirations as developing countries to promote the\nprogress of our peoples. On that occasion, President\nFlores noted that we do not want handouts or\nconcessions based on paternalistic approaches. We\nwant to become partners in development and achieve\nmutual benefits so that we have the opportunity to\ngradually improve our conditions and have better\naccess to and derive greater benefit from international\nmarkets.\nIn El Salvador, we have put into practice a\nnumber of measures concerning the free market and\npromotion of foreign investment. They have led to\ninternationally recognized economic openness, which\nin practice has included a process of privatization,\nespecially in the communications, energy and finance\nsectors and in the area of social security, enhancing our\npotential for growth and development.\nAt the beginning of this year, as part of a gradual\nprocess that will lead finally to the elimination of the\nnational currency, the Government of El Salvador\nenacted the Monetary Integration Act, establishing the\ndollar as the unit of account in the financial system.\nThis will facilitate our trading and financial integration\nand further improve conditions for national and foreign\ninvestment and access to international financial\nsources.\nIn the area of trade, in addition to having a free-\ntrade relationship with our fraternal Central American\ncountries, we have extended our ties with Mexico, the\nDominican Republic and Chile, establishing free-trade\ntreaties with them, while others are in the process of\nbeing negotiated with Panama and Canada.\nAt the same time, we are making an effort to\nstrengthen the process of the Central American\nIntegration System (SICA), where we have taken\nsignificant steps, including customs activities and a\nregional proposal to modernize and transform Central\nAmerica. The proposal\u2019s strategic projects for\ndevelopment were presented this year to the\nConsultative Group in Madrid. The implementation of\nthe Puebla-Panama Plan, in which Central America is\npartnered with Mexico for its development, is part of\nthese efforts.\nIn general, we can say that, given the trend\ntowards globalization, which marks modern\ninternational relations, and despite the difficulties and\ncomplexities involved, our country is doing its utmost\nto take advantage of the phenomenon. In this regard,\nthe least that we can hope is that there will be good\nwill and political resolve on the part of the developed\ncountries to grant us solidarity and support to enable us\nto become effectively incorporated in the process.\nIn view of the importance of the commitment\nassumed by the heads of State and Government in the\nMillennium Declaration of the United Nations, we note\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico, and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development will provide\nopportunities to demonstrate the solidarity and\ncooperation of the international community,\nparticularly on the part of the developed countries, by\nthe adoption of appropriate measures conducive to\nachieving fair and equitable development, especially in\nthe developing countries.\nWith respect to other sensitive issues for the\ninternational community, the Government of El\nSalvador views with concern the continuation or\nworsening of certain problems that, if not resolved,\nwill be a threat to international peace and security.\nThese include the ongoing conflict in the Middle East,\nwhich is a source of great concern, especially because\n6\n\nduring the past year we have seen unremitting violence,\nleading to the irreparable loss of human life and\nmaterial and economic damage in the region, and to a\nconstant increase in the suffering of the Israeli and\nPalestinian peoples.\nIn that context, the Government of El Salvador\nreiterates its support for all efforts and measures aimed\nat achieving a negotiated political solution that takes\ninto account the interests of the parties directly\ninvolved, in order to achieve a firm and lasting peace.\nThe State of Israel\u2019s right to exist and to live within\nsecure borders, as well as the inalienable right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to\nestablish its own State, are basic preconditions for\nachieving peace, which will enable the leaders of the\nregion to devote themselves to promoting the progress\nand well-being of their peoples.\nThe extraordinary situation of the Republic of\nChina in Taiwan is a case that the international\ncommunity should examine, particularly in the light of\nthe most recent changes in the international system.\nRegarding the strengthening of the world\nOrganization, it is important that this opportunity not\nbe lost to address an item of priority interest for all\nMember States: Security Council reform. In this\nregard, we must emphasize the commitments contained\nin the Millennium Declaration so that this reform can\nbe carried out. In that regard, we urge the Open-ended\nWorking Group established for this purpose to redouble\nits efforts so that those commitments will be fulfilled\nand so that we can achieve, on the basis of flexible\npositions, a general agreement on the issue.\nFinally, given the complex and uncertain\ninternational situation, we urge all Governments,\ngroups and sectors of civil society to reflect on the\nimperative importance of working together in a spirit\nof human solidarity that will enable us to overcome all\ndifferences that separate us in order to achieve great\nglobal objectives that could not be achieved on an\nindividual basis, with a view to attaining the spiritual\nand physical peace to which all nations aspire.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, on behalf of the Government of Colombia,\nto express our satisfaction at your assumption of the\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly.\nYour experience and leadership are valuable credentials\nfor bringing our deliberations to a fruitful result. I wish\nalso to pay tribute to your predecessor, the Minister of\nForeign Affairs of Finland, His Excellency Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, whose diplomatic skills contributed decisively\nto the Assembly\u2019s work.\nI want, further, to speak of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose authority, dedication and\n5\n\nmeaningful contribution will serve as inspiration for\nthe decisions that Member States must take at this\nsession.\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate our\nsatisfaction at the honour accorded to the United\nNations and to the Secretary-General through the\naward of the Nobel Peace Prize. That was a well-\ndeserved tribute to our Organization, to the values\nshared by its Member States, and, in particular, to the\nSecretary General, whose personal commitment and\nvisionary approach have given new life to the United\nNations and have helped to consolidate its international\ncredibility. That decision was more than an\nacknowledgement of past achievements; it provided\nencouragement that inspires the work of the United\nNations in the light of the challenges of the new\nmillennium.\nTwo months ago the entire world was shaken by a\nseries of unprecedented terrorist acts. We have all\nspoken of the dreadful effects of these attacks. We have\nall expressed our solidarity to the people of the United\nStates. And we all agree that those irrational acts not\nonly affected one single country but were in fact an\nattack against all mankind. But we must go even\nfurther; we must understand why such events occurred\nand what we must do to ensure that similar acts never\nhappen again \u2013 never again.\nThe tragedy of 11 September had the positive\neffect of uniting us all against a common enemy:\nterrorism. And it did something else: it removed the\ndissembling from our words; it stripped the hypocrisy\nfrom our discourse; it moved us out of the world of\ngrey tones to which we were so accustomed. Now we\nmust work to replace it with a black-and-white world\nthat is free of ambiguity.\nAnd what were those greys that are so evident\ntoday? They were the ambiguities we all expressed in\nrespect of violence and the money that finances it. In\nthe past, when an act against civilians anywhere in the\nworld suited our interests, we would speak of a\nhumanitarian crisis, of defending democracy, of\nreasons of State. And we continued on impassively,\nwith a clear conscience. But when an act against\ncivilians anywhere did not suit our interests, we would\ntake a firm stand, we would react with indignation and\nwe would speak of terrorism, of attacks against\nmankind, of treacherous attacks against democracy and\nhuman rights.\nLet there be no more ambiguity or equivocation.\nThe time has come to define our position, with no\nvague half answers: either we side with mankind, its\ndignity and its integrity, or we do not.\nWhenever human dignity or civilians are\nattacked, that is an act of terrorism. It does not matter\nwhether it is perpetrated by a group of religious\nfanatics or by an organization claiming to have\npolitical ideals. There is no pretext for attacking\ndefenceless civilians. The dividing line is very clear:\neither we respect human life and dignity or we stand\nagainst humankind.\nThe horrendous acts of 11 September do not\nrepresent a collision of civilizations, religions or\ncultures. The only collision is between a violent\nfanatical minority on the one hand, and all forms of\ncivilization on the other. We cannot accept any further\nattempts to justify violence. No matter how much it\ncosts us \u2014 even if it goes against our present\ninterests \u2014 there is something far more valuable than\nanything else in the world: human life and human\ndignity.\nToday, we must all stand together and\nunreservedly condemn all acts of violence against any\nhuman being, regardless of the pretext. If we do not\ncast our lot in favour of mankind and human values,\nwhat will be left for us? What right will we have to call\nourselves the leaders of a civilization gone adrift?\nI address the Assembly today with the\noverwhelming responsibility and authority vested in me\nas President of a country, Colombia, that for decades\nhas endured an internal conflict where every new day\nbrings more deaths and kidnappings because of the\nintransigence of illegal groups seeking to impose\nthemselves at the cost of the lives of their compatriots.\nAnd I address the Assembly today representing a\ncountry, Colombia, that has been the main victim of\nworldwide drug addiction, a country that has suffered\ntoo many deaths, that has sacrificed natural and\nfinancial resources to combat a crime that is not its\nown. It is a global crime whose vast illegal proceeds\nremain outside our borders.\nIn those two capacities, I address the international\ncommunity, represented in the General Assembly, to\ndemand, head held high, that we move from rhetoric to\naction. The world is distressed by this ominous\nterrorism. I say candidly that we ourselves have also\n6\n\nsuffered from such terrorism for quite some time. But\nwe have not always felt the pulse of the international\ncommunity beating firmly by our side.\nWe all know that the world market for illegal\ndrugs is the number-one source of financing for\nworldwide terrorism and death. Yet the international\ncommunity has been content simply to suggest or\ndemand that production centres control drug trafficking\nthrough law enforcement and through eradication and\ninterdiction action, forgetting that this scourge is much\nmore than just a problem of cultivation and trafficking.\nIt is a global problem with global ramifications.\nColombia has always said, and my Government\nhas repeated again and again in every possible\ninternational forum, that it is necessary to control\nillegal drug production, but that we cannot forget that\nthis is a very complex transnational business and that\nthe vast proceeds of narcotics trafficking do not stay in\nour country. No, indeed: those profits move freely\nthrough international financial markets where\nseemingly respectable financiers and businessmen\nprosper, enjoying the tolerance of the entire world.\nWe must also learn from our misfortunes \u2014\nespecially from our misfortunes \u2014 and we have\nlearned something from the events of 11 September.\nWe have learned that lax control of financial\ninstitutions and the existence of tax and banking\nhavens are like giving criminals a letter of marque to\nmake and multiply their profits, to amass the fortunes\nthat finance death.\nThe shared responsibility that my country\ndemands in the fight against illegal drugs must also be\napplied to the fight against terrorism. This new\ninternational conviction that we have all been late in\nimplementing \u2014 perhaps because we are still numbed\nby the so-called post-cold-war era \u2014 must be\ntranslated into acts that go beyond rhetoric. There must\nbe no more coexisting with money laundering, even if\nit means going after the major financial conglomerates\nof the world.\nThere must be no more uncontrolled production\nand sale of the chemical precursors used in illicit drug\nproduction.\nThere must be no more illegal or uncontrolled\nmanufacturing and sale of the weapons that propagate\ndeath.\nOnly if we, beginning with the developed\ncountries, translate those principles into reality, with\nconcrete action and with political will, will we give\nmeaning and effectiveness to the fight that my country,\nColombia, has been waging for many years against the\ncultivation and production of drugs.\nNo country is free from the destructive\nconsequences of illegal drugs. There are no epicentres\nin this illegal business. This criminal activity is global\nin nature. The drug problem, and organized crime in\ngeneral, undermine the institutional framework,\nconspire against democracy, compromise governance\nand sow death and violence. They are a hothouse of\ncorruption; they erode judicial systems and they thwart\nthe rule of law. Shared responsibility, therefore, means\nthe responsibility to defend democracy, our principles\nand institutions.\nThe year 2003 will mark five years since the\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly, the\nso-called world drug summit. We should now begin to\npromote an in-depth review of all the accomplishments,\nthe obstacles encountered along the way, the new\nchallenges to be faced and the additional action we\nmust take to break, once and for all, the links that\nsupport this global phenomenon.\nBut we must do so without losing ourselves in\ngrey tones. The commitment of the international\ncommunity must be real and concrete so that we can at\nlast attack the finances of the traffickers of death. Let\nus combat the business in which they make all their\nprofits.\nFortunately, the Security Council has taken\nimportant decisions in this regard, moving the fight\nagainst crime in the right direction. Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) and the measures being taken\nby all the Governments of the world to combat the\nfinancing of international terrorism are an essential\nstep forward that Colombia supports without hesitation.\nWe must work together to dismantle the structure\nof the extremists\u2019 financial support. That is the only\nway to create a safer world for our children. It is the\nonly way to defeat the plague of violence and terrorism\nat its roots: the transnational empires of drugs.\nA year ago, we gathered in this same Hall on the\noccasion of the Millennium Summit. None of the\npriorities identified at that time was stressed as much\nas the need to ensure that globalization benefits all the\n7\n\npeoples of the world. The reality of globalization is one\nof inequality; it has led to dissatisfaction and conflict.\nWe need, through deep reflection, to become aware of\nour responsibility for humanizing globalization and\nensuring that it reflects the interests of all countries and\nregions.\nThe Conference on Financing for Development to\nbe held early next year in Mexico is particularly\nimportant in this light. Unless we mobilize the\nnecessary financial resources and move towards a new\narchitecture ensuring a stable international financial\nsystem, the commitments and the course set out at the\nMillennium Summit will be a dead letter.\nThose same criteria must guide next year\u2019s World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.\nOn that occasion, we must consolidate a positive vision\nand devise a road map for achieving real harmony\nbetween economic growth, social development and the\npreservation of the environment.\nThis is the last time I will address the General\nAssembly as President of Colombia. Each year since\n1998, I have spoken before the Assembly about the\ncommitment of my Government and of the people of\nColombia to achieving peace, democracy and progress\nin social justice.\nMore than any other leader of my country I have\nfully devoted myself to achieving peace. I do not regret\nhaving done that, because we Colombians are tired of\nviolence, intimidation, crime and kidnappings. I hope\nthat all groups living outside the law will make the\nright choice at this crucial juncture, not only in the\nhistory of Colombia but also in the history of all\nhumankind. It is up to them to decide how they want to\nbe treated: as terrorists and drug-traffickers or as\npolitical insurgents. They must define themselves\nthrough their actions. If their actions lead them to be\ntreated as mere terrorists, then they must clearly\nunderstand \u2014 and I say this vehemently to the\nworld \u2014 that Colombia and the international\ncommunity will honour their commitments and carry\nout the measures adopted by the Security Council to\ncombat terrorism.\nHistory goes on; it does not stop. Leaders come\nand go, but peoples continue along the path laid out\nbefore them. Even today, I believe that peace is\npossible if the will to make peace exists. I still believe,\nwith the firm hope of someone who knows the values\nof his people, that the road we started on will not be\nbarren.\nDuring my mandate, the international community\nhas shown an unprecedented solidarity with the people\nof Colombia and its quest for peace. I am grateful for\nthat from the bottom of my heart.\nI must give special recognition to the Secretary\nGeneral\u2019s Special Adviser on International Assistance\nto Colombia, Jan Egeland, for his assistance, and to the\ngenerous contribution of friendly nations during the\ntalks with insurgent groups. The world has sided with\npeace in Colombia, and that is a gesture we understand\nand appreciate in its full worth.\nToday I echo the strong and determined voice of\n40 million Colombians, who are all fighting for a better\nand more dignified life, and I reaffirm before the world\na message to the international community that proposes\nand demands clarity.\nThe time for lamenting is over. It is time for\ndefinitions.\nLet us put aside the empty speeches. Let us leave\nbehind the moral double standards that measure acts\nthat suit us with one yardstick and the acts that do not\nwith another. Let us advance, united together, against\nall forms of terrorism, whatever their rationales.\nNo more ambiguity. No more justifications of\nviolence. Let us never forget that there is nothing more\nsacred, more valuable or worthier than human life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I would\nexpress to the bereaved families and to the American\npeople our sincere condolences and sympathy.\nIt has been only two months since thousands of\ninnocent persons lost their lives in the World Trade\nCenter here in New York. Today, we are seeing the\nextent to which the people here have been affected. In\nthe entire history of the United Nations, there has never\nbeen a situation like this one.\nThroughout the world, people have expressed\ntheir sincere solidarity with and commiseration for the\nvictims and their families. These horrific terrorist\nattacks struck not just Americans, but also innocent\npeople from over 80 countries, members of all the\nmajor world religions and cultures. They targeted us\nall. It must therefore be a common concern of humanity\nto prevent a recurrence of this tragedy or indeed\nsomething even worse.\nThe events of 11 September thrust a dangerous\nfuture upon the world. We now live in the terrible\nknowledge that no country in the globalized world is\ninvulnerable and that enemies within, who are\ndetermined to kill and to die, can perpetrate mass\nmurder at any time. This eerie, awful danger has at a\nstroke dramatically altered the foundations of security\npolicy as we know it. The fight against internationally\noperative terrorist networks will require new responses\nfrom the community of States. International terrorism\nis a challenge above all for politics, the military, the\npolice and the judiciary, as well as for the economy\nand \u2014 very importantly \u2014 for culture. At the dawn of\nthe twenty-first century, the issue of peace and security\nhas thus taken on an entirely new perspective.\nHumanity has rarely been as united as it was on\nthat terrible day two months ago. This unity was born\nnot only of horror and compassion, but also of the\nrealization that we can successfully counter this new\ndeadly threat only if we combine our full force and\nenergy. The day of 11 September was a defining\nmoment that altered the direction of world politics. A\nnew alliance was created. It must now be strengthened\nand developed into a genuine partnership. If this is\nachieved, 11 September could go down in history not\nonly as a horrific day for humanity, but also as the\nbeginning of a new era of cooperation and\nmultilateralism.\nWhat drives people to commit these\ninconceivable crimes and to blow up themselves and\nthousands of innocents? From where does such\nuncontrollable hatred come? How can it be curbed?\nHow can it be conquered? It is certain that in any\nattempt to develop an effective counter-strategy we\nmust, while waging the war on terrorism, analyse the\nfull range of causes and circumstances that permit such\nhatred and violence to grow.\nThe United Nations is uniquely suited to the task\nahead. It provides the forum required for the creation\n12\n\nof a universal coalition. Only it can give international\nlegitimacy to the response to terrorism. It has at its\ndisposal the instruments to manage political conflicts\nand the underlying development problems that nurture\nhatred and despair.\nA comprehensive strategy against terrorism must\nconcentrate primarily on prevention. Developing such a\nstrategy means nothing less than drafting a policy for a\ncooperative world order for the twenty-first century, a\npolicy that no longer tolerates areas characterized by a\nbreakdown of order, a policy that has as its goal a\nworld order under which all peoples can claim their\nfull and equitable share. This includes making\neconomic globalization more socially just for more\npeople and supplementing it with the political\nglobalization so urgently needed.\nThe Security Council responded to 11 September\nwith rare solidarity and, with resolutions 1368 (2001)\nand 1373 (2001), took decisions on concrete,\ninternationally binding anti-terrorism measures that\npoint the way ahead. The General Assembly, too,\nseverely condemned the terrorist attacks and called for\njoint action against international terrorism.\nThis path must now be rigorously pursued with\nthe rapid and universal ratification and implementation\nof the 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions\nand the adoption of a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism. We must endeavour anew to\nbring this project, on which we all place so much hope,\nto a successful conclusion. I therefore call upon all\nStates that have not yet approved the present\ncompromise to reconsider their position.\nThe International Criminal Court can also become\na valuable instrument in the fight against terrorism.\nUnder article 7, paragraph 1, of its statute, it will have\njurisdiction to try cases of murder \u201cwhen committed as\npart of a widespread or systematic attack directed\nagainst any civilian population\u201d. There can be no doubt\nthat the attacks on New York, Washington and\nPennsylvania fulfil this requirement. For this reason, I\nwould like to ask you all once again to ratify the Rome\nStatute as quickly as possible.\nThe attack on the World Trade Center was a\nwake-up call to the profound threat to world peace that\ncan be posed by failing States. Areas where political\nand social order has collapsed offer terrorists a safe\nhaven from which they can organize their murderous\nnetworks worldwide. The community of States urgently\nneeds to take a closer and preventive look at the\nproblem of failing States \u2014 but not just in\nAfghanistan, and not only after a catastrophe has\noccurred.\nNo conflict prevention measures have ever been\nundertaken in Afghanistan. Far from it. This has\nproved to be a fatal error. For more than 20 years, a\nhumanitarian catastrophe has been playing itself out\nbefore the eyes of the world, in which women and\nchildren, in particular, have suffered. Civil war, human\nrights violations and abject misery have also been the\nnourishing ground for the unprecedented symbiosis\nbetween the terrorists of the Al Qaeda group and the\nTaliban regime.\nFrom there the trail leads directly to the horrific\nattacks in the United States. As hard as this decision\nmay be, without the use of military means, this threat\ncannot be averted. We must not forget that the suffering\nof the people in Afghanistan is above all the work of\nthe Taliban. It was the Taliban that, long before 11\nSeptember, increasingly impeded effective\nhumanitarian relief, robbed women and girls of all their\nrights and actively supported terrorism, also with the\ngoal of destabilizing Arab and Muslim States.\nNot to react would indeed be to invite further\nterror and oppression and would be extremely\ndangerous for world peace. The dramatic nature of this\nthreat is illustrated by Osama bin Laden\u2019s statement\nthat he will not shrink from using even nuclear\nweapons. Civilian means alone are unfortunately not\nalways enough to put an end to violence and terror.\nThis was the case in the Balkans.\nIn Afghanistan, too, the root of the tragic conflict\nis profoundly political, and so the solution, too, can\nultimately only be a political one. It must come from\nwithin, must reflect the diversity of peoples in Afghan\nsociety and must be accepted by the Afghan people.\nBut a peaceful solution also requires assistance from\nthe international community. Afghanistan must not be\nleft alone with its problems yet again.\nA clear political and humanitarian perspective for\nAfghanistan is now crucial. The United Nations should\nbe the coordinating agency for all peace efforts. It is\nindispensable as the framework for the political\nprocess and as the guarantor of internal agreements\nwithin Afghanistan. Only a peace process under the\nauspices of the United Nations will succeed in\nexcluding external involvement in the future and\n13\n\nensuring a peaceful future for the country in harmony\nwith its neighbours. Germany and the European Union\nare willing to play their part towards a political\nsolution for Afghanistan and to participate in the long\nterm in the economic and social reconstruction of\nAfghanistan.\nMore than anything, the refugees and the civilian\npopulation must be helped. We cannot tolerate the fact\nthat the Taliban is hindering humanitarian access and is\nusing the civilian population as a shield. Especially\nbecause of the approaching winter, we must do\neverything in our power to provide the people with at\nleast the most basic necessities and to alleviate their\ndespair and hardship. Is it possible to establish\nhumanitarian protected areas, to use the expulsion of\nthe Taliban from Mazar-e-Sharif and other towns to\nimprove the humanitarian situation, and to make a\ntown like Kabul an open city? Of course this will be\nvery difficult, but let us nevertheless think without\ntaboos about absolutely all ways in which we could\nhelp the people. As chair of the Afghanistan Support\nGroup, Germany has issued an invitation to a meeting\nin Berlin at the beginning of December. I appeal to all\nStates to make a great humanitarian effort now and to\ncome to the aid of the downtrodden Afghan people.\nSolving regional conflicts will be of critical\nimportance in the fight against terrorism. The Middle\nEast conflict is a top priority. Our hearts go out to the\nmany innocent victims on all sides. Both the Israeli and\nPalestinian peoples have a right to live free of fear, in\ndignity and in peace. This is indivisible not only from\nIsrael\u2019s right of statehood, as recognized in Madrid \u2014\nwhich is, in our view, inviolable \u2014 but also from its\nsecurity. Germany bears a special responsibility\ntowards Israel stemming from its past. Any policy that\naims at destroying Israel by means of terrorism or\notherwise will face determined opposition from\nGermany. However, we equally advocate the\nPalestinians\u2019 right to self-determination and their right\nto their own State, Palestine. In the European Union\nBerlin Declaration of March 1999 we stated that \u201cthe\ncreation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign\nPalestinian State on the basis of existing agreements\nand through negotiations would be the best guarantee\nof Israel\u2019s security\u201d. This is truer today than ever\nbefore.\nNever before has there been broader international\nbacking for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. The Mitchell recommendations still form the\nbasis for the timetable accepted by all sides, and in\ntheir spirit we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike to\nput an immediate and lasting end to violence and\nconfrontation, to resume the agreed direct talks without\ndelay and to seriously implement the negotiated\nceasefires. These talks must lead to genuine\nnegotiations on a viable political solution.\nThe real aim of the terrorists is to trigger a clash\nof civilizations and to inflame the situation in the Near\nand Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allow\nourselves to be drawn into such a conflict. We are\nfighting international terrorism, not Islam.\nWe must counter the terrorist strategy designed to\nbring about the clash of civilizations with a dialogue of\ncultures and religions. We need a spiritual debate based\non mutual understanding that attempts to reach genuine\nagreement on the fundamental values that unite us.\nSuch a dialogue presupposes the existence of shared\nvalues, but also respect for other traditions and\ndifferences between peoples. However, one thing must\nbe clear: human rights are universal, not Western\nvalues. Consensus was reached on them by the\ninternational community of States in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the human rights conventions.\nAny dialogue must build on the universality of\nhuman rights. It must be conducted with respect for the\ndignity of all involved, in tolerance and openness. It\nmust start at home, within cultures themselves. It can\nbear fruit only if it is pursued free of all constraint.\nAnd it has a purpose only if all participants are also\nready to offer self-criticism.\nThe insidious anthrax attacks since 11 September\nshow that the threat from weapons of mass destruction\nin terrorist hands, which yesterday seemed abstract, is\ntoday a real and deadly danger. The community of\nStates must do everything in its power to counter it\nwith a new push for non-proliferation and global\ndisarmament.\nThe dangers of the dissemination of weapons to\nnon-State groups and of regional arms races require\nnew answers and effective, internationally enforceable\ncriminal sanctions. In the nuclear field, the\ncommitment contained in the Non-Proliferation Treaty\nto complete nuclear disarmament remains crucial. As\nregards biological weapons, in view of the acute threat,\neffective global control mechanisms must finally be\ncreated. The Chemical Weapons Convention must be\nmore rigorously implemented. All States are called\n14\n\nupon to participate in the negotiation of an\ninternational code of conduct on ballistic missile\nproliferation.\nThe fight now beginning against terrorism must\nbuild on the awareness that the first world cannot in the\nlong term live secure and safe from the tensions and\nconflicts of the third world. Almost one quarter of the\nworld population is starving. Ninety-five per cent of\nthose infected with AIDS live in developing countries.\nAfrica is particularly hard hit. At present only a\nminority of the world\u2019s citizens profit from the\nopportunities for growth offered by globalization and\nfrom the use of the new information technologies. This\nstate of affairs cannot be accepted, even by the rich\ncountries \u2014 for moral reasons, but also because\ntensions and conflicts today spread much more quickly\nand widely than ever before.\nThe battle against poverty cannot be won unless\nwe take equally determined steps to preserve the\nnatural resources on which life depends. At the coming\nWorld Summit in Johannesburg we must make a\nquantum leap forward towards sustainable\ndevelopment, improved poverty eradication and better\nmanagement of our natural resources. The Kyoto\nProtocol must enter into force next year. And we must\nstrengthen the sole advocate of the global environment,\nthe United Nations Environment Programme,\ninstitutionally, operationally and financially.\n11 September made it horrifyingly clear that the\nhuman race will not be able to live in peace and\nsecurity in the absence of political order at the global\nand regional levels.\nGermany will continue to do its utmost to bring\nabout the strengthening of the United Nations and its\ncapacity to act, so that the world will be a more\npeaceful, just and humane place in the twenty-first\ncentury than it was in the twentieth century. The future\nbelongs to responsible governance for one world,\ngovernance based not on hegemonic claims, but on\ncooperation, solidarity and multilateralism. If together\nwe succeed in implementing such a policy, we will not\njust ultimately win the war against terrorism but will\nalso be able to eradicate its roots forever.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your\nelection, which is a mark of recognition of the\nRepublic of Korea and of your distinguished personal\nrecord in the public and academic spheres. I am\n26\n\nconfident that, under your guidance, the work of the\nAssembly will be successful for the States Members of\nthe United Nations.\nToday New York is receiving us as it always has.\nWhy, then, did we witness, two months ago, a terrorist\nact that shook the world? If I may be allowed to say so,\nit is because New York is the city that best represents\nthe values that the twentieth century defended at the\ncost of tremendous suffering. It is a city that welcomes\nthose persecuted by intolerance of all kinds; respects\nall nationalities, races and religions, all ideas, and the\nfreedom to think and to create; offers opportunities for\nall to succeed; and protects individual rights through\ndemocracy.\nIt is not by chance that it was here in New York,\non the banks of the East River, that the Headquarters of\nthe United Nations was erected. It was built here\nbecause the values of this city are the values of our\nuniversal Organization of nations.\nThe terrorist attack on New York was therefore an\nattack on the unity of our nations. It was our values,\nour security and our faith in a better world \u2014 a world\nbased on dialogue and cooperation \u2014 that were the\ntargets of terrorist fanaticism. That is why we have felt\nso close to the United States during this period: its pain\nis our pain; its grief is our grief; and its response to\nterrorism is our response.\nWe are here to reiterate our condolences to the\npeople and to the Government of the United States. The\nsight of thousands of persons bearing photographs of\ntheir lost family members amid the smoking ruins gave\nrise to a profound sense of empathy among Chileans.\nHence we wish to express our admiration for the\nunity and courage of the American people and of the\ncity of New York. We pay tribute to the Government of\nthe United States and to President Bush, who, faced\nwith an attack of this magnitude, has managed to act on\nthe basis of reason rather than emotion in seeking\ndiplomatic support and in building an extremely broad-\nbased coalition.\nThe holding of this General Assembly marks a\nsound defeat for the terrorist cause, which seeks to\nreplace dialogue with the cult of violence, and reflects\nour renewed faith in this world forum.\nWe are here to extend to the Secretary-General\nand to the United Nations our warmest congratulations\non having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which\nthis year has recognized the outstanding contribution of\nthe United Nations to our quest for peace.\nMany have remarked that the twentieth century\nhas been one of the most violent and deadly in the\nhistory of humankind. However, the twentieth century\nwas also the century that produced major advances,\nimproved our quality of life and eliminated great evils\nforever.\nThe First World War was followed by the League\nof Nations and by a new awareness of the fundamental\nequality of peoples. The Second World War was\nnecessary to put an end to fascism in its most\nmonstrous manifestations, but also out of it emerged\nthe United Nations, the decolonization process, the\nBretton Woods economic agreements and a new\nawareness of the fundamental equality of human\nbeings. The cold war brought about a clash between\ntwo political and economic visions, but, once ended, it\nleft in its wake a new awareness of democracy and\nindividual freedoms.\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, we are\nconfronting a new conflict of global proportions. Our\nfirst objective must be to put an end forever to\nfanaticism and to the kind of intolerance that is\ntranslated into terror.\nChile believes that this vast diplomatic alliance\nmust also pursue other objectives. Like other victorious\ncoalitions throughout history, it must begin to ask now\nwhat new progress it will seek to achieve for humanity\nafter its victory. We must start to envision the new\nworld that must emerge from this tragic period in our\nhistory \u2014 a world that is better organized and that\nshows more solidarity. Indeed, the terrorists will have\nachieved their objective if, as a result of their attacks,\nthe globalization process changes direction and begins\na trend towards less freedom and decreased\ninternational trade.\nOn the other hand, as the Secretary-General has\nso rightly said, in order to achieve success in the\nglobalization process, we must learn how to manage it\nbetter and, above all, how to manage it better together.\nI think that it is very important to understand that\nof the 6 billion people in the world, half are struggling\nto live on less than $2 a day. They have no personal\ncomputer; they have never made a telephone call. They\nhave never seen these things. Though wealth has\nincreased, there has been no significant decrease in the\n27\n\nnumber of poor people, and the gap between rich and\npoor is daily becoming increasingly difficult to bridge.\nThe balance of our world is becoming precarious, and\nwe must address this issue.\nThe recent tragic events have shown us that no\nnation on earth that can consider itself invulnerable and\nthat genuine security can be attained only through\ncooperation among peoples and States. What makes\nour citizens vulnerable today \u2014 besides terrorism \u2014\nare such phenomena as ignorance, hunger, drug\ntrafficking, climate change, uncontrolled population\nmovements, and the erratic flow of $1.5 trillion every\nday in financial markets. We must devise ways of\ntackling these phenomena.\nChile therefore supports the coalition of countries\nthat, in exercise of the right of self-defence, have\nembarked on a campaign aimed at eradicating\nterrorism. At stake here are the universal principles and\nvalues that we share and that we must defend. These\nactions, therefore, are not targeting the Afghan people\nor the Arab world, nor are they aimed at any particular\nreligion, all of which we deeply respect and admire.\nIn order to put an end to terrorism, there is a need\nfor broad, ongoing and resolute cooperation. That is\nwhy Chile has supported the responses decided upon in\nthis Organization. We are actively implementing\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). We are\nalready a party to the 12 global conventions against\nterrorism, and today we will deposit with the\nSecretary-General the respective instruments of\nratification. My country has ratified all United Nations\nagreements.\nSimilarly, we are working to coordinate\nAmerica\u2019s response. We are partners in a\ncomprehensive dialogue to review and improve each\ncountry\u2019s domestic legislation and legal order to root\nout the terrorist threat.\nWe reaffirm the need to strengthen measures to\npromote mutual confidence and cooperation in the area\nof defence. In that regard, Argentina and Chile have\nstandardized their data on military expenditures, and\nwe are working towards the same objective with our\nneighbour Peru.\nYet we cannot conceal our frustration at the\ndifficulties blocking progress towards limiting the\nmanufacture of and illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons.\nWe also feel obliged to say that we view with\nhorror the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.\nThat conflict poses a threat to international security.\nLike other delegations that have spoken today, we hope\nfor recognition of the inalienable right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination, including the\nright to establish an independent State, as well as the\nright of Israel to live within secure and internationally\nrecognized borders and at peace with its neighbours.\nRecent acts of international terrorism have\naffected our economies, which are the basis for social\nprogress for our peoples. Fear has gripped the markets.\nThe only certainty today is that uncertainty will prevail\nin the future so long as there is armed action because of\nthis conflict. If that proves to be the case, and if\ninternational markets fall, terrorism will have achieved\nan unexpected victory.\nI therefore want to say that institutions such as\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\nmust address the concerns of the international political\nbodies and devote special attention to the additional\ncosts of the response to terrorism. We are confident of\nsuccess at the Doha, Qatar, ministerial meeting, which\nwill be discussing ways to make trade freer. We want to\naddress items of concern to all: agricultural products,\nservices, intellectual property, anti-dumping and the\nsettlement of trade disputes. They are all on the\nagenda, and they must all be addressed.\nThe great coalition assembled to combat\nterrorism must also promote cooperation among\nGovernments in order to ensure that no areas are\nexcluded from globalization. That is the best way to\nguarantee security for us all. To create a safer world,\nwe need more and better globalization, not more\nautarky. We need more and better democracy, not more\ndictatorial authoritarianism. We must do a better job of\nprotecting human rights. Here, I believe we must act\npreventively to safeguard our democracies and to\nensure respect for human rights.\nDemocracy is strengthened with each free and\nsecret election with the participation of an informed\nelectorate. It is strengthened with higher levels of\njustice and social equality. To restore people\u2019s\nconfidence in democracy, democracy must be\ncomplemented by an end to social injustice. Neither\nlack of development nor specific cultural\ncharacteristics can be used as a pretext to justify\ncurtailing rights recognized in the Universal\n28\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The fight against\ndiscrimination and intolerance must be a frontal attack\non poverty.\nWe need institutions that ensure respect for\nhuman rights. Hence the importance of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which should serve as an\nkey instrument for the universal protection of\nfundamental human rights, whatever the status of the\nviolator.\nI have come from afar, from the South of the\nworld, with an optimistic vision. Before leaving my\ncountry, I met with young people of varied origins and\nwith dignitaries of different religions. I met with\nCatholic and Protestant bishops; with Jewish and\nMuslim representatives: all those with whom we share\nan annual joint religious service \u2014 unique in the\nworld \u2014 to celebrate our national independence. I saw\nin all of them \u2014 Jews and Muslims; Catholics,\nProtestants and freethinkers \u2014 a renewed capacity for\nunderstanding and comprehension that I am sure is\nshared among western and eastern countries, among\nethnic groups and religions \u2014 in short, among all those\nhere today \u2014 with the objective of attaining our\ncommon objective of peace and progress.\nLet us learn from our experience in assembling\nthis great global coalition to respond politically and\nmilitarily to the terrorist threat. Let us make it into a\ncoalition that also seeks other goals. In this coalition,\nall are important, irrespective of creed, race, political\nhistory or ideology; in the coalition there are no small\nor large countries.\nLet us ensure that international institutions take\ndue account of the interests of all countries, large,\nmedium-sized and small. Let us ensure that this grand\ncoalition will bring us security not only against\nterrorism but also against hunger, vulnerability and\ndiscrimination. I propose that we should update the\ninstitutions that the founders of the United Nations\ncreated here 50 years ago.\nThat would be the most fitting tribute to the\nvictims of terrorism and the best gauge of our\ncommitment to the weak and powerless of the Earth.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn congratulating Mr. Han\nSeung-soo upon his assumption of high office, I must\nalso praise his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\nFinland, for an outstanding tenure as the President who\nushered in the new millennium. If the Millennium\nSummit and its Declaration could be considered the\nhallmark of Mr. Holkeri\u2019s presidency, then Mr. Han\u2019s\nalready has one of equally impressive terms with the\nOrganization and its Secretary-General being awarded\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. Therefore, the re-election of\nMr. Kofi Annan for a second term as Secretary-General\nis sure testament not only to his own personal\ndedication, creative leadership and unwavering sense\nof spirit, but also to the vision and faith of the\nOrganization\u2019s Member States.\nI take this occasion to offer Tonga\u2019s solace to all\naffected delegations, and in particular the delegations\nof the Dominican Republic and the United States, for\nwhom the tragedy that befell their communities on 12\nNovember has such a profound bearing.\nLike other Member States, Tonga takes this\noccasion to express our sympathy and condolences to\nthe President and people of the United States for the\nsuffering and loss of life incurred during the attacks of\n11 September. In doing so, Tonga condemns in the\nstrongest possible terms these acts of terror, which\nremain without moral or lawful justification.\nThe events of 11 September have focused our\nOrganization\u2019s attention on terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations and, more importantly, on the need\nto address this issue comprehensively. As such, Tonga\ncommends the timely and decisive action taken by the\nSecurity Council with respect to the events of 11\nSeptember. In doing so, we fully support the work of\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee and its mandated\nefforts to combat terrorism.\nIt has been stated that terrorism offends the core\nvalues of our Organization, and that is true. The irony\nis that, inasmuch as the events of 11 September were\nan affront to one\u2019s sense of humanity, it is this very\nhumanity that has risen to prevail over extreme\nadversity. If last year\u2019s catchphrase during the\nMillennium Summit was \u201cWe, the peoples\u201d, that call is\nall the more pertinent this year in our collective efforts\nto combat terrorism.\nAs part of its contribution to these efforts, Tonga\nis taking steps to carefully study and consider the\nUnited Nations conventions on terrorism that it is not\n34\n\nparty to. However, merely becoming parties to\nconventions will not be sufficient. Concrete steps will\nbe needed if small countries like ours are to fully and\nmeaningfully take part in these efforts.\nFor example, Tonga\u2019s efforts to develop,\nimplement and maintain counter-terrorism measures\nwill require sustained financial and expert technical\nassistance on a solid foundation of a network of\ninformation exchange between relevant law\nenforcement and aviation agencies. In this regard, our\nefforts in combating terrorism will be but a microcosm\nfor addressing a wider plethora of development issues.\nAs much as the Millennium Declaration\nconcerned new commitments, or renewed commitments\nin some instances, Tonga commends the report of the\nSecretary-General for its innovation and detailed\ndescription as to how implementation of the\nDeclaration might be taken forward.\nWe look towards the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development as a further opportunity to\npursue a wide range of crucial thematic issues which\nare particularly critical to the development aspirations\nof developing countries. The balance required for\nforging consensus on these thematic issues is as\nimportant as the balance between official development\nassistance and the mobilization of limited domestic\nresources.\nWhile the Declaration of the recently concluded\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\nConference in Doha might give rise to optimism, Tonga\nseeks a simplified, streamlined and expeditious\naccession process for small island developing States\nlike ours who wish to join the WTO. In this regard, we\ncongratulate the People\u2019s Republic of China upon its\nentry into the organization. A more flexible approach\nand time frame within which to meet obligations are\nneeded to enable countries like Tonga to adopt\nmeasures so as to fully participate in the WTO system\nand to fulfil the obligations of the WTO agreements\nwhile minimizing any adverse impacts upon our\npopulace. Such an accession process can be achieved\nonly with continuing technical and financial assistance.\nWe further look towards the World Summit on\nSustainable Development as a complementary step in\nthe development path towards the reinvigoration of\ntargeted commitments to sustainable development \u2014\nespecially those concerning small island developing\nStates \u2014 as contained in Agenda 21. We continue to\ncall on the international community for refocused\ncommitment to and implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action. Tonga\u2019s preparations for this\nSummit, through its national assessment report, will\ninclude identifying areas for specific and priority\ncapacity-building needs as well as avenues by which to\ntake greater advantage of financial and technological\nsupport.\nWhile Tonga recognizes the merit of the\neconomic vulnerability index as a measure for\neconomic impacts, its application should encompass all\nsmall island developing States and not serve as a means\nto draw superficial differences between them. After all,\nthe economic vulnerability index is an accurate\nreflection of the true realities of small island\ndeveloping States, and if those realities are not fully\naddressed, we shall continue to perch precariously on\nthe edge of the precipice. Therefore, we continue to\nsupport the development of an appropriate\nenvironmental vulnerability index, and we commend\nthe work of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\nCommission in this regard. We believe that such an\nindex will provide accurate indicators of factors to\nwhich small islands are vulnerable, such as natural\ndisasters, sea-level rise and climate change. Tonga\ntherefore welcomes the consensus reached at\nMarrakech at the seventh session of the Conference of\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the further\nopportunities for progress that it presents.\nAs a developing ocean State, we continue to seek\nour fair share of the harvest from the ocean which\nbounds us on all sides. We welcome in particular the\npreparations for making effective the Convention on\nthe Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.\nWe urge the distant water fishing nations in our region\nwith a real interest in fisheries to make every effort to\nbecome party to a convention that is the hallmark of\nour commitment to the conservation and sustainable\nmanagement of a critically important resource. Tonga\ncontinues to value the work and decisions this year at\nthe eleventh Meeting of States Parties to the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the\nInternational Seabed Authority and the United Nations\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\nand the Law of the Sea \u2014 UNICPOLOS.\nWe continue to view information and\ncommunication technologies as the way to go, and we\n35\n\nare making our own efforts to bridge the digital divide\nto take full advantage of the digital revolution.\nMaximizing such efforts will require complementary\nefforts in tandem with the international community and\nthe United Nations. We urge continued support for the\nSmall Islands Developing States Network, SIDSnet,\nand efforts to strengthen its capacity to support and\nassist small island developing States.\nTonga welcomes the adoption of the Declaration\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the establishment of\nthe global fund to combat this scourge. We look\nforward to the implementation of the Declaration and\ncommend those Member States who have pledged their\nfinancial support to the fund.\nWe continue to support the effort to reform the\nSecurity Council. In this regard, as was presented by a\ndelegation during the debate on Security Council\nreform, we could support either proposal for an\nexpansion of the number of permanent seats: by two,\nwith an expansion of the number of non-permanent\nseats by three, or, alternatively, by three, with the\nnumber of non-permanent seats increased by four.\nWhile cognizant that issues pertaining to the veto and\nits exercise in such an expansion would continue to\ndemand handling with the utmost sensitivity and care,\nwe urge that where there are issues of convergence,\nsteps should be taken to consolidate such convergence,\nand where unresolved issues remain, that these be the\nfocus of continuing dialogue and discussion.\nFinally, with respect to pertinent regional issues\nin the Pacific, Tonga endorses the views expressed in\nthe Nauru communiqu\u00e9, now contained in document\nA/56/388, which was the outcome of the annual\nmeeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders at Nauru in\nAugust this year.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAll our\nadmiration goes to the United States for making\npossible the normal work of the United Nations and the\nsessions of the General Assembly despite the recent\ntragic events and all their global consequences. The\ntragic crime, which affected the whole world, has\nbrutally confronted us with new, very serious and long-\nterm issues. This year\u2019s general debate is thus an\nopportunity and a new and great responsibility for us\nall \u2014 a responsibility that must be accepted. Words of\ncondemnation and solidarity cannot be enough.\nAs we sympathize profoundly with the American\npeople, we must also tell the world in one voice that we\nshall be deliberately and effectively allied in the future,\ntoo, and that we will cooperate in the fight against\nterrorism and in the eradication of the roots of that evil.\nWe will responsibly consider joint measures for a\nworld of more peace, greater freedom, solidarity and\nsecurity and more social justice for every person and\nevery nation, as well as ever less room for violence.\nThe idea of such a world requires us to avoid the\nvortex of evil by undertaking a considered and resolute\nresponse to the terrorist crime that was committed. The\nimmediate decisive military reaction of the United\nStates of America and other countries of the anti-\nterrorist alliance was imperative.\nWe cannot simply rest at that, however. The\nvortex of violence could threaten the democratic values\nthat humanity has set over its long development as the\nmeasure of life in human society. That is why we are\nultimately obliged to avoid dividing cultures along the\nprinciple of \u201cus versus them\u201d, dividing races, religions\nand nations into the categories of civilized and\nbarbaric, and ascribing a priori fundamentalism to any\nreligion or civilization. The United Nations has\nproclaimed this year the Year of Dialogue Among\nCivilizations. We should seize this opportunity.\nThe contemporary world is diverse, but all\nmodern civilizations, cultures and major religions\nrespect human dignity and human life. Killing is an\naberration anywhere in the world. Sadly, human and\nsocial pathology have made killing a lucrative business\nand given international terrorism its own internal\ndynamic. The instigators and perpetrators of these\ndespicable acts must be brought to justice, while it is\nthe responsibility of politics to remove the social and\npolitical roots of this evil. It is the universal values of\nall contemporary civilizations, such as the sanctity of\nlife and respect for human dignity, that enable the\ncreation of a global democracy based on a global ethos.\nResolute action and attention must focus on those\ngroups and individuals throughout the world who\nbrutally violate these principles and bring chaos,\nmurder and madness into our human world. Sadly,\nthere are enough such people in all cultures and\ncivilizations in all parts of the human world, including\nthe Christian world. They warn us that the global world\nrequires a different perception of the world and its\ndilemmas, especially of the unequal distribution of\npoverty and wealth, and that it raises questions to\nwhich there are as yet no answers.\nAt the Millennium Summit last year, we came\nvery close to a realistic analysis of some of the major\neconomic, financial, social, cultural, political and\necological effects of the global economy. We have\ncome closer to the important understanding that a\nglobal world also requires global responsibility, and\nthat starts with the responsibility of each State.\nStates cannot arbitrarily do things that are in\ncomplete conflict with the values of the democratic\nworld. In particular, cannot systematically violate basic\nhuman rights and freedoms through State violence, nor\ncan they allow and encourage activities that threaten\nthe security of other countries and of the international\ncommunity, all in the name of their own sovereignty,\neven within their own boundaries. Neither can they\nignore such activity by others and shut themselves\nbehind their own borders.\nLast year\u2019s position on humanitarian intervention\nwas the first step in this direction, yet, unfortunately,\nnot a sufficient one. The escalation of internationally\nsyndicated and organized terrorism demands that\nfurther steps be taken. We cannot allow terrorism and\ncrime to abuse the opportunities offered by our\nglobalized world before the democratic world itself is\neven in a position to put these opportunities to good\nuse in finding answers to completely new challenges.\nI see these challenges in pronounced divisions\nwith global implications \u2014 divisions into owners of\ncapital, knowledge, ideas and information\ntechnologies, on the one hand, and the billions\ncondemned to ignorance, a life of poverty and\nvegetating without prospects at the margins of society,\n11\n\non the other hand, in the ever greater financial\nweakness of many nation-States and whole continents\nthat are left without development potentials or\nprospects. In its relentless growth in power and\nauthority, global capital has long since gone beyond\nState borders. However, it assumes no responsibility\nfor people\u2019s social position and prospects for freedom\nand democracy, for development and the future, for\npeople\u2019s security. This responsibility is left to State\nadministrations.\nI also see challenges in all kinds of\nfundamentalism, even in the perverted understanding\nof competitiveness which leads to production and\nservices with an ever-shrinking labour force, without\ncaring about people and nature, about life on the planet\nand its future in an economy whose only motive and\naim is profit.\nI see them also in the very pragmatically oriented\nnational and international politics operating in a\nframework of dramatic simplicity and simplification,\nand so their euphoric haste does not match their effect.\nThese are politics that ignore the dimension of time\nand the duration of phenomena, such as the ecological\neffects of genetic or biomedical interventions that are\nnot apparent immediately, but perhaps only in decades,\nonly with the coming generations.\nI see challenges in the neglect of a comprehensive\nand interconnected perspective on phenomena and\nprocesses and in the disregard for the way in which\nthey are interconnected. All modern political, social\nand ecological dramas and conflicts, as well as the\nglobal socio-pathological cancers, are a result of\nthe interaction of a range of social forces and\nelements. These phenomena \u2014 including international\nterrorism \u2014 which are like epidemics, cannot be\nconfined within the borders of one or more States. This\napplies to a host of phenomena, not just terrorism, but\nalso ecology, food, genetics, finance, the information\nsociety and violence.\nI also see challenges in the lack of\ncommunication between the authorities and\nincreasingly global civil movements. Protests from\nSeattle to Genoa are a powerful warning of the danger\nof a division into two worlds that are beginning to\ncommunicate solely through protests and violence.\nThe world today is clearly different from what it\nwas before. It could be better, but only with an\nawareness of and mechanisms for assuming global\nresponsibility. This will enable the search for a\ndynamic balance leaving no room for the chaos that\nuncontrolled developments and acts of terror lead to. In\norder to achieve this, we will have to change many\nthings.\nTherefore, adapting the United Nations to these\nnew circumstances is, in a way, a call of distress. It will\nnot be a simple task. All 189 Members and their\nrepresentatives are bound primarily to the sovereignty\nof their own States. However, the world clearly also\nneeds global governance. More than ever, we need the\nUnited Nations as a global entity common to all States,\nan entity that will be able, with the full authority that\nrests on the global responsibility of States, to take\nmeasures to the benefit of dynamic development, a\ndevelopment of balanced forces and effects of the\nglobal economy and globalization in general.\nOtherwise, we will have to state the alternative.\nWe must accept the recognition that every society,\nincluding the global one, must subordinate itself to\nspecific rules, or else it will be subjected to the rule of\ncrude force. Our difficulty is that we have overlooked\nthat the world has become a single society full of\ninternal contrasts, which in real life, especially in\ninternational relations, recognizes and respects few\nrules. What we urgently need is the common political\nwill to provide legitimacy to a universal system of\ninstitutions and bodies, to which together we have\nentrusted the power to prescribe common rules.\nWe need common political will to subject\nourselves to these rules and to respect them. The actual\npower to prescribe rules would not be only in the hands\nof States. Could this also be the United Nations? What\nreforms are needed to achieve this, in order for the\nUnited Nations to become this? We cannot wait with\nthe answers.\nI am also speaking from the experience of\nSlovenia, which I represent. In gaining independence\n10 years ago, we experienced brief but serious violence\non our own territory. In our immediate vicinity, South-\nEastern Europe, we were faced with one of the most\nbarbaric policies since the Second World War, a policy\nresponsible for genocide and other forms of widespread\nviolence. With independence, Slovenia stepped into a\nworld that is prepared to behave better than the self-\nenclosed world that the former Yugoslavia had become\nin the final years of its life, when the equality of rights\nof people and nations was violated and when hope for a\n12\n\ndifferent future was denied. We have stepped onto the\npath of freedom, and Slovenia has accepted its own\nshare of the responsibility for our global world.\nI believe that this global world will tend toward a\ndynamic balance, provided that States \u2014 large and\nsmall, rich and poor, technologically developed and\nmarginalized \u2014 will together seek new solutions. The\nvenue can only be a fundamentally reformed United\nNations. It is within such a United Nations that both a\ndurable coalition against terrorism and a durable\ncoalition of common responsibility of all countries for\na world with more solidarity and social justice for all\nhumanity and all its parts can be achieved.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me at the outset\nexpress our deepest condolences to the families of the\nvictims of Monday\u2019s tragic accident in Queens, New\nYork.\nI am particularly pleased to see Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo guiding the General Assembly during this session.\nI wish to assure him of my delegation\u2019s fullest support\nin all his endeavours. I would like also to extend my\n32\n\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his election to a\nsecond term of office as Secretary-General.\nIt is also with great satisfaction that we join other\nspeakers in congratulating Mr. Kofi Annan on having\nbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We are proud that\nthe one hundredth Nobel Prize also honoured the\nUnited Nations as a whole. As rightly pointed out by\nthe Secretary-General, this \u201cchallenges us to do more\nand to do better\u201d. It is our responsibility to ensure that\nthe Organization is at the forefront of efforts to achieve\npeace and security in the world.\nThis year Lithuania is celebrating the tenth\nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations.\nOn 17 September 1991, our nation proudly watched as\nthe Lithuanian flag was raised for the first time at the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the 10 years that have elapsed, we have seen a\nrapid transformation in the world order. The world\naround us has shrunk with incredible speed. The\nbenefits accruing from globalization have made us\nmore dependent upon each other and thus more\nvulnerable to complex phenomena that affect the\nstability and security of our societies.\nTerrorism does not recognize national borders. It\nspills over into international terrain, no matter how\ningenious the defences are that have been put in place.\nOnly through the common efforts of the international\ncommunity will it be possible to create successful\ndefence mechanisms. Indeed, on 11 September, the\nworld grasped the sheer magnitude of the defences that\nwill be required.\nTerrorism is closely linked to extreme poverty,\nmarginalization, human rights violations, ethnic strife,\nthe proliferation of arms and drug trafficking. Thus, it\nis essential in the long term to devise and carry out an\nanti-terrorism policy that is inclusive and spans all\nregions and continents.\nI wish to express once again from this rostrum my\nnation\u2019s strong condemnation of terrorist actions and to\nreaffirm our solidarity with the people of the United\nStates. We are determined to stand alongside the\ninternational community in combating terrorism. In the\nimmediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Lithuania\nsupported the actions taken by the European Union and\nthe North Atlantic Alliance, including the decision of\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to\ninvoke article 5 of the Washington Treaty. My\nGovernment has decided to grant permanent diplomatic\nclearance for the overflight and landing of United\nStates Government aircraft.\nAn important step aimed at combating and\npreventing terrorism was the adoption of an\nunprecedented Security Council resolution: resolution\n1373 (2001). Now it is up to Governments to act\nwithout delay in following through the detailed\nrequirements of the resolution.\nThe General Assembly should also make its own\ncontribution, first of all, by speeding up its work on the\ndraft comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism.\nDomestic legal steps to be taken by Member\nStates include ratification of the 12 United Nations\nmultilateral instruments directly designed for the\nsuppression of terrorism. Lithuania has already stepped\nup its efforts to accede to the remaining five\nConventions.\nIn this endeavour, the experience and practice of\nother international bodies in the fight against terrorism\nshould not be forgotten. For instance, the Council of\nEurope has successfully elaborated a number of\ntreaties, such as the European Convention on the\nSuppression of Terrorism, the European Convention on\nExtradition and its Protocols, and so on. The\nexperience of this regional organization could also be\nused in the field of crime prevention, money-\nlaundering and corruption. It is noteworthy that\ninstruments of the European treaty system are also\nopen to non-member States.\nJust last week \u2014 meeting in Warsaw at a\nconference of heads of State of Central and Eastern\nEurope on the common fight against terrorism \u2014 17\nleaders from the region, including from my own\ncountry, adopted a declaration on cooperation in the\ncombat against terrorism and a plan of action against\nterrorism. It is aimed at improving cooperation among\nintelligence, customs and police services and cracking\ndown on money-laundering and drug trafficking.\nThe challenges posed by a globalized world are\nmultifarious and interrelated. They require diverse and\nversatile actions. Therefore, due consideration and\nresources should be devoted to the problems of arms\ncontrol and disarmament, as well as to poverty\neradication and sustainable development.\n33\n\nIn this regard, I would like to note the resolution\nadopted just a few weeks ago by the First Committee\non multilateral cooperation in the area of disarmament\nand non-proliferation and on global efforts against\nterrorism. It puts a clear focus on multilateral efforts to\ncombat international terrorism and fight proliferation.\nThe results of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty (CTBT) article XIV Conference have\nrekindled the hope that widespread concerns about the\ndelayed entry into force of the Treaty will be taken into\naccount. We also hope that the implementation of the\n13 steps agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conference\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) will not be put on hold. Likewise,\nintensive bilateral consultations between the United\nStates and the Russian Federation on a new strategic\nframework will, it is hoped, foster a common\nunderstanding and provide a basis for deep reductions\nin all classes of nuclear weapons, consistent with the\ncommitments under article VI of the NPT.\nStrengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons\nConvention also remains an urgent priority.\nThe 2001 Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has yielded\na Programme of Action, a strategy and the political\nmomentum to deal with the proliferation and misuse of\nsmall arms. There needs to be a follow-up process to\ntackle their brokering, marking and transportation and\nto build upon the measures agreed thus far. In the\nmeantime, we believe that the strict implementation of\nthe Programme of Action will bring about a real\nchange at the end of the day.\nHistory has proved that democratic, prosperous\nStates provide the most favourable environment for\nhuman activities. The United Nations should therefore\ncontinue its efforts to promote democratization and\nsustainable development. I would also like to\nunderscore the need to pay even greater attention to the\npromotion and protection of human rights.\nToday we face the challenges of a globalized\nworld, which are the result of rapidly developing\ntechnologies and human negligence. These challenges,\nalthough not as evident as open military conflicts, are\nno less threatening. A devastated and deteriorating\nenvironment could cause conflicts of an unprecedented\nscale.\nNo effort should be spared to free people from the\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\nAssistance, new trade arrangements and debt relief\nshould be complemented by firm commitments to\npoverty reduction, economic equality and measures to\nsupport education; they should be reflected first and\nforemost in the national policies of individual States\nand, at the same time, on the agendas of international\norganizations. In this regard, we commit ourselves to\nensuring successful preparation for the International\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\nThe Summit, in Johannesburg, should make\nconcrete contributions to the eradication of poverty and\nthe promotion of sustainable modes of production and\nconsumption. In this regard, the Government of\nLithuania, in its domestic policy, aims at economic\ndevelopment that does not harm the overall quality of\nthe environment. Priority is given to promoting\ninvestment aimed at the prevention of pollution,  the\nuse of clean fuel and energy sources and the\nintroduction of low-waste and other progressive\nenvironmental technologies.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment should focus on better mobilization and\nmore effective use of financial resources and find ways\nfor more efficient cooperation between all development\nactors. The meeting will set strategic goals of policy\ncoherence in order to integrate into the world economy\ncountries with differing levels of economic\ndevelopment. The Bretton Woods institutions and the\nprivate sector should play important roles in the\ndevelopment process.\nThe events of 11 September have proved how\nfragile international security can be. Moreover, in\ndefence of our common values \u2014 freedom, democracy\nand openness \u2014 no nation can idly stand by or act\nunilaterally. Every nation must pull its own weight in\ncontributing to regional and international stability.\nStrengthening dialogue and understanding among\nnations and civilizations should also remain in the\nforefront of our thinking. Better understanding and\nidentified common values will foster trust and\ntolerance among people, preventing the spread of\nfanaticism, violence and terrorism. Lithuania made its\ncontribution to these goals by hosting the International\nConference on Dialogue among Civilizations in April\nthis year.\nIt is of crucial importance to Lithuania to\nparticipate actively in international organizations and\n34\n\nto contribute to peacekeeping efforts. We have\ncontinued to provide our civilian police officers to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations through the\nUnited Nations Standby Arrangements System. Our\ntroops have been serving in the Balkans since the very\nbeginning of the international engagement in that\nregion. Just a few days ago, a Lithuanian medical\nsquad, a small, but much-needed contribution to the\nUnited Nations, was placed under the Standby\nArrangements System. Shortly, Lithuania will submit\nits application for full-fledged membership in the\nUnited Nations Standby Forces High-Readiness\nBrigade.\nMembership in the European Union and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization will solidify our region\u2019s\ninstitutional, economic and security ties. Lithuania is\nsparing no effort in preparing for the challenges of a\nunified pan-Atlantic family of democracies. The work\nof the Vilnius 10 group, initiated a few years ago and\nlaunched in Vilnius, is proof of the ability of the\nregion\u2019s States to promote transparency, partnership\nand common values.\nAt the subregional level, Lithuania stresses\npractical cooperative efforts to promote democratic and\neconomic transformation throughout the region. Over\nthe last decade, our engagement with Poland has\nbecome a close partnership. Dynamic trilateral Baltic\ncooperation has become part of broader Baltic-Nordic\ncooperation. Excellent cross-border cooperation with\nthe Kaliningrad region has given rise to many dynamic\ndevelopments.\nJust a couple of days ago, on 8 November,\nLithuania assumed the chairmanship of the Committee\nof Ministers of the Council of Europe. The Council of\nEurope, based on the common values of pluralist\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law, already\nhas a history of cooperation with the United Nations\nand its agencies, most notably in the field of human\nrights. Recent joint efforts by the United Nations, the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\nand the Council of Europe to facilitate recovery of\nSouth-Eastern Europe have proved to be of the utmost\nsignificance for the people of the region, and have\nopened a new chapter of cooperation between these\norganizations.\nDuring its chairmanship, Lithuania will seek to\nstimulate dialogue between the Council of Europe and\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies. We\nencourage a regular exchange of views on issues\nrelated to the fight against and prevention of terrorism,\norganized crime and money-laundering. Intensive\ncoordination with regard to setting standards for\npluralist democracy and respect for human rights will\nalso be promoted.\nIn the work of the Council of Europe, the\nLithuanian chairmanship will focus mainly on fighting\nterrorism, supporting the enlargement process of the\nCouncil of Europe, promoting regional cooperation and\nensuring the effective functioning of the organization.\nWith the aim of building a modern pan-European\nsociety, we will keep working to establish a wider\nEuropean identity, sharing the best practices of the\nCouncil of Europe with other organizations and States,\nand strengthening the impact of the Council of Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our felicitations also go to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United\nNations on being honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe brutal and tragic events that took place in\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\nSeptember were the result of acts against not only the\nUnited States, but the international community at large.\nIn his message of condolence to President George\nW. Bush, the President of the Republic of Seychelles,\nMr. France Albert Ren\u00e9, condemned the terrorist\nattacks in the strongest terms, stating\n\u201cOur global village cannot tolerate such acts that\ndisrespect the value of human life and jeopardize\nworld peace and stability.\u201d\nThe subsequent military action in Afghanistan\nwas understood, in principle, by the Seychelles\nGovernment as being in accordance with Article 51 of\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Our Minister for\nForeign Affairs, in an interview with the local media,\nreferred to this military action as \u201cself-defence\u201d, and\nexpressed the wish that only the terrorist networks and\ntheir clearly identified allies would be targeted, as part\nof a carefully proportioned action plan, sparing civilian\npopulations and avoiding any kind of linkage between\nreligious faiths and ideologically based deviation.\nThe Seychelles Government agrees with the\nfollowing principles. Terrorism is a threat to\ninternational peace and security. There is no political or\nreligious justification for such violence. We vigorously\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nFurther to the events of 11 September, Seychelles\nrecognizes the right of the United States Government\nto react under guiding principles of international law\nand to bring the perpetrators to justice. But there is also\na need to acknowledge the root causes of terrorism,\nincluding extreme poverty, despair and injustice, and to\nstrongly advocate concerted efforts and collective\ncommitment throughout the world to eradicate poverty\nand underdevelopment. Based on those principles and\nconcerns, the position of my Government does not\ndiverge from the views and recommendations\nexpressed by the international community.\nWe appreciate the authority of the United Nations\nin providing global legitimacy for a universal response\nagainst terrorism. The war on terrorism must be fought\non many fronts. The elaboration of a broad, long-term\nstrategy for combating international terrorism,\nincluding military, political, diplomatic, legal and\neconomic means, is of paramount importance.\nSeychelles welcomes Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001, which outlines\nclear steps and measures that all United Nations\nMember States must now implement in order to\nprevent and suppress terrorist activities. My country is\nfully committed to implementing the provisions of the\nresolution, despite being handicapped by the\nconstraints linked to lack of capacities and resources.\nSeychelles is a party to six of the 12 existing\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols on terrorism.\nMy Government is taking steps to accede to the\nremaining six. Furthermore, we have also decided to\naccede to the 1999 Organization of African Unity\nAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combating\nof Terrorism.\nSeychelles fully supports the ongoing\nnegotiations to elaborate a comprehensive convention\non international terrorism. We commend the personal\nintervention of Secretary-General Annan in trying to\nbridge differences and achieve consensus. It is our\nhope that, despite the complex and sensitive nature of\nthe issues being addressed, the international\ncommunity will arrive at an agreement very soon.\nBearing in mind the unprecedented international\nmobilization against terrorism and the magnitude of the\n33\n\npresent situation, we consider that the larger,\ninfluential Members of the United Nations, particularly\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, should\nmanifest their strong political will and backing in\nresolving regional conflicts in all parts of the globe.\nAbove all, they must intensify their efforts to achieve a\nlasting peace in the Middle East. Let us not\nunderestimate the fact that regional conflicts are often\nbreeding grounds for terrorism.\nIt was mentioned earlier that terrorism is rooted\nin poverty. The United Nations must engage its full\npotential to vigorously pursue its development agenda.\nThis should comprise, inter alia, the drive for the\nalleviation of poverty and achieving sustainable\ndevelopment, the quest for equitable distribution of the\nbenefits of globalization, and the achievement of the\nMillennium Summit goals, as well as the success of\nnext year\u2019s International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nAs a small island State whose economy depends\nmainly on tourism and related industries, Seychelles\u2019\nvulnerability is obviously at issue should the ongoing\nmilitary campaign in Afghanistan persist. As a peaceful\ncommunity enjoying stability and social harmony,\nSeychelles, without questioning its strong moral\nsupport for the cause of international security, also\nencourages a dialogue giving the voices of reason and\ncompassion a chance to be heard, especially with\nregard to the needs of the Afghan people, who have\nlived three decades of war, resulting in the suffering of\nvery large numbers of refugees and displaced persons.\nFinally, my country would like to lay stress on the\nurgency for the United Nations to rethink the world\norder, not just in terms of geopolitical balance, but in\nterms of a new ethic. International terrorism cannot be\nfought by way of offensive weapons, either traditional\nor sophisticated. To agree on a common value system\nis, in the middle and long terms, a more profitable\norientation for the whole of humanity.\nThis being said, my country renews its adhesion\nto the international coalition of nations that are united\nin the war on international terrorism and in the quest\nfor worldwide peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis is the first time I have had the privilege of\naddressing this prestigious world forum. To arrive here,\nI travelled a long road. I was born in a small village\nhigh in the Andes, at an altitude of nearly 4,000 metres\nabove sea level. Like millions of brothers from our\ncontinent of Latin America, I know first-hand the hard\nface of poverty.\nTo survive, in my childhood, I sold newspapers,\nlottery tickets and shined the shoes in which others\nwalked.\nToday, I have come before this world assembly as\nthe constitutional President of Peru, bringing the\nstories, the hopes and the dreams of millions of\nPeruvians.\nI come from a country that is heir to an ancient\nculture and the cradle of great civilizations. I come to\nlead our present with responsibility and to construct\nour future with vision. Thus, in these few brief\nminutes, I would like to share with the Assembly three\nsubjects that are of the greatest concern to my\nGovernment:\nFirst of all, I would like to be clear about one\nthing: we are engaged in a head-on struggle against\nterrorism and its perverse alliance with drug trafficking\nand corruption. These are scourges for which there can\nbe no room for ambiguity. With the same\ndetermination, however, I need to point out that the\nworld is facing the enormous challenge of mustering\nthe necessary clear vision so as not to put off the\nhuman development agenda, which in large measure is\nthe underlying principle of the United Nations.\nSecondly, there is the need to reduce military\nexpenditures in Latin America and in the world, so that\nthese resources can be channelled instead into a direct\nfight against poverty.\nThirdly, we need to think and act together in\ndealing with the world economic situation to protect\nemployment opportunities and income for the poorest.\nThere can be no real democracy without sustained\neconomic growth that will generate decent jobs.\nBarely a year ago, Peru was enmeshed in a\ndramatic struggle between a corrupt dictatorship and\nthe hopes for democracy of the vast majority of the\nPeruvian people. Faced with this situation, we\nPeruvians stood up and proved capable of mobilizing\nourselves and peacefully struggling to regain our\ndemocracy and our freedom. On behalf of millions of\nmen and women of my country, I would like to thank\nthe peoples and Governments of the world for their\nfriendship, active role and solidarity in helping us\nregain our democracy.\nToday, Peru has now begun a new democratic\ndawn. We are aware, however, that we have great\nresponsibilities. We must strengthen a full-fledged\ndemocracy and our still fragile institutions and\nreactivate our economy so as to achieve sustainable\ngrowth that will generate decent and productive jobs.\nWe must strengthen our institutions and defeat poverty,\nwhich form an indissoluble part of the same goal,\nbecause poverty, corruption and drug trafficking\nconspire against democracy. We can now declare, here\nbefore the international community, that the time has\ncome to give a human face to globalization, so that\ncompetitiveness becomes permanent.\nWe Peruvians have freshly inscribed in our\ncollective memory a horror of terrorism. During the 20\nyears of terror, Peru has lost 25,000 human lives, which\nhas cost more than $30 billion and has left the poor\neven poorer. That is why I reaffirm our deep solidarity\nwith the people and Government of the United States in\nthe face of the insanity of terror of 11 September. This\nwas not an attack against the United States alone. It\nwas an attack against the peoples that believe in peace\nand democracy, for all our differences of opinion.\nWe are determined to take unambiguous actions\nto fight terrorism. We shall do so in the spirit of respect\nfor religious freedoms and ethnic identity. We will\nactively contribute to the work that has been entrusted\nto the ad hoc Committee of the Security Council,\nmaking available to it the experts that may be\nnecessary to intelligently fight the threat of\ninternational terrorism within the framework of the\nprinciples of the Charter and the decisions of the\nSecurity Council.\nAt an inter-American multilateral forum, we\nmade an effective contribution. This week we\nintroduced before the Organization of American States\na draft convention against terrorism. In keeping with\nthis purpose, this morning we deposited at the\nSecretary-General\u2019s office the following instruments:\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court; the\n9\n\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings; and the International Convention\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\nThus, my country has become a party to all\ninternational treaties against terrorism.\nOur States must build up an extensive network of\nobligations to effectively cooperate in the judicial,\npolice, information and financial fields to facilitate the\ncapture and extradition of the perpetrators of crimes\nagainst humanity or of acts of corruption that lead to\nsuch crimes. Human rights violations and corruption\nare two sides of the same coin. They spell impunity.\nIt would not be possible to face up to corruption\nwithout linking it with the fight against drug trafficking\nand money laundering. We are working hard in this\nregard. We have established high-level authorities\ndirectly under the head of State to wage the fight\nagainst drug trafficking and corruption.\nI know that this is a decision that impinges upon\npowerful interests. We shall not be swayed from our\ndetermination. Peru is now seeking to re-establish\ndemocracy to the fullest. We are aware, however, that\nthere are powerful forces hidden in the shadows,\nwhich, with certain political accomplices, are trying to\nachieve impunity for the corruption committed during\nthe decade of Montesinos and Fujimori. That is why,\naddressing you from this prestigious forum, I call on\nthe international community not to allow, as the\nglobalization of justice process, for capricious\ninterpretation of certain national laws that trivialize\nactions or allow for the granting of impunity.\nThere is no justification for a democratic\ngovernment to sacrifice development of the poor for\nthe sake of an arms race. Therefore, the second issue\ncentral to our foreign policy is our proposal, which we\nput to the Heads of State and Government of Latin\nAmerica, for an immediate freeze on the purchase of\noffensive weapons in the region. We also seek an\nagreement among the countries of Latin America to\nreduce their military expenditures and to reorient their\nfinancial resources towards investment in nutrition,\nhealth and education.\nPeru has recently achieved important agreements\non this issue with the brotherly countries of Chile and\nEcuador and is promoting an understanding among the\nother countries of our region that will allow us to\nembark together on the path towards the reduction of\npoverty there. Peace is not only the silence of guns; it\nshould also mean dignity for the poor. This proposal is\naimed at the adoption of a broad regional framework to\nreduce military spending. However, might we not also\nconsider expanding this proposal, which is not a new\none, to other regions around the globe? We must invest\nin the great enterprise of knowledge \u2014 in the minds of\nour people. That means investing more, and more\nwisely, in nutrition, health and education.\nThe third item relates to our concern about the\nglobal economy. We regret the onset of recession in the\nmost important developed economies, which is\nshrinking markets, eliminating jobs and thus hindering\nthe implementation of the measures set out in the\nMillennium Declaration. There is an urgent need to\ncontrol the damage being done to the poor economies\nby the current global economic crisis. It is therefore\nimportant that the next round of the World Trade\nOrganization not be an aseptic commercial round. It\nshould be a round on behalf of the poorest, avoiding\nprotectionist policies for the agricultural sector of the\nindustrialized countries and allowing the textile\nindustry to create good jobs in our countries.\nI call on the people of the world to embark\nunflinchingly and without fear on the path towards a\nfuture of peace and democracy, without terrorism,\nwithout violations of human rights and without\nimpunity. I am convinced that, together, we can build a\nglobalized, competitive yet united world with a human\nface. In that respect, Peru assumes its responsibility\ntoday before the General Assembly."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike to begin by extending my congratulations to you,\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I would also like to\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\nre-election to a second term as Secretary-General of the\nUnited Nations. I also wish to congratulate him and the\nUnited Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace\nPrize.\nIt is important for me to be here today at this\nmeeting, which is being held in very critical and\nimportant circumstances in the aftermath of the\nhorrific, criminal and ugly terrorist acts against the\ncities of New York and Washington, D.C., on 11\nSeptember 2001. We strongly condemn those acts. In\nthis context, I would once more like to extend our\ndeepest and warmest sympathy to President George W.\nBush and to the Government and the friendly people of\nthe United States. In particular, I wish to express my\ncondolences to the families of the victims.\nThe Palestinian people have expressed their\nreadiness to confront all forms and manifestations of\ninternational terrorism, including State-organized\nterror, in order to build a new world that guarantees\njustice, peace, security and freedom for all peoples \u2014 a\nnew world based on human rights and international\nlegality. We call on all nations to coordinate their\nefforts within the framework of the United Nations and\ninternational legality and the need to pursue and\nencourage a dialogue between all nations, religions and\ncivilizations.\nI would like to express my deepest appreciation\nto President George W. Bush for the declaration\ncontained in the statement he made yesterday with\nregard to the need to achieve a just peace based on the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and on the basis of\na two-State solution \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 and with\nregard to expeditiously resuming the peace process.\nFor our part, we will exert every possible effort to\nachieve those objectives. We have worked to provide\nthe best possible conditions for that endeavour, and we\nwill continue to do so.\nI would also like to salute, and extend my\nappreciation to, all my brothers who have preceded me\nand clearly and eloquently made references to the\nquestion of the Palestinian people and their right to\nrealize their legitimate rights under international\nlegality.\nLast year I had the honour of addressing the\nUnited Nations Millennium Summit. Today I am once\nagain addressing the Assembly, bringing the pain of the\nPalestinian people and their just cause, which still\nawaits a just solution. As Members will recall, in 1947\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (III),\nwhich provided for the partition of Palestine into two\nStates \u2014 one Jewish and the other Palestinian. But the\nPalestinian State has still not been recognized by the\nUnited Nations. The Palestinian people faced\ntremendous historic injustice, and the majority of them\nwere uprooted from their homes and made refugees.\nThe Palestinian people continue to seek their\nrights to self-determination and return \u2014 rights that\ntoday form the backbone of all relevant Security\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions, the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, international\n33\n\nlaw and international humanitarian law and that should\nbe exercised on the Palestinian national soil. Members\nare aware that we have accepted the solution provided\nfor by international legality. Yes, we have accepted less\nthan 25 per cent of historic Palestine, while the General\nAssembly granted us almost 50 per cent of historic\nPalestine, as provided for in resolution 181 (III). On\nthis new approach, we went to the Madrid Peace\nConference, which was based on the principle of \u201cland\nfor peace\u201d and which had the objective of\nimplementing all relevant international resolutions\nrelated to Palestine, particularly Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) and\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) concerning the\nPalestinian refugees. Then we signed the Oslo\nAgreement at the White House in Washington, D.C., in\nthe presence of and witnessed by representatives of the\nUnited States of America, the Russian Federation, the\nEuropean Union, China, Japan, Egypt, Jordan and other\ncountries, including Arab, African, Asian and Latin\nAmerica States.\nLater we signed a number of agreements and\nmemorandums of understanding. After the\nassassination of my late partner, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin \u2014\nmy partner in the peace process \u2014 consecutive Israeli\nGovernments clearly took the path of non-compliance\nand did not implement Israel\u2019s obligations stemming\nfrom the signed agreements. This impeded our sincere\nefforts to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting\npeace \u2014 the peace of the brave. The number of\nsettlements and settlers has doubled since the start of\nthe peace process. This reflects the lack of seriousness\nof the Israeli Government and its lack of commitment\nto the agreements signed between us.\nThen came Sharon\u2019s visit to the holy sanctuary in\nHoly Jerusalem. I had personally and officially warned\nthe Israeli Government of the grave consequences that\nwould have on the peace process and the region. This\naction sparked the Palestinian intifada, reflecting the\nrejection by the Palestinian people of the Israeli\nGovernment\u2019s non-compliance with the agreements\nsigned, the settlement policies, which deepen the\noccupation rather than end it by withdrawing from the\noccupied Palestinian territory, and its policies of\nundermining our Christian and Muslim Holy Places.\nThe current Israeli Government continues the\naggression against the Palestinian people begun by the\nprevious Government. State terror is being practised\nagainst the Palestinian people and land, using the might\nof the Israeli army, including F-15s, F-16s, Apache\nhelicopters, tanks, missiles, armoured vehicles, navy\nvessels and lethal weapons, including those that are\ninternationally banned. Practices of the Israeli army\nalso include the assassination of Palestinian political\nleaders, the demolition of homes, the destruction of\nprivate and government institutions, ruining farms and\nfields and uprooting hundreds of thousands of olive\nand fruit trees, as well as the killing of women,\nchildren and the elderly. There have been\napproximately 1,800 Palestinians killed and 37,000\nwounded. Many of them have been handicapped for\nlife. Thousands have been arrested in only 13 months.\nIt should also be noted that the Palestinian\neconomy has been devastated. The losses amount to\n$7 billion as a result of all forms of economic,\nfinancial, medical and food closures and sieges\nimposed on all the Palestinian cities, villages and\nrefugee camps. These practices continue to restrict the\nmovement of goods and people, including students and\nteachers who are prevented from reaching their schools\nand universities. All these acts of closure and siege\nhave recently been tightened. Our international\nborders, checkpoints and airports have been closed. All\nthese measures violate outright basic human rights.\nWorkers have also been prevented from reaching their\nwork places, their means to sustain their families and\nchildren.\nFacing this aggression, escalation and the bloody\nwar of State terror being waged by the Israeli\nGovernment against our people, land, Holy Places, \u2014\nJerusalem in particular \u2014 and Bethlehem, Beit Jala,\nHebron and other Palestinian towns, the incursion into\nour cities, villages and refugee camps with tanks and\nthe brutal massacres committed in various locations in\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip, we call on the\ninternational community, as represented by all present,\nand on the peace-, freedom- and justice-loving people\nwho defend human rights and dignity throughout the\nworld to work sincerely and resolutely and to exert all\npossible efforts to stop this war of aggression and to\nsend international observers to protect our people from\nthe occupation, terror and ethnic cleansing practised by\nIsrael and to supervise the implementation and the\nconsolidation of the ceasefire, by which we are abiding\nand which has been consistently violated by the Israeli\nGovernment.\nInternational sponsorship of the Middle East\npeace process is the only true guarantee for efforts by\n34\n\nthe international community to make peace an\nestablished reality in our region. The absence of\ninternational involvement in this conflict \u2014 in the\nserious search for a solution to the Palestinian question,\nin accordance with justice and the principles of\ninternational law \u2014 will push the region back into a\nspiral of violence, confrontation and bloodshed and\ncould make the situation more explosive and fragile.\nTherefore, I call upon the international\ncommunity to redouble its sincere efforts to end the\ncurrent situation and the escalating crisis that, in the\nabsence of the peace process, threatens to explode,\nwith grave consequences for our region. The active\ninvolvement of the international community and the\ninfluential Great Powers is essential to save the peace\nprocess and to put it back on the right track, to move it\nforward sincerely, resolutely and effectively. Lasting\npeace will not be achieved or sustained without\ninternational legality to provide an effective and\nbinding international mechanism to implement the\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly\nresolutions. The accurate and honest implementation of\nthese resolutions will establish and sustain peace and\nwill prevent bloodshed in our region.\nProceeding from our belief in peace as an\nirreversible strategic choice of our people, we have\ncooperated fully and positively with all international\nefforts and initiatives, including the Egyptian-\nJordanian initiative, the Tenet Understandings and the\nMitchell Report, which we accepted as a\ncomprehensive, integrated package. We have also\nunilaterally declared an immediate comprehensive\nceasefire, and we have exerted maximum efforts to\nsustain that ceasefire. On the eve of the Jewish New\nYear, we initiated the Palestinian call for peace, offered\nour sincere congratulations to the Israeli people and\ncalled upon them to make the New Year an occasion\nfor a new era of peace, security and peaceful\ncoexistence between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples\nand the peoples of the whole Middle East region. We\nmade very clear and unequivocal our strategic\ncommitment to peace, negotiations and the political\nsolution to all outstanding issues between us and the\nGovernment of Israel.\nMost regrettably, the Israeli Government\ninstructed its war generals and army to escalate the\nmilitary campaign against our people, cities, villages\nand refugee camps. This included the buffer zones and\nthe siege that closed off wide areas of cities, villages\nand cultivated lands and led to the destruction of our\nfarms and the uprooting of thousands of trees in\nvarious places in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nAllow me to extend my deepest appreciation and\nto salute sincerely all the brotherly, friendly nations\nand to the Great Powers that have realized today, more\nthan ever before, that the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State, with Holy Jerusalem as\nits capital, is the only guarantee for peace, security and\nstability in the region and the world. This constitutes a\nbasic cornerstone in establishing and sustaining that\npeace.\nWe call upon these nations, particularly the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, the Russian\nFederation, France, China, Japan, the members of the\nEuropean Union and the non-aligned countries, the\ninternational community, individually and collectively,\nto exert every possible effort to translate this vision\ninto action and political reality in order to enable the\nPalestinian people to live in peace, dignity, freedom,\nindependence and sovereignty within their independent\nState on their national soil, with Holy Jerusalem as its\ncapital. This can be achieved by bringing Israel, the\noccupying Power, to withdraw fully from all of the\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including\nHoly Jerusalem, to the boundaries of 4 June 1967, in\naccordance with the principles of the Madrid Peace\nConference, to end settlement activities and evacuate\nsettlers from our land, and to guarantee the right of\nreturn to the Palestinian refugees, in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III), which provided\nfor this right and called for compensation to those not\nwishing to return.\nWe welcome the positive positions taken by\nPresident George W. Bush and other leaders who have\ncalled for the establishment of a Palestinian State. We\nbelieve this constitutes a significant step towards\nending the conflict and establishing peace in the\nMiddle East. I will say candidly to you that reviving\nand completing the peace process will need a new\nqualitative push, and after all that has happened it will\nnot be possible to confine ourselves to interim\nsolutions. It is impossible, of course, to achieve another\ninterim agreement, as called for by some. To control\nthe situation on the ground and to get the situation back\nto the way it existed before 28 September 2000\nrequires clear political imagination and new hope.\n35\n\nWhat the peace process now requires to achieve a\njust and lasting peace is a genuine effort on the part of\nthe co-sponsors of the peace process \u2014 the United\nStates and the Russian Federation \u2014 as well as\ninfluential international actors, including the European\nUnion, and of course the Arab and Muslim countries\nand other friendly nations in the Non-Aligned\nMovement as well as in the United Nations. All of\nthem should immediately introduce a comprehensive\nframework for a permanent final solution based on\ninternational legality and the agreements signed so that\nboth parties can negotiate expeditiously the details of\nthat permanent solution. This, of course, should be\npreceded by the full and immediate implementation of\nthe Mitchell Report and the Tenet Understandings.\nIt is clear that we are in need of greater\ninternational efforts, including an international\npresence on the ground, to help the parties move\nforward. In any case, the United Nations and the\nSecretary-General must carry out their natural and\nimportant roles in this regard so that we can achieve\nour desired peace objectives. I call upon the Israeli\nGovernment and the Israeli people to respond\npositively to this approach so that we can together\nbuild peace in the land of peace, the Holy Land of\npeace \u2014 the Holy Land; I repeat, the Holy Land.\nNeedless to say, we need an expeditious effort\nthat brooks no further delay, especially at the current\ninternational situation. We are ready to carry out our\nshare of responsibility. We trust you are also ready to\nshoulder your share of responsibility. I realize that the\ninternational community, after the assassination of my\npartner, Yitzhak Rabin, is looking forward to the peace\nprocess. From here I convey to the Israeli people my\nfull commitment to the peace process, which I began\nwith my late partner Yitzhak Rabin, and my partner\nShimon Peres, a peace that guarantees freedom,\nstability and security for the Israelis and the\nPalestinians and all the peoples in the Middle East\nregion \u2014 the peace of the brave; the just and\ncomprehensive and lasting peace that will end the\nIsraeli occupation of all the Palestinian and Arab\nterritories and will lead to the establishment of the\nindependent Palestinian State with Holy Jerusalem as\nits capital.\nThis is what we should be working for, for the\nsake of our children and their children. From here I call\nupon the Israeli Government to resume the final status\nnegotiations in order to implement the resolutions of\ninternational legality and the agreements signed.\nI salute all of you and hope that this session will\nproduce the required solutions and recommendations\nwhich will enable our peoples and our nations and the\nwhole of humanity to live in peace, stability, progress\nand prosperity.\nMay peace and God\u2019s blessing be with you."

Allow me also to pay\na well deserved tribute to Mr. Harri Holkeri, President\nof the fifty-fifth session, and to commend him for\nspearheading efforts to reform and revitalize the\nGeneral Assembly, with a view to strengthening its role\nas the chief deliberative policy-making and\nrepresentative body of the United Nations.\nWe congratulate our Secretary-General for\nwinning the Nobel Peace Prize and for his\nreappointment as head of the Organization. This will\nno doubt enable him to continue his efforts to make the\nUnited Nations more relevant in facing today\u2019s\nchallenges. We commend him for continuing to place\nsuch a high premium on the need for the Organization\nto develop better tools for conflict prevention,\nmanagement and resolution and encourage him to\n6\n\ncontinue developing concepts and strategic frameworks\nfor the Organization\u2019s activities in the areas of conflict\nprevention and peace-building.\nWe particularly wish to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his relentless efforts and commitment to\nreforming and transforming the United Nations into a\nfunctioning Organization with a new management\nculture. We reiterate the view shared by many in this\nAssembly that the United Nations would be more\ndemocratic if the Security Council were made more\nrepresentative of the membership as a whole.\nRegrettably, while we all agree on the need for reform,\nagreement on the details for such reform continues to\nelude us.\nLesotho reiterates its unequivocal condemnation\nof the barbaric acts of terror committed against\ninnocent civilians on 11 September and extends its\ncondolences to the relatives of all those who perished\nduring the attacks. Ideological or other differences are\nno excuse for such unspeakable acts; neither can such\nevil acts be justified on the grounds of expediency.\nThose responsible for these acts must be punished.\nWhile we support the international coalition against\nterrorism and consider ourselves part thereof, we\nnevertheless stress the need for capacity-building to\nenable all countries effectively to play their part in\ncombating this menace.\nOne year after the unprecedented Millennium\nSummit is now a good time for us to reflect and take\nstock of how we are responding to the challenges and\nchanges brought about by our ever growing\ninterdependence and the ever-increasing\ninterconnectedness of our economies. In this changing\nworld in which all forms of economic, social, cultural\nand political activity have become dependent on access\nto telecommunications and information services\nprovided by the global information infrastructure, what\nprogress have we made towards making globalization\ntruly global and ensuring that people everywhere share\nin its benefits?\nThe truth of the matter is that there remains a\ngaping digital chasm between the industrialized and the\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa where the\nmajority of the people are yet to reap the benefits of\ninformation and communications technology. Much\nstill needs to be done to jump-start the introduction of\ninformation and communications technology in\nprimary schools in order to enable the developing\ncountries to respond to the changing needs of society\nand the economy.\nThe United Nations system thus has to redouble\nits efforts in assisting developing countries, particularly\nin Africa, in building their capacity in curriculum\ndevelopment to ensure improvements in the quality of\neducation and access to information and\ncommunications technology, including through the\ntransfer of technology. We thus call upon all\ninternational partners to treat information and\ncommunications technology as a special priority for\nAfrica\u2019s development.\nDespite the many difficulties that the developing\ncountries continue to face in addressing their urgent\ndevelopment needs, solid progress is being made\ntowards establishing strong institutional capacities for\nsustainable development, including a sound\nmacroeconomic foundation, effective governance,\npeace and stability. Following many years of\nundemocratic military dictatorships and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in\nAfrica, the continent has begun to take bold steps to\nclimb out of the rut, and today strong winds of\ndemocracy continue to reverberate throughout. This\ndeepening of democratic principles has led Africans to\nshun all leaders who come to power through extra-\nconstitutional means. There is also a growing\nawareness within Africa that sustainable development\ncannot take place in the midst of actual or potential\nconflict and that armed conflict is retrogressive and\ninevitably destroys the achievements of many years of\nnational development; hence, conflict management is\nnow assuming greater importance in Africa.\nDevelopment is also beginning to take firm roots\nas many African countries formulate their development\nstrategies and pursue greater cooperative relations with\ntheir development partners. The key role played by the\nUnited Nations in helping to re-energize the\nmomentum for international partnership between, in\nparticular, the least developed countries and the\ninternational community will remain crucial for\naddressing poverty and sustainable development.\nAfrica is not only determined to overcome its\nproblems, but it is also determined to ensure that the\nfuture development of the continent is shaped and\ndesigned by Africans themselves. Many of the evils\nthat have continued to plague Africa, including\neconomic decline, internal unrest and civil wars,\nuncertainty, corruption and disintegration of States,\n7\n\nhave been major obstacles to the development and\nestablishment of viable societies in Africa. All this has\nmade us realize that the only way to achieve\nsustainable development for the continent is to ensure\nthat people live and work in stable conditions under the\nrule of law. Transforming the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) into the African Union should thus be\nseen as an important step that will pave the way for the\nestablishment of strong institutions endowed with\nnecessary powers and resources to enable them to\ndischarge their duties and responsibilities efficiently\nand effectively.\nIt is against this background that the launching of\nthe New African Initiative in Lusaka in July was also a\nturning point in Africa\u2019s efforts aimed at ensuring that\nappropriate Africa-wide and regional economic and\nsocial reforms are carried out with a view to\neradicating all social injustices. This African-owned\nand African-led economy-centred recovery programme\nand framework for action is a pragmatic vision of how\nAfrica wishes to be included as a partner and not as a\nrecipient of the benefits and opportunities offered by\nglobalization. This initiative by Africans, which sets\nout the right priorities and focal points for the\nsustainable development of the African continent,\ndeserves not only commendation, but also support from\nthis Assembly and the international community as a\nwhole.\nIn embarking on this new path to recovery,\nAfricans have no illusions. They are fully aware of the\nmammoth task that they have set for themselves and\nbelieve that progress towards achieving it will have to\nbe driven by the people and Governments of Africa\nthemselves. We will have to create the necessary\nconditions to allow the poor to become agents of\nchange, using their own talents and capacities to raise\ntheir production and increase their income.\nFor all that to happen, Africa needs resources.\nThe international community must provide support not\nonly through development cooperation, but also\nthrough improved trade access for African countries to\nthe markets of the developed world. The \u201cEverything\nbut Arms\u201d initiative adopted by the European Council\nof Ministers in February is a first important step\ntowards scrapping customs duties on imports from\nAfrica and other developing countries, and needs to be\nemulated. We express our gratitude for the support and\ncommitment already given to this initiative by the G-8\nand the European Union and call upon other donor\ncountries and agencies to join Africa as it embarks on\nits new path of recovery. In the same vein, we\nacknowledge the benefits that the African Growth and\nOpportunity Act holds for sub-Saharan African\ncountries.\nThe Millennium Summit reaffirmed the\nCopenhagen World Summit for Social Development\ngoal of reducing by half the number of people living in\nextreme poverty by 2015. Despite that, abject poverty,\na narrow resource base and, hence, broad dependence\non overseas development aid, unsustainable levels of\ndebt and the deleterious effects of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic continue to be part of everyday reality for\nthe majority of the people in the world. In some\nregions of sub-Saharan Africa poverty has actually\nincreased, posing a serious threat to democratic\ngovernance processes through the erosion of human\nrights and human dignity, as well as the deterioration of\nthe already narrow natural resource base. In addition,\nthe number of least developed countries has more than\ndoubled since 1971, when the United Nations set up\nthat category of countries.\nA more rapid and sustainable exit from debt is\nthus imperative. This calls for urgent implementation\nof an enhanced and expanded Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Debt Initiative (HIPC). It further calls for\nmore comprehensive measures, including converting\nthe remaining bilateral debts of the least developed\ncountries into grants, widening HIPC to benefit more\ncountries, increasing the levels of official development\nassistance, ensuring markets for the products of least\ndeveloped countries and encouraging greater volumes\nof foreign direct investment to Africa.\nLesotho therefore looks forward to further\ndiscussion of these measures during the coming\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, the convening of which we fully\nsupport. We also believe that the Programme of Action\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade\n2001-2010 is a benchmark framework for accelerating\nthe sustained economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment of the poorest and weakest segment of the\ninternational community.\nHousing remains a critical pillar of sustainable\neconomic development. It is the single most important\nand obvious indicator of individual aspirations and\ntheir fulfilment. Testimony to this is the renewal of our\ncommitment, earlier this year, to the principles of the\n8\n\nHabitat Agenda, which are encapsulated in the ideas of\nadequate shelter for all and sustainable human\nsettlements for development. Poverty continues to be a\nmajor factor for developing countries\u2019 failure to realize\nthese twin goals of the Habitat Agenda.\nIn the same vein, a healthy population is an\nabsolute requirement for social and economic\ndevelopment. We thus recognize the enormous\nchallenges posed by HIV/AIDS and other infectious\ndiseases. For Africa, which is host to 70 per cent of the\npeople infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, this\nscourge is reversing hard-won gains in economic and\nsocial development. Political commitment and\nleadership are therefore essential for building national\ncapacities to develop and implement comprehensive\nnational strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention, care,\nsupport and treatment, all of which require\nmobilization of resources. We therefore welcome the\noutcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS held\nduring the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly,\nand hope that the Global AIDS and Health Fund\nannounced by the Secretary-General will soon become\noperational to provide funding on a grant basis to the\nmost affected countries.\nLesotho welcomes the global movement to ensure\nthat every child enjoys a better beginning, and hence a\nbetter future, and has undertaken to renew its\ncommitment to ensure the rights of children. Our most\nauspicious endeavour to that end was the progressive\nintroduction, in the year 2000, of free primary\neducation beginning with standard 1 pupils. We believe\nthat this is a step forward in ensuring sustained\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The new\nagreed dates for the postponed children\u2019s summit\nshould ensure that we do not lose the momentum for\ncreating a better world for children.\nLesotho also remains keenly aware of the\nimportant role that women play in the advancement of\nthe nation\u2019s social and economic development\nprocesses, as well as of the need to sustain their\ninvolvement and participation at all levels. To that end,\nwe have heeded the call to States parties to the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women that have entered\nreservations to the Convention to review those\nreservations. Our own reservation to the Convention\nhas been amended with a view to withdrawing it at a\nlater stage.\nThe events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,\nas well as the gruesome images of women and children\nwhose limbs were hacked off by rebel forces in Sierra\nLeone, have shown that accountability for genocide,\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity, and universal\njurisdiction over those crimes, are key to bringing an\nend to the cycle of impunity that we have witnessed\nover the years. Lesotho\u2019s tangible contribution towards\nending the culture of impunity is demonstrated by its\nsupport and assistance to the activities of the\nInternational Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda\naimed at bringing those responsible for the most\negregious crimes to justice, as well as its support for\nthe creation of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, for\nwhich Lesotho has pledged $100,000 over three years.\nThe first payment of $40,000 in respect of the first year\nhas already been deposited. We call on the international\ncommunity to provide adequate funding in order that\nthe Special Court for Sierra Leone may come into\noperation.\nWhile the pace of ratifications for the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court is encouraging, more\nneeds to be done if that Court is to become a reality\nsoon. Adequate time and resources should therefore be\nmade available for the Preparatory Commission to\nfulfil its mandate within the first half of 2002.\nInternational peace and security continue to be a\nmajor challenge for the United Nations in the twenty-\nfirst century. While some positive developments have\nbeen recorded on various issues that are critical to the\nsecurity of the international community, much more\nstill needs to be done in pursuit of a more peaceful\nworld \u2014 a world free from weapons of mass\ndestruction; a world free from the arsenals of illicit\nsmall arms and light weapons; and a world with\nstrengthened global norms for nuclear non-proliferation\nand disarmament.\nWe renew our call to those who remain outside\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (NPT) to join the Treaty, and urge the\nnuclear-weapon States to continue full compliance with\nobligations assumed under the Treaty.\nThe recent spate of biowarfare threats have also\nheightened the urgent need to devise effective\ncompliance measures that will make the proliferation\nof biological weapons much harder and prevent such\nweapons from falling into the hands of terrorist groups.\n9\n\nThe historic United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects has succeeded in highlighting the human\nsuffering and insecurity engendered by the excessive\naccumulation and illicit transfer of those weapons.\nThough not fully satisfactory, particularly to those of\nus who have suffered most from this scourge, the\nmeasures envisaged in the Programme of Action are a\nhistoric first step towards curbing this menace. It is\nnow up to all of us to forge meaningful partnerships to\nensure effective implementation of the Programme as\nwe move together to free the world of these weapons.\nWhile peace has continued to hold in many\nregions of the world, Africa has experienced setbacks\nin that regard, as violent conflicts have continued\nunabated. The sad legacy of our colonial past, wherein\nState-sponsored activities facilitated the systematic\nplunder of Africa\u2019s resources, have been replaced by\nforeign companies and individuals in pursuit of the so-\ncalled bottom line, whose sole motive is the\nmaximization of profit. The link between conflicts, the\neasy availability of arms, an abundance of natural\nresources and the greed of these individuals have\ntotally devalued African lives. In other words, the\nworth of African lives in the year 2001 is much the\nsame as during the time of slavery in the nineteenth\ncentury. We call upon the same collective conscience\nof the international community that condemned and\nsucceeded in eradicating slavery to speak with equal\nvehemence against this evil in our time.\nThe volatile and explosive situation in the Middle\nEast remains highly regrettable. Lesotho supports the\ncreation of an independent Palestinian State on the\nbasis of Security Council resolutions, a State that\nshould coexist in peace with its neighbours.\nWe call on all parties to conflicts around the\nworld to intensify efforts to create conditions\nconducive to the implementation of the agreements\nreached and relevant Security Council resolutions, as\nwell as to the effective engagement of the United\nNations. We are encouraged by the developments in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Sierra\nLeone, and applaud the efforts of all parties to bring\npeace to their countries.\nWe are, however, saddened by the lack of\nprogress in the implementation of agreements relating\nto the settlement, once and for all, of two of the largest\nrunning conflicts, in Angola and the Saharan Arab\nDemocratic Republic. We in Lesotho are convinced\nthat the Houston accords remain the foundation for\nself-determination in the latter, while, undoubtedly, the\nLusaka Protocol on Angola remains the only viable\nbasis for peace in that sisterly country.\nIn conclusion, Lesotho renews its commitment to\nmultilateral cooperation and the principles enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter. The current difficult times\ncall for the strong support of the United Nations and\nthe multilateral processes if the Organization is to\neffectively address the new global issues and\nchallenges that confront it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe understand that an\nAmerican Airlines flight to the Dominican Republic\nhas gone down in Queens. We extend the condolences\nand the support of my Government to the United States\nand the Dominican Republic.\nThat we have forged ahead with the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly and that political\nleaders have assembled for the general debate mark an\nextraordinary accomplishment, one that brings great\ncredibility to the United Nations. I applaud and thank\nall who reside in this great city for continuing their\nwork. Today, more than ever, our efforts and energies\nshould focus on implementing the purposes and\nprinciples of our Charter and should inspire hope and\nconfidence in all humanity.\nForeign Minister Han Seung-soo, on behalf of my\ndelegation, I extend congratulations to him on his\nelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of the\nAssembly. The manner in which he has guided our\nwork thus far is outstanding and worthy of our\nrecognition. We wish him continued success as he\npresides over this Assembly. To the Secretary-General\nand to the United Nations, we extend congratulations\non being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nBefore I proceed, please allow me, on behalf of\nthe Belizean people, to extend to the President and the\npeople of the United States of America, especially to\nthe people of New York City, our heartfelt condolences\non the tremendous loss suffered on 11 September.\nFor most of us, the immediate reaction to this\ntragedy was one of shock and disbelief. As we joined\nin mourning the loss of innocent lives, including some\nof our own nationals, the international community\nmoved swiftly to adopt a number of resolutions here at\nthe United Nations. Through these actions we\nforcefully condemned acts of terrorism and reached out\nto the United States of America in solidarity, firm in\nour support to uphold the principles of justice and the\nmaintenance of peace.\nToday, despots feast in the raging rivers of\ndesperation, seeking refuge among the weak, preying\nupon the vulnerabilities of the less fortunate. Those\nwho are caught in the sweeping currents of poverty,\nforced to live in a world were a dollar is a luxury, find\nlittle hope for a better future and are often abused by\nthose who manipulate them for selfish and destructive\nreasons. For us, securing a better future for the millions\n15\n\nwho live in poverty continues to be our most noble of\nchallenges.\nTo meet this challenge, the United Nations must\nremain true to its task as set forth in the Charter and\nreaffirmed just over a year ago when our heads of State\nand Government gathered here and adopted the\nMillennium Declaration. That Declaration outlines\nvarious issues critical to the realization of a world with\nless poverty, death and despair, exhorting the values of\nfreedom, equality, justice and tolerance. We must not\nallow the events of 11 September to cause us to lose\nour focus on this righteous undertaking \u2014 we must\nstay the course.\nFor Belize, the path to fulfilling the goals of the\nMillennium Declaration begins with addressing the\nissues of development and poverty eradication. We\nconfirm our support for the Agenda for Development.\nAs a small State working to provide greater\nopportunities for its people, especially those who live\nin poverty, meaningful sustainable development is\ncritical and can be achieved only through partnership\nwith the international community. Regional and global\ncooperation are fundamental components for progress\nand necessitate a universal acceptance of our shared\nresponsibility to create opportunities for growth and\ndevelopment. Please allow me to say a few words in\nSpanish.\n(spoke in Spanish)\nGlobalization amply demonstrates our\ninterdependence and the importance of cooperation\nwith the rest of the world based on the principle of\nmutual respect. Genuine sustainable development\nrequires inclusive and transparent trading practices that\nallow for the participation of developing countries in\nthe global economy. The geographical location of\nBelize enables us to participate in the Caribbean\nCommunity and the Central American Integration\nSystem, which gives us the opportunity to offer\ndifferent perspectives in the fight against poverty. At\nthe same time, it increases our possibilities for greater\nparticipation in all entities concerned with developing\ninnovative mechanisms to efficiently integrate our\neconomies into the global economic system. In this\nrespect, we consider that equitable and participatory\ncooperation in which our concerns and vulnerabilities\nwill receive the attention they deserve is fundamental.\n(spoke in English)\nThe twenty-sixth special session of the General\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS, held last June, brought the\ninternational community together to collectively affirm\nthe urgent need for critical action on the part of all\nstakeholders to combat this pandemic. For us in the\nCaribbean, the Conference was of special importance.\nRanked the second highest region in rate of HIV/AIDS\ninfection after sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean States\nare working with their international partners to combat\nthe spread of this deadly disease. Any progress made\nduring the HIV/AIDS special session must be\nattributed to the collaborative spirit displayed by all\nthose involved, at both the political and technical\nlevels. The inclusion of civil society, as well as the\nprivate sector, contributed to the effectiveness of the\nconference and remains critical to the success of any\nprogramme to eradicate HIV/AIDS. We welcome the\ndecision of the Secretary-General to reach out to the\nentire world community to assist in the establishment\nof the Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fund, in an effort\nto help alleviate the suffering of the millions of people\nafflicted by the scourge.\nThe protection and preservation of our\nenvironment is a major concern to the developing\nworld, as so many of us depend on our natural\nresources for our survival. The commitments made by\nthe international community for the protection of the\nenvironment have not been implemented, and if they\nare not addressed urgently, the consequences will\nimpact negatively our small dependent economies, as\nwell as the economy of the global community. We\nattach great importance to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and\nwelcome the successful results of the recently\nconcluded meeting in Marrakech, hoping to see more\nStates ratify the Kyoto Protocol.\nIn the Central America and the Caribbean regions\nwe perpetually suffer from the effects of natural\ndisasters, with the number and intensity of hurricanes\nincreasing over the last decade. This has been\nattributed to the effects of climate change caused by\nglobal warming. For two consecutive years, Belize has\nbeen struck by category-four hurricanes, magnifying\nthe need to protect our environment and minimize our\nvulnerabilities. It is imperative that we gear our efforts\ntowards creating the necessary mechanisms to reverse\nand curtail negative actions that contribute to the\ndeterioration of the state of our environment. For this\n16\n\nreason, Belize, along with its partners in the Caribbean\nregion, continues to seek the support of the United\nNations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea.\nIf we are to speak of shared responsibility for\ndevelopment and the maintenance of peace and\nsecurity, this year especially we must ensure that\neveryone be allowed to participate in this global forum.\nIn this light, we continue to appeal to this Organization\nto consider the right of the 23 million people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and allow their voices to\nbe heard in this world institution. Equally, we must\ncontinue to advocate recognition of the Palestinian\npeople\u2019s right to self-determination, including the right\nto their independent State.\nWith respect to our commitment to the\ndevelopment of peace and security, Belize is pleased to\nreport the continuation of dialogue with our neighbour,\nthe Republic of Guatemala. We continue to support all\nefforts to peacefully resolve our differences.\nThis year has been designated the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. The recently\nconcluded debate on this agenda item produced\nmeaningful discussion on the advantages of diversity\nand its benefits to human progress. Enhanced by\nglobalization, our actions impact others immediately,\ncreating new realities that require more openness and\ngreater sensitivity to the differences among us. In our\ncountry, where seven languages or dialects are spoken\nand diverse ethnic populations live together peacefully,\nmy delegation welcomes the prospect of increased\ndialogue among civilizations, one inclusive of all\npeoples, that will improve upon the understanding of\nwho we are and where we came from. The Secretary-\nGeneral, in his report on the United Nations Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations, noted the importance of\nensuring that the process of globalization be\ncomprehensive and fair. Let us grasp the opportunity\ngiven to us through this process to work together as\nequal partners in this global community, seeking to\nunderstand our common objectives while respecting\nour differences.\nThe Millennium Declaration recognizes the\nexisting inequalities in our world. Likewise, it offers a\ncomprehensive formula for greater prosperity for all. It\ndirects us towards a collective responsibility through\ngreater partnership among the countries of the world.\nAt this time, when we are faced with new global\nrealities, let us make this Declaration meaningful by\naccelerating our efforts to achieve the just objectives of\nlasting peace and prosperity for all of our peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to congratulate the\nPresident on his election to head the first session of the\nGeneral Assembly of the new millennium. I am certain\nthat his experience and commitment will enable us to\nachieve the high goals that we all share. I also renew\nthe Italian Government\u2019s warmest congratulations to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on his receipt of the\nNobel Peace Prize. His appointment to a second term to\nthe leadership of the United Nations is both welcome\nand unanimously appreciated.\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium\naddressed the General Assembly yesterday, speaking\non behalf of the European Union. Italy fully shares his\nviews and supports his statement.\nLike our Belgian colleague and previous\nspeakers, I would like to express once more, on this\nsolemn occasion, to the Government and people of the\nUnited States our deep solidarity following the\nappalling terrorist acts perpetrated against them. We\nshare their suffering over the shocking loss of human\nlife and the sorrow of thousands of families.\n25\n\nThese acts defy the most basic values of civil\ncoexistence. We condemn them and reaffirm our full\ncommitment to the fight against international terrorism,\na struggle on which the United Nations has conferred\nfull legitimacy. We believe that the United Nations\nremains the central forum to which we must turn in\ndrafting a comprehensive response to terrorism.\nThis is why we need strict application of the full\nrange of measures adopted by the General Assembly\nand the Security Council during the days immediately\nfollowing the 11 September attacks. Resolution 1373\n(2001), in particular, must be implemented, urgently\nand vigorously. I also hope that everyone shows the\nnecessary flexibility to allow a swift conclusion of the\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention against\ninternational terrorism.\nOn 7 November, by a majority of more than 90\nper cent, the Italian Parliament approved the\nGovernment\u2019s decision to contribute ground troops,\nnaval forces and air units to operations against\ninternational terrorism. This confirms my country\u2019s\nawareness that the stakes are high and proves the\nrobustness of our national consensus in facing this\nchallenge. The fight must be conducted in a targeted\nmanner, avoiding the loss of innocent lives, until the\nobjective has been fully achieved, without, however,\nneglecting humanitarian assistance to the Afghan\npeople, both within the country and in the refugee\ncamps. But the problem of the political future of\nAfghanistan, a problem to be solved only by the\nAfghan people, must, of course, remain a high priority\nin the agenda of the United Nations, together with the\nobjective of regional stability.\nBut in crafting a credible, diversified global\nstrategy to eradicate international terrorism, we must\nalso search for solutions to the most delicate regional\ncrises and to the global problems that loom over our\nlives. These include hunger, poverty, ignorance,\ninequality, underdevelopment, violation of human\nrights and fundamental freedoms and threats to the\nenvironment and health.\nAt the top of the list of regional crises is the\nMiddle East, an area physically close to Italy, and one\nto which we pay close attention. Here, we are working\nboth in a national capacity and within the European\nUnion to create, as soon as possible, the conditions for\nan end to the violence and a true return to negotiations\nfor a comprehensive, lasting peace in the region based\non the establishment of a viable and democratic State\nfor the Palestinians and an end to the occupation of\ntheir territories and on Israel\u2019s right to live in peace\nand security within internationally recognized borders.\nThis framework should also include an ambitious\nplan, like the one adopted to rebuild a devastated\nEurope in the wake of World War II, for public and\nprivate investments and inter-regional assistance\ntowards fostering solidarity among the region\u2019s States\nand peoples \u2014 in other words, a new Marshall Plan.\nSpecial attention should be paid to the economic and\nsocial growth and development of the Palestinian\npopulation, to which Italy is fully committed and for\nwhich it remains prepared to do more in the future.\nIn the Balkans, we have noted encouraging\nprogress despite persisting tensions. Our goal there is\nto prevent destabilizing tendencies and to foster\nregional cooperation and economic development,\nincluding closer ties with the European Union.\nAs for the challenges of globalization, we should\nfirst of all make the success of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha a\nprimary objective. In fact, many of the global problems\nI have listed can be alleviated by ensuring that the\ninternational market economy and multilateral free\ntrade operate fairly and continue to foster\ninclusiveness, integration and more equitable and\nsustainable growth of all countries through agreed\nrules. This latest WTO round should be one of growth\nand development, focusing in particular on the\nproblems of the developing and least developed\ncountries.\nBut in order to assure a better response to\nglobalization\u2019s most problematic aspects, other major\nobjectives must be pursued. And the universal\norganization with the moral authority to meet this\nchallenge is the United Nations.\nThe first objective is the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Italy\u2019s commitment is\nstrong and long-standing. In fact, we are one of the top\nthree contributors of men and resources to peace\noperations led and authorized by the United Nations. In\nthis light, we appreciate the reports that the Secretariat\nhas issued in the past two years, which suggest a vision\nof peace activity as a single, three-sided concept,\nencompassing conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\npost-conflict peace-building.\n26\n\nItaly also values the document that the Secretary-\nGeneral submitted to Member States on the prevention\nof armed conflicts, emphasizing the direct connection\nbetween safeguarding peace and fighting\nunderdevelopment. In fact, no peacekeeping action can\nachieve lasting results unless it is coupled with\nmeasures to strengthen government institutions,\nsafeguard the human, civil and cultural rights of all\ncommunities and rebuild the economic and social fibre\nof affected areas.\nThe second objective is to foster development and\neradicate poverty. We must ensure that all the countries\nof the world benefit from the opportunities created by\ninterdependencies and progress, in particular in the\nareas of information and communication technology.\nThe global United Nations conferences of the 1990s\nlaid the groundwork for the definition of poverty as a\nmultidimensional phenomenon. It is not only\ncharacterized by low income and consumption, but also\na lack of food, health care, schooling and\nenvironmental stability. This is a vicious cycle that we\nmust break, through coordinated and integrated\ninitiatives. To reverse the downward spiral, we must\nenhance both the material and the human dimensions of\ndevelopment.\nThe Millennium Declaration spells out the\nobjectives to be attained by 2015. Italy has shown its\ncommitment to these goals through the shaping of its\ninternational actions and the shouldering of its\nresponsibilities during the year of its G-8 presidency.\nOne example was the substantive outreach initiative at\nthe Genoa Summit, involving a meeting with five\nAfrican Heads of State and the Secretary-General to\ndiscuss the New African Initiative and launch a global\nfund to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious\ndiseases.\nFinally, we must continue to nurture and\nstrengthen development assistance and reach the goal\nof having the most developed countries dedicate 0.7\nper cent of their gross national product to this pursuit.\nIn this context, debt relief is another essential tool to\nfree up the necessary resources in developing countries\nin order to stimulate their economies, for instance by\npromoting public investment in health care and\nschooling. Italy is a leader in this field by virtue of\nrecent laws that allow it to gradually cancel the debt of\nthe poorest countries.\nAs I said before, the United Nations has the moral\nauthority to take on today\u2019s new challenges. This fact\nwas highlighted by the awarding of the Nobel Peace\nPrize to the Secretary-General and to the Organization\nas a whole. However, its structure and procedures must\nkeep pace with the times. Italy believes in the reform\nof the United Nations, a reform that should affect all of\nits bodies, including the Security Council. Let me\nreiterate the need for a comprehensive reform that\naddresses the relevant issues in all their aspects. Such a\nreform should be designed to produce greater\nefficiency, legitimacy and transparency. It should also\nmeet the general expectations of democracy,\nuniversality and inclusiveness.\nIn addition, to create the conditions for stable\ngrowth of prosperity and security for all humankind,\nwe need more effective governance of globalization.\nThe documents prepared by the Secretariat make great\nstrides in this direction. Now is the time to translate the\ncommitments of the Millennium Declaration into\naction. Italy will support every initiative undertaken for\nthis purpose.\nNever have we had a better opportunity to solve\nour problems, yet never have we faced greater risks.\nThe answer does not lie in denying the reality of\ninterdependence and growing globalization. It is within\nour ability to promote better governance of the\ninternational system. Never before has the world had so\nmany human, financial and technological resources at\nits disposal. The answer lies in our hands, in our\ncollective will.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\nstart by congratulating you, Mr. President, on behalf of\nmy Government and myself, on your election to the\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly.\nYour election is an acknowledgement of the many\ncontributions made by the Republic of Korea to United\nNations efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity, as well as to promote the economic and social\ndevelopment of our peoples.\nThis session is being held during a period of\nmajor challenges to our Organization and the\ninternational community in general.\nPeace and security continue to be endangered by\nmany armed conflicts, particularly in Africa, as well as\nby terrorist activities launched systematically or\nsporadically against some countries. Extreme poverty\nand misery still affect large numbers of the world\npopulation, especially in my continent, where one\nfourth of our 800 million inhabitants survive on less\nthan $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS epidemic, now\naffecting more than 36 million people, most of them\neconomically active people, may seriously threaten the\neconomic development and future of many societies\nunless urgent measures are taken.\nTo face these and many other challenges, the\nUnited Nations must continue to improve its internal\nstructure, including the Security Council, whose\nmembership must be reconsidered to allow for a more\nequitable geographic balance. In addition, its working\nmethods should be restructured to ensure effective\nimplementation of its decisions.\nThe United Nations must also endeavour to\nimplement the action plans and recommendations\nadopted over the last decade, with a view to resolving\nproblems in the areas of HIV/AIDS, social\ndevelopment, human rights, racism and racial\ndiscrimination, as well as terrorism.\nAt the last session of the General Assembly, my\nGovernment voted in favour of resolution 55/158, on\nmeasures to eliminate international terrorism. We\ncontinue to believe that its implementation will be\nessential to fighting this enemy. Terrorism is an\ninternational scourge with many faces. No country is\nimmune to this heinous evil, and to fight it, we must\ncooperate at the bilateral, regional and international\nlevels, under the leadership of the United Nations.\nAngola reiterates its firm condemnation of the 11\nSeptember terrorist attacks, which victimized\nthousands of innocent civilians and endorses the use of\nforce to eliminate terrorist networks and their support\nbases.\nHaving been subjected to terrorism for many\nyears, Angola is pleased to join all other States in this\nanti-terrorist campaign. In this context, we have joined\nthe other members of the Southern Africa Development\nCouncil to promote a forum to discus and identify the\nmany faces of terrorism, as well as effective means to\nprevent and fight its activities in and from our region.\nAs to the African continent, we believe measures\nto combat terrorism should particularly address its\nsources of financing, such as the illicit diamond, drug\nand weapons traffic, and identify its networks in order\nto prevent the free circulation of its members.\nIn partnership with some countries, Angola has\ndeveloped an international diamond certification\nsystem that has prevented diamonds originating from\nillegal traffic to reach international markets. Thus, we\nhave helped prevent the financing of terrorist groups\nand their activities in many countries of our continent.\nAt this stage, the struggle against terrorism\nrequires that, beyond the measures encompassed by\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), special\nattention be devoted to the completion of an\ninternational convention against terrorism. This legal\ninstrument could eliminate some of the ambiguities\nstill surrounding the definition of this phenomenon.\n23\n\nMy Government is firmly committed to peace in\nAngola, the African continent and the world as a\nwhole. After a period of uncertainty, peace is slowly\nbecoming an irreversible reality in Angola. The regular\nforces of UNITA\u2019s militarist wing, which had launched\na large-scale military campaign to seize power, have\nbeen completely neutralized. Counties under their\nillegal control have been liberated and the Angolan\nGovernment now controls the entire national territory.\nLarge numbers of rebel soldiers and officers\nsurrendering their weapons and being integrated into\nAngolan society is now a daily event. Today UNITA\u2019s\nmilitary wing has only small groups, inadequately\narmed in the jungle or in remote areas of our large\nterritory. Although they can make isolated armed\nattacks, they do not represent a threat anymore to\nAngolan democratic institutions or to the safety of\nmost of our population.\nMy Government believes that the Lusaka\nProtocol continues to be a valid formula for resolving\nproblems related to peace and national reconciliation in\nAngola.\nThe climate of peace that is starting to prevail is\nhaving favourable repercussions on the country\u2019s\neconomy. Although considerable distortions and\nweaknesses still exist, reform efforts under way can\nhelp overcome serious social problems and enable\ngeneral elections to be held in the near future in a truly\ndemocratic environment.\nAs a result of a long period of war, Angola still\nneeds the support of the international community in its\neffort to alleviate the problems of poverty, displaced\npersons and refugees, and to rebuild its infrastructure.\nThe environment of relative peace would not be\npossible without the help of the international\ncommunity, which has made the distinction between\nthose who are committed to peace and democracy and\nthe proponents of war, and has imposed Security\nCouncil sanctions against UNITA\u2019s militarist wing led\nby Jonas Savimbi. The most visible effect of these\nsanctions has been their contribution to a significant\nreduction of Savimbi\u2019s capacity to wage war and, as a\nresult, to persuade a great number of UNITA members\nto give up their weapons and join the peace effort.\nThat outcome clearly demonstrates the efficacy of\nthe sanctions as a means, and not as an end in\nthemselves. That is why my Government favours\nkeeping and tightening them until peace becomes\nirreversible in Angola. Nevertheless, my Government\nis still concerned with the findings of United Nations\nreports, according to which not all countries have fully\nadopted measures called for by the sanctions\nresolutions.\nThe Security Council resolutions on sanctions\nagainst UNITA were adopted in accordance with the\npowers given to the Council by the United Nations\nCharter. All nations are legally obligated to abide by\nand implement those resolutions. The resulting\nobligations on the Member States prevail over any\ninconsistent obligation to which they might be subject\nby virtue of any other treaty or international agreement\nto which they are, or may become, party. That principle\nshould also be applied with regard to sanctions against\nUNITA.\nThe Angolan Government considers inconsistent\nthe arguments put forward by certain Governments \u2014\nsome of which have a privileged relationship with\nAngola \u2014 of a supposed incompatibility between their\ninternal legislation and Security Council resolutions.\nWe appeal to those countries to reverse their position\nand to take the measures required. This, we believe,\nwill contribute to the development of harmonious\nbilateral relationships with Angola.\nAngola is firmly committed to a search for peace\nin the Great Lakes region, and particularly in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. We are pleased\nwith the positive results achieved lately by the peace\nprocess. In general terms, the ceasefire has been\nadhered to and foreign troops have been withdrawn.\nAngola, for example, has withdrawn 75 per cent of its\ntroops. Namibia has completed its withdrawal, and\nboth Zimbabwe and Uganda have started to repatriate\ntheir respective armies. Only Rwanda has not yet taken\nany step to signal its willingness to withdraw its forces,\nand therefore to fulfil its basic obligation as a signatory\nto the Lusaka Agreement and the obligations of the\npertinent resolutions of the Security Council. We are\nhopeful that proper preparation of the inter-Congolese\ndialogue will lead to a substantive discussion of the\nrelevant questions regarding the political future of the\ncountry.\nAs regards Burundi, Angola salutes the\nestablishment of a transitional Government, which is a\ndirect outcome of the Pretoria agreement, for which the\nmediation efforts of former President Nelson Mandela\n24\n\nwere so crucial. We hope this step will soon lead to\npeace and stability in Burundi and good-neighbourly\nrelations with bordering countries.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Angola thinks it\nis necessary to find a solution acceptable to both\nparties that makes it possible to overcome the barriers\nto the implementation of a plan to resolve the conflict.\nMy Government encourages the United Nations and the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to persist in their\nefforts in that direction.\nThe international community should not forget\nthe problems of Somalia. The establishment of a\nTransitional National Government is an important step\non the way to a peaceful resolution of the internal\nconflict there. Both the United Nations and the OAU\nshould support that step in order that Somalia can\nreturn to its rightful place in the community of nations.\nAngola is also concerned with the deterioration of\nthe peace process in the Middle East, which has\nresulted from the recent intensification of the violence.\nWe believe that a resolution of the conflict between\nIsrael and Palestine will require negotiations. We\ntherefore appeal to the parties to continue their\ndialogue and to abide by the agreements they signed\nand by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nAngola is pleased with the advances achieved by\nthe fraternal people of East Timor in their struggle for\nthe right to self-determination and independence. The\npolitical, moral and diplomatic support that Angola and\nother members of the international community have\nbeen providing through the years in major international\nforums was decisive in enabling the people of the\nterritory to reach a point where they can finally choose\ntheir destiny in freedom. The Timorese are now\npreparing to proclaim the birth of a new, independent,\nsovereign and democratic nation, but they will continue\nto need the support of the United Nations for the\nconsolidation of their institutions.\nThe international economic recession will have a\nmajor impact on developing countries, and on Africa in\nparticular, which has already suffered the effects of\nglobalization. Of course, African countries cannot\navoid globalization. But to engage in cooperative and\ncollective activities, African nations must be based in\nstrong States, something that hardly exists in the\ncontinent.\nIn the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development\n(NEPAD), the countries of the continent have found a\nway to break away from stagnation and to promote\ninter-African cooperation and achieve development.\nAngola is engaged in the New Partnership. Economic\nprogress can be achieved in Africa through the\npromotion of trade among its nations, the establishment\nof healthy economic conditions and good governance,\nfighting regional threats \u2014 including conflicts and\nendemic diseases \u2014 and welcoming capital inflows.\nWe hope that NEPAD will become a force for political\nstabilization and economic development in African\ncountries, particularly those affected by serious\ndivisions.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, must\nbe an opportunity to mobilize resources for\ndevelopment, particularly for the 49 least developed\ncountries, 34 of which are in Africa, and to alleviate\nthe extreme poverty under which more than 600\nmillion people are now living.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to express how deeply\nsaddened we are over the crash of the American\nAirlines aircraft a few hours ago, a few miles away\nfrom this Headquarters, in the borough of Queens in\nNew York City. Let me express our deep condolences\nto the families of the victims and to our friends in this\ncountry.\nI have the honour to convey to Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. His\nelection to this high office shows the high regard the\ninternational community has for him personally as well\nas for his friendly country, South Korea, with which\nmy country maintains good relations. We are confident\nthat thanks to his experience in international affairs the\nAssembly will achieve positive results, and we wish\nhim and his staff every success.\nLet me also extend my thanks to his predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the valuable efforts he exerted in\nconducting the work of the previous session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his re-\nelection for a second term to this high office and on\nbeing awarded, together with the United Nations\nOrganization, the Nobel Peace Prize. We would like to\nconvey to him our appreciation for his persistent\nefforts, which are bound to contribute to enabling the\nOrganization to accomplish its lofty mission of\nmaintaining international peace and security and\nachieving sustainable international development.\nThis session is being held at a very critical stage,\nwhen the United States of America has been subjected\nto the most horrific and dangerous forms of organized\n39\n\nterrorism that not only targeted the lives of thousands\nof innocent civilian men, women and children, but also\nthe moral codes and values underlying the human and\ncultural principles that are enshrined in the Charter, the\nnorms of international law and the foundations and\nconcepts of the legal, political, economic and social\ninstitutions that shape the nature of our international\nrelations as a whole.\nThe United Arab Emirates, which was deeply\nshocked after this reprehensible, immoral and criminal\nact, reiterates today its strong denunciation and\ncondemnation of these savage acts and all other forms\nof terrorism, wherever they may be. They constitute the\nclearest challenges to international peace and security\nin the twenty-first century. We also announce our\ncomplete support for and cooperation with the United\nStates Government as well as all the regional and\ninternational efforts aimed at tracking down the\nperpetrators of these brutal acts, bringing them to\njustice. We also stress our readiness to contribute to\nany international campaign aimed at eliminating\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. At the\nsame time, we call upon the international community to\nstrengthen the mechanisms and scope of relief aid for\nthe Afghan people, who have been afflicted by brutal\nwars for over two decades and who presently face the\nmost horrible and unprecedented internal displacement.\nThe changes that we are witnessing in the nature\nof international relations today, and the accompanying\naccelerated trends in the fields of globalization,\ntechnology, modern communications and economic\nopenness have not only had a positive impact on the\nlives and interests of certain States and peoples but\nhave rather contributed to widening the security,\neconomic, social, cultural and information gap and\ndifferences between the peoples of the developed and\nthe developing countries. At the same time, they have\nhelped to spawn new situations of conflict, civil and\nethnic wars and transnational problems. Accordingly,\nwe believe that the first steps to be taken to confront\nthe totality of these problems require, primarily,\nfinding a clear, comprehensive and balanced strategy of\nregional and international cooperation that takes into\nconsideration, as a matter of priority, the extent to\nwhich the concept of international security and peace,\non the one hand, and the problems of humanitarian\nneed and sustainable development, on the other, are\nlinked.\nIn this context, we stress the importance of the\nassumption by the United Nations, in cooperation and\ncoordination with other regional organizations, of a\nlarger role in international affairs. We believe in\ndialogue and peaceful negotiations as an ideal approach\nfor resolving disputes. We therefore look forward to a\nresponse from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the call\nby the United Arab Emirates to find a peaceful\nsettlement to the occupation of our three islands,\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa, either\nthrough direct negotiations or by referring the dispute\nto the International Court of Justice to be resolved on\nthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter\nand the principles of international law.\nWe also hope that the visit to Tehran of His\nExcellency Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan,\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, on 23 July 2001,\nand that of Mr. Mohamed Ali Abtahi, the Iranian\nPresident\u2019s envoy, to Abu Dhabi on 6 August 2001,\nwill contribute to the serious efforts being made to find\na peaceful solution to the issue of Iran\u2019s occupation of\nour three islands, promote confidence-building and\nenhance the principle of peaceful coexistence, mutual\ncooperation and good-neighbourliness.\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates would\nlike once again to welcome the acceptance by the two\nfraternal States of Qatar and Bahrain of the decision of\nthe International Court of Justice on the settlement of\ntheir previous disagreement over the disputed areas. It\nalso notes with satisfaction the arrangements made for\nthe demarcation of the boundaries between some\ncountries of the region and stresses that continuation of\nsuch an approach and peaceful trends in international\nrelations will strengthen the foundations of regional\nand international peace and security.\nThe question of Iraq has been taken up by the\nUnited Nations for 11 years and the Iraqi people are\nstill suffering from the continuation of the international\neconomic sanctions imposed on them. Although the\noil-for-food programme has helped alleviate the\nsuffering of certain sectors of Iraqi society, it clearly\ndoes not constitute the practical mechanism required to\ncontain and deal with the human tragedies and far-\nreaching destructive effects that these sanctions\ncontinue to inflict, not only on the infrastructure and\ninstitutions of the basic services sectors of the Iraqi\npeople, but also with regard to people\u2019s most\nelementary necessities, including nutritional, medical,\neducational and other care. We therefore call for a\n40\n\npolitical formula acceptable to all the parties concerned\nthat will ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi\npeople are lifted and, at the same time, the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of Iraq are maintained.\nThe re-establishment of normal ties between Iraq\nand Kuwait requires efforts to resolve the problems\nthat have arisen as a result of Iraq\u2019s occupation of\nKuwait in 1990, the most important of which is the\nreturn of Kuwaiti nationals and others held hostage or\nas prisoners of war, in accordance with international\nresolutions.\nWe welcome the Security Council resolution last\nSeptember to lift the international sanctions imposed\non our brother country Sudan. We also demand that the\nSecurity Council follow the same procedures in regard\nto the international sanctions imposed on our fraternal\ncountry Libya, especially now that its Government has\ncompletely fulfilled its commitments under the relevant\nCouncil resolutions.\nSince 28 September of last year, the occupied\nPalestinian territories have seen human tragedies and\nacts of violence because of the policy of State terrorism\npursued by Israel against the Palestinian people,\nincluding re-occupation of territories, expansion of\nsettlements, escalation of bombing and destruction of\neconomic and physical infrastructure in the Palestinian\nterritories, in addition to systematic liquidation and\nmassacres that have claimed the lives of more than\n1,300 martyrs and tens of thousands of other innocent\ncasualties, half of whom are children and women.\nThe United Arab Emirates warmly welcomes the\nannouncement made by President Bush three days ago\nin which he committed his country to helping establish\npeaceful coexistence between two States, Israel and\nPalestine. Once again, we fully support the right of\nPalestinians to self-determination and to establish their\nown independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. In\naddition, we strongly condemn all flagrant violations\nby Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people.\nWe call upon the United Nations \u2014 especially the\nSecurity Council and its permanent members \u2014 in\nparticular the United States, and European Union\nmembers to take all necessary and effective measures\nto avoid bias and double standards and to bring\npressure to bear on Israel to end immediately all its\nterrorist acts of aggression against Palestinians, their\ntowns and holy sites. In this connection, we call for the\nestablishment, without delay, of an international\nmechanism to provide the necessary protection for the\nPalestinian people.\nThe attainment of security and just and\ncomprehensive peace and stability in the Middle East\nrequires that Israel comply strictly with the agreements\nand protocols it has concluded within the framework of\nthe peace process and relevant resolutions of the\nUnited Nations. Those resolutions all call upon Israel\nto withdraw completely from all Palestinian and other\nArab territories it has occupied since 1967, including\nthe Holy City of Jerusalem, the Syrian Arab Golan and\nthe Shab\u2019a farms in Lebanon. They also call for the\nremoval of existing settlements and the return of\nPalestinian refugees to their homes.\nIsrael\u2019s possession of prohibited weapons,\nespecially nuclear weapons, is a direct threat to\nregional and international peace and security. We\ntherefore renew our call on the international\ncommunity to pressure the Israeli Government to\ndismantle its dangerous arsenal of weapons. We would\nalso like to emphasize that comprehensive international\ndisarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and\nimproving international mechanisms and arrangements\nfor non-proliferation have top priority in the area of\nregional and international security concerns. We also\ncall upon nuclear States and States that continue to\npursue the acquisition of such weapons to end such\ndangerous policies, which threaten regional and\ninternational peace and security.\nWe are following with deep concern the political\nand military events that have erupted in many regions,\nparticularly in South and South-East Asia, certain\nAfrican countries and the Balkans. We therefore stress\nthe need for the parties concerned to muster the\nnecessary political will and to try to resolve their\nproblems and disputes by resorting to dialogue and\npeaceful means, and on the basis of the principles of\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions.\nDespite the encouraging rates of economic\ngrowth and recovery achieved by some countries in the\nlast few years as a result of the information revolution,\nglobalization and the formidable technological\ndevelopments in the fields of communications and free\nmarkets, international reports and statistics have\nrecently indicated a slow-down in global economic\ngrowth due to the lack of a clear strategy for regional\nand international economic cooperation. That slow-\ndown has in turn aggravated the economic imbalance\n41\n\nbetween the countries of the North and those of the\nSouth. While the countries of the North enjoy\nprosperity, those of the South continue to suffer from\npoverty, unemployment, disease and environmental\npollution.\nTherefore the United Arab Emirates, which is\naccustomed to extending financial development\ninvestment and humanitarian assistance to many\ndeveloping countries and countries affected by natural\ndisasters and armed conflicts, calls upon developed\ncountries and international specialized agencies to\nincrease both their official and unofficial assistance to\ndeveloping countries. It is equally important that\nofficial development assistance to poor countries be\nincreased so as to alleviate the foreign debt burden, to\nhelp those countries secure access to world markets for\ntheir domestic products, to facilitate the transfer of\npeaceful technologies, and to assist them in containing\ntheir growing domestic problems so as to combat\npoverty, unemployment, environmental degradation\nand the spread of disease.\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on\nthe items on the agenda at this session will produce\npositive results that will enhance confidence-building\nmeasures and ensure security and stability in this world\nof numerous and quickly changing variables."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nGovernment and the people of Chad were profoundly\nshocked and saddened by the horrendous attacks on the\nUnited States of America that took place on 11\nSeptember 2001 in New York and Washington. I would\nlike to take this opportunity to convey once again the\nsincere condolences of the Government of Chad to the\nleaders of that friendly country and to the families of\nthe innocent victims.\nThose extremely barbaric attacks demonstrate\nhow urgently necessary it is for the international\ncommunity to move beyond the intentions expressed in\nthe various agreements on terrorism and agree on the\nimplementation of a genuine common plan of action to\neradicate terrorism totally and to free our world from\nthe suffering to which it is subjected as a result of\nextremism and fanaticism in all their forms. We must\nwork together to preserve peace and understanding\namong peoples for the sake of mankind\u2019s future and all\nthose who comprise it \u2014 Jews, Muslims, Christians\nand others.\nWhile vigorously stressing that nothing can\njustify terrorism, the Republic of Chad would\nnonetheless like to share with the Assembly some\nthoughts prompted by the serious situation facing the\nworld.\nTerrorist bases are found on every continent, and\nthe struggle against this scourge involves every\nreligious community. It is for this reason that we must\ndenounce the equation that is being made between\nterrorism and a given religion. It is unacceptable for\ncertain media to perpetuate that equation in world\nopinion, thereby inciting hatred and exclusion. The war\nagainst terrorism must therefore be global and\nmultidimensional in nature. It must be the subject of\ngenuine cooperation among all peace- and justice-\nloving States, and it must take place within the most\nappropriate international framework, namely, the\nUnited Nations.\nThis worldwide struggle need not necessarily be\nmilitary to be effective. It must go hand in hand with\neconomic measures to end the poverty and injustice\nevident in our world. We must also act on the political\nand diplomatic level to settle crisis situations and to\nidentify, try and punish those truly guilty of terrorist\nacts and their accomplices.\nNot long after the holding of the Millennium\nSummit and the Durban Conference against racism,\nand just before the high-level International Conference\non Financing for Development, scheduled for 2002, we\nmust unfortunately once again deplore the injustice,\npoverty and suffering endured by the overwhelming\nmajority of the world\u2019s peoples. In the course of our\nmany international meetings, we have constantly said\nthat the world needs more solidarity and that the\nwealthier countries must expand their financial efforts\nto contribute to the economic and social development\nof the neediest peoples. In saying that we are not\nasking for charity, but rather for realizing the legitimate\nright of those peoples to development. Alas, the real\nstate of affairs falls far short of our hopes.\n17\n\nPoverty continues to grow in the world, and the\nfuture of the world\u2019s poor is undermined by the plight\nof their children. Hundreds of millions of those\nchildren work in inhuman conditions in order to\nsurvive. They are left to their miserable fate in the\nstreets, subject to violence, drugs and prostitution,\nwhose corollary is AIDS. The situation is all the more\nappalling given that, despite promises to reduce or\ncancel the debt of poor countries, that debt continues to\ngrow, its burden hampering economic growth. At the\nsame time, some financial speculators can make tens of\nbillions of dollars in a single financial market\ntransaction \u2014 10, or even 20, times the amount of\nrecent years\u2019 generous debt write-offs.\nHow can our world continue to profess respect\nfor human rights while allowing those in the North and\nSouth who benefit from the global system that\ngenerates such poverty and all the injustices\nexacerbated by globalization? What meaning do human\nrights have for people who do not even have access to\nthe basic right to feed themselves? Can we therefore\ncontinue to dream of a better world knowing that the\nrich countries are continuing to cut back their\ndevelopment assistance?\nIt is therefore inconceivable to us to hope to fight\nterrorism without the genuine solidarity of the rich\ncountries with the neediest. Yes, in this troubled world\nin which the international community is threatened by\nmajor conflict, it would not be out of place to reaffirm\nour desire to see the emergence of genuine solidarity\namong peoples and nations in the form of sound and\nmutually advantageous cooperation in order to redress\nthese injustices, which are, I stress, the main breeding\ngrounds of terrorism.\nIn order to address all the challenges posed by\nthis difficult world, my country, Chad, knows that it\nmust rely above all on its own capacities if it is to\noccupy its rightful place in international life and to\nmake its modest contribution to the building of a better\nworld. That is the underlying message of the\nunrelenting struggle waged by President Idriss Deby\nsince 1 December 1990 to establish a pluralistic\ndemocracy in Chad, the guarantee of sustainable\ndevelopment in peace and stability.\nI wish to state today that my country recently\nreached a decisive stage in the consolidation of that\npluralistic democracy through the presidential election\nof 20 May. That election, the second of its kind in the\nhistory of Chad, involved seven competing candidates\nand resulted in the election of Mr. Idriss Deby, the\noutgoing President, to a second five-year term. It took\nplace in total transparency, as attested by national and\ninternational observers. Moreover, the Chadian\nGovernment attaches great importance to the\nlegislative elections to be held in 2002, with the\nassistance of the international community.\nOn the economic level, since 1995 Chad has\nfollowed a recovery strategy intended to lay the basis\nfor sustainable economic and social development.\nThorough reforms have been undertaken to improve\nand stabilize public finance, to correct external\nimbalances and to launch lasting growth. These actions\nrequire an effective anti-poverty policy, with respect to\nwhich Chad, through me, expresses its gratitude to the\ninternational community for its support, in particular at\nthe fourth Geneva round table of 1998 on the\ndevelopment of Chad and at the sectoral meeting and\nthe mid-term review meeting of 2000.\nFurthermore, following lengthy and heated\ndiscussion, the oil project has been finalized and is\noperating well. Chad is now vesting great hope in its\neffects and looks forward to using its resources to\nfinance its poverty reduction strategy. In that regard, I\nwould recall that, for the first time in the history of\npetroleum exploitation, legislation has been enacted to\nguarantee transparency in revenue management and to\nreserve a portion of the profit for local communities in\nthe producing region and their future generations.\nAlong with these domestic efforts, Chad will\ncontinue to work tirelessly for subregional and regional\nintegration in Africa. The challenges facing the modern\nworld require all nations to pool their means and\nefforts in great economic, monetary and cultural\ngroupings. Even if the international situation should\nbecome favourable and the industrialized countries\nshould choose to heed the voice of Africa, we believe\nthat it is up to Africans ourselves, first and foremost, to\nbuild our continent.\nThe launching in July 2001 in Lusaka of the\nprocess of establishing the organs of the African Union\nopened encouraging prospects for the achievement of\nthe legitimate aspirations of the African peoples to\npeace, security and well-being in a much fairer world.\nThe African peoples are convinced that only a genuine\nunion will allow Africa to address its challenges and to\n18\n\nextricate itself from the economic stagnation and\nviolence that plague it.\nCivil war and violence of all sorts, generated by\ninjustice and poverty, are found throughout the world\nand on every continent. Their proliferation and extent\nare deeply worrisome, especially since they are fuelled\nand perpetuated by certain countries that place their\nown interests above those of the peace and stability of\nnations. What can we say about the hesitation of\ncertain countries to participate actively or morally in\nprevention, management, settlement or peacekeeping\noperations? In our opinion, it is equally unthinkable to\nseek to combat terrorism while allowing crises that\nfeed it to persist.\nWith respect to such crises, allow me to refer to\ncertain conflicts situations that are of particular\nconcern to my country, Chad.\nCentral Africa, which in recent years has become\na theatre of political and tribal tensions, has ultimately\nbecome aware of its situation in the international\nlandscape. It has therefore resolutely committed itself\non the path to ensuring the creation of improved\nsecurity conditions. In that regard, we must commend\nthe efforts of the international mediators and those\nstatesmen who have personally and effectively\ncontributed to defusing a number of hotbeds of tension\nin that part of the continent.\nHowever, while we may welcome the restoration\nof peace in Congo Brazzaville, the same is not yet true\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where,\nregrettably, war continues to claim innocent victims.\nWe hope that the inter-Congolese dialogue begun in\nAddis Ababa will result in a peaceful settlement to that\nfratricidal conflict, which has gone on too long.\nWe also certainly welcome the stabilization of the\nsituation in the Central African Republic, but recent\nevents have revealed the precariousness of the\nsituation. In this regard, Chad reaffirms through me\nthat it will tolerate no destabilization of that fraternal\ncountry through its borders and will always do its\nutmost to promote understanding and concord among\nits Central African brothers. It also calls on the\ninternational community to assist that neighbouring\ncountry in the restoration of lasting peace.\nIn Burundi, although armed confrontations\ncontinue to occur, we welcome the establishment of a\nunion Government and hail the tireless work done by\nPresident Nelson Mandela as facilitator to ensure that\nthe current negotiation process leads to national peace\nand concord in the country.\nAs to Angola, the Government of the Republic of\nChad reaffirms its support for the legitimate\nGovernment in its efforts to achieve peace and security.\nIn West Africa, the agreement on voluntary\ndisarmament signed under the auspices of the United\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone has yielded tangible\nresults and is now the only proper course for resolving\nthe crisis in that country. We encourage the Economic\nCommunity of West African States to continue to work\nto restore lasting pace to that subregion.\nAs to the Horn of Africa, Chad encourages any\ninitiative on the part of the belligerent parties to bring\nabout national reconciliation in Somalia on the basis of\nthe Arta agreements. Likewise, the Chadian\nGovernment welcomes the observance of the ceasefire\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, and exhorts these two\nfraternal countries to build peace along their common\nborder. As to the embargo on Libya, Chad unreservedly\nsupports its immediate lifting, without conditions and\nin full, because it unjustly penalizes the fraternal\nLibyan people.\nIn the Middle East, it is time for the tragedy of\nthe Palestinian people, which has lasted for more than\nhalf a century, to be brought to a peaceful, fair and\nlasting conclusion. It is more urgent and necessary than\never for pressure of all kinds to be brought to bear on\nthe State of Israel to induce it to fulfil the terms of the\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\nPalestinian question, in particular resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973). The credibility of the\ninternational community depends on the ability of the\nPalestinians to enjoy all their rights, including the right\nto an independent and sovereign State.\nTurning to another injustice in the world, namely,\nthe inhuman embargo imposed on Iraq, my\nGovernment calls for its immediate and unconditional\nlifting, because it no longer has any justification. As to\nthe injustice committed by our Organization vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, the time has come to\nset things right, in order to allow that country, whose\nhuman, economic and political weight is unquestioned,\nto occupy its legitimate place in the family of nations,\nwhich is to say in the United Nations, following its\nrecent admission to the World Trade Organization,\nwhich we welcome.\n19\n\nOn this solemn occasion, we cannot fail to refer\nto another undemocratic and unjust feature of the\nstructures of our Organization. In this regard, I would\nlike to recall in the strongest terms that Chad still\nadheres to the common African position on the\nrestructuring of the United Nations, including the\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council, so as\nto ensure fair representation for all regions of the\nworld.\nBefore I conclude, allow me to extend to you, Sir,\nthe warm congratulations of the Chadian delegation on\nyour well-deserved election to lead the fifty-sixth\nregular session of the General Assembly. I am\nconvinced that your personal and professional qualities\nwill guarantee the successful conduct of our work.\nAllow me also to convey the sincere thanks of my\ndelegation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for\nthe tact and wisdom with which he conducted the work\nof the previous session.\nI wish lastly to convey the Republic of Chad\u2019s\nsincere congratulations to our brother Kofi Annan,\nSecretary-General of this Organization, on the renewed\ntrust that the international community has just placed\nin him for a second term, and also on the Nobel Peace\nPrize that was awarded to him and to the United\nNations. The dedication of the Secretary-General to the\ncause of peace, progress and development has been\nthoroughly demonstrated. We therefore wish to assure\nhim of the support and encouragement of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Chad throughout his\nnew term in office.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my honour to\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.\nSince the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the struggle\nagainst terrorism has become a clear priority on the\ninternational agenda. The United Nations is playing a\nkey role in coordinating joint measures to eliminate\ninternational terrorism. My country reaffirms its\ncommitment to be vigorous in handling this matter.\nWe must act on all levels \u2014 global, regional and\nnational \u2014 if we are to succeed in combating\nterrorism. Today, the need for international cooperation\nhas assumed new dimensions. To achieve sustainable\nresults in eliminating terrorism, joint international\naction is mandatory.\nLatvia strongly welcomes and supports Security\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\nLatvia is convinced that full and unconditional\nimplementation of Council resolution 1373 (2001) is\nimperative for success in the suppression of terrorism.\nThe financing of terrorism has to be prevented and\neliminated. All action or inaction by States or\nindividuals that allows the practice of terrorism has to\nbe stopped. Cooperation and information exchange\namong States concerning terrorist activities has to be\nstrengthened. Latvia welcomes the establishment of the\nSecurity Council Committee to monitor the\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001).\nLatvia supports efforts undertaken by other\ninternational organizations acting on the regional level.\nAs an aspiring member of the Euro-Atlantic\ncommunity, Latvia plays its part in the common\nactivities carried out by the European Union and the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. In order to\nharmonize regional measures to prevent acts of\nterrorism, an action plan for Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries was adopted at the recent Warsaw\nconference on combating terrorism. Another important\nEuropean framework for combating terrorism is the\nCouncil of Europe, which has already formulated a\nwide range of legal instruments intended to fight\nterrorism.\nMy country fully shares the position of the\nEuropean Union that we must redouble our efforts to\nfight international terrorism. That includes both our\ncommitment as members of the international\ncommunity and the \u201chomework\u201d we have to do as\nindividual States.\nA high-level task force has been established in\nLatvia to coordinate national efforts against terrorism,\nincluding implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). Latvia has\ninitiated the national legislative process of ratifying the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\n2\n\nFinancing of Terrorism, and it is foreseen that we will\nsign the Convention by the end of this year.\nThe Latvian Government has approved an action\nplan for combating terrorism. This is a set of measures\naimed at strengthening my country\u2019s ability to prevent\nits territory, banking system and other assets from\nbeing used by terrorists. There should be no place\nwhere terrorists can hide from justice. Latvia has\nalready formulated legislation in the area of preventing\nmoney laundering. Banks and other operators are\nobliged to report on suspicious transfers. The\nGovernment has submitted to the parliament a package\nof further amendments to the banking law and the law\non the prevention of the laundering of proceeds derived\nfrom criminal activity.\nAs it defends the world from terrorism, the\ninternational community has to do its utmost to spare\nthe innocent people of Afghanistan further suffering.\nLatvia fully supports the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and other\nparties in their efforts to bring about a fully inclusive\npolitical system in Afghanistan. My country welcomes\nSecurity Council resolution 1378 (2001). The Latvian\nGovernment has also taken the decision to provide\nhumanitarian aid to the Afghan people through the\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees.\nWe believe that the priorities that existed before\n11 September are all the more valid today. A year ago,\nheads of State or Government adopted the Millennium\nDeclaration, which renewed the spirit of the United\nNations and which clearly demonstrated that the world\nand its peoples need this Organization. Latvia attaches\ngreat importance to the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration, especially in relation to issues\nof human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rights of\nthe child and conflict prevention. We consider that the\nfollow-up process to the Millennium Summit should be\nan integral part of the work of the United Nations.\nInternational relations in the twenty-first century have\nto be based on values and principles set out in the\nDeclaration.\nThe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly\ndemonstrated that the commitment that was put into the\nMillennium Declaration was genuine. The results of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s special sessions on human\nsettlements and on HIV/AIDS, the United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the Durban\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nhave set a number of goals at the State, regional and\nglobal levels. The process has started, and Latvia is\nactively participating in pursuit of the common goals.\nThe United Nations is the only global\nOrganization charged with the fundamental task of\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war\nand with the maintenance of lasting peace and\ninternational security. One of its most important tasks,\ntherefore, involves peacekeeping operations.\nMy country has actively participated in United\nNations-mandated peacekeeping operations since 1996.\nThis year Latvia is continuing to provide support to\nstabilize the situation in the Balkans and is\nparticipating, with troops and personnel, in all United\nNations-mandated, NATO-led operations in the\nBalkans, as well as in other operations and endeavours\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE).\nLatvia, which attaches great importance to\npeacekeeping operations, voluntarily increased its\ncontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping\nbudget starting in 2001.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt has been one of the priorities of the United\nNations for a decade. My country signed the Rome\nStatute in 1999, and the Government will present to\nParliament the ratification bill of the Statute and drafts\nof the necessary amendments to our national legislation\nas soon as possible. Latvia also hopes to be among the\nfirst 60 States to ratify the Statute.\nThis is an important session of the General\nAssembly for Latvia and for its people. This year\nmarks a decade since Latvia joined the United Nations\nas a free and independent country. The United Nations\nwas the first international organization that Latvia\njoined, after 50 years of occupation. The United\nNations has a special meaning for Latvia. Latvia\u2019s\njoining the United Nations demonstrates the\ncommitment of my country to rejoin the international\ncommunity and to take an active part in international\nevents and processes.\nIn these 10 years, Latvia has made great headway\nin its development, and this growth encompasses a\nvariety of realms. Latvia\u2019s foreign policy is rooted in\n3\n\nthe observance of international law, the development of\nhuman rights and democracy and the protection of\nuniversally accepted human values. The top priorities\nof Latvian foreign policy continue to be joining the\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization. These are not goals in themselves, but,\nrather, means to ensure sustainable development. Our\nforeign policy priorities also include good-neighbourly\nrelations, bilateral cooperation and active participation\nin international organizations.\nI have the honour to announce that Latvia is\nchanging its status from that of aid recipient to that of\ndonor country, in order to provide its support to others\nthrough both financial assistance and the sharing of\nexperiences. Latvia has begun to elaborate its concept\nof a donor country. We are looking forward to the\nimplementation of this concept and are assisting those\nwho are in urgent need of our help.\nIn conclusion, I would like to congratulate the\nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\non having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in\nrecognition of the work that has been carried out. I am\nconvinced that we, as Member States, will continue to\nspare no effort in safeguarding the principles and ideals\nfor which the United Nations stands.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe people and Government of Papua New Guinea, I\nwish to join previous speakers in congratulating the\nPresident on his election to this prestigious post.\nHis election shows the high esteem in which the\ninternational community holds both him personally and\nhis country, the Republic of Korea.\nMy delegation is confident that, through his great\ndiplomatic skills and leadership, which is already\nevident, he will continue to guide the work of this\nsession of the General Assembly to its successful\nconclusion.\nI also take this opportunity, through him, to\nexpress my delegation\u2019s sincere appreciation to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his\noutstanding leadership and stewardship in facilitating\nthe work of the historic Millennium Summit and the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nWe also congratulate and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan for his re-election to the office of Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations and for the award of the\nNobel Peace Prize.\nPapua New Guinea is resolute in its commitment\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations\nCharter. Papua New Guinea acknowledges the value of\nmany of the United Nations treaties and declarations,\nincluding those that advance human rights, the rule of\nlaw and good governance. Many of these principles are\nenumerated in our national Constitution.\nWe acknowledge that the Organization has had\nsome limitations, many of which are self-inflicted. We\nnote that the United Nations is now in a much healthier\n31\n\nfinancial position than ever before. However, there is\nno room for complacency in the pursuit of its reform\nprogramme. The United Nations bodies and systems\nmust be restructured to reflect new dynamics and\ngeopolitical changes and to create hope for all at the\nbeginning of the new millennium.\nWe believe that our common global and regional\nproblems cannot be resolved under the auspices of\nviolence, terrorism, war and destruction; nor can they\nbe resolved in a vacuum. The United Nations provides\na forum and an avenue for fostering dialogue for\npeaceful resolution of disputes.\nAn effective Security Council, we believe, should\nbe representative of all subregions of the world. My\nGovernment also believes that the use of the veto\npower should be limited to Chapter VII issues, while\nthe working methods and deliberations of the Council\nshould be more transparent and democratic.\nPapua New Guinea\u2019s development aspirations\nhave been compromised by problems associated with\nthe downturn in the global economy, the economic\ncrisis within the Asia-Pacific region and natural\ndisasters, over all of which we have little control. The\nGovernment has addressed these challenges through a\ncomprehensive programme of structural adjustments.\nWe have worked hard to make sure that these structural\nadjustments are made in the public sector in order to\nstimulate and expand growth in the private sector.\nThe measures we have adopted have stabilized\nthe economy. However, as we look into the future, we\ncannot but hope that the incidents of 11 September will\nnot unduly affect our future recovery. Judging by the\nevidence of a downturn in the United States economy,\nit seems clear that every effort is required to make the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment next year a success.\nWe are grateful to the Friends of Papua New\nGuinea group, comprising Australia, Japan, the\nEuropean Commission and China, among others, which\nhave been generous in assisting our Government in its\ndevelopment efforts. The World Bank, International\nMonetary Fund and Asian Development Bank have\nalso been very positive in their responses to our\npolicies.\nMy country has experienced an unfortunate and\nterrible conflict and has been trying to build mutual\nconfidence and security by pursuing a progressive\npolitical settlement, including through restoration and\ndevelopment for the past four years in its Bougainville\nProvince. We have utilized the Melanesian way of\nbuilding consensus between all parties to the conflict.\nThe consensus is now reflected in the Bougainville\nPeace Agreement, signed by the parties on 30 August\nthis year. The Government is resolute in its desire to\nimplement the Agreement. It has completed work on\ndrafting amendments to our Constitution to provide for\ngreater autonomy, a referendum and amnesty. Together\nwith ongoing efforts to implement other aspects of the\nAgreement, the parties are expected to facilitate\nprogress on weapons disposal and associated issues,\nsuch as reconciliation and the unification of political\nand administrative structures in Bougainville. A special\nsession of Parliament will be been convened next\nweek, on 22 November, to continue to debate the\nAgreement. Parliament will deliberate on the\nconstitutional amendments on or soon after 14\nDecember this year.\nWe wish to place on record our deep appreciation\nto the United Nations, in particular Ambassador Noel\nSinclair and his team on Bougainville, the United\nNations Development Programme, the European\nUnion, individual European Union members and the\nGovernments of Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand,\nSolomon Islands and Vanuatu for their continuing and\nconstructive roles in Bougainville.\nIt is also my pleasure to speak on behalf of the\nBougainville parties and the Government to thank the\nSecretary-General and all members of the Security\nCouncil, past and present, for continuing to renew the\nmandate of the United Nations Political Office in\nBougainville. We are confident that the Security\nCouncil will continue to provide all the assistance we\nneed with respect to arms collection, storage and\ndisposal.\nThe process of decolonization will not be\ncompleted until the people of the remaining 17 Non-\nSelf-Governing Territories have exercised their right to\nself-determination and/or achieved self-government.\nPapua New Guinea welcomes the cooperation of\nthe Government of France with regard to the progress\nmade in implementing the Noum\u00e9a Accords and setting\nin motion the eventual exercise of the right of self-\ndetermination by the people of New Caledonia,\nespecially the indigenous Kanak people.\n32\n\nWe acknowledge the full cooperation of the\nGovernment of New Zealand in the progress made so\nfar with respect to the question of the Tokelau Islands.\nMy Government notes the progress made in East\nTimor. We heartily welcome the announcement of 20\nMay 2002 as the day the people of East Timor will\nattain independence and nationhood. We look forward\nto welcoming them as a full Member of this family of\nnations.\nPapua New Guinea continues to urge the other\nadministering Powers to cooperate with the Special\nPolitical and Decolonization Committee in\nimplementing and completing its mandate soon.\nThe future of each of the remaining Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories can be assured only by a\npositive, constructive and, above all, transparent\napproach to developing a unique solution for each of\nthem.\nThe fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly\nestablished the Consultative Process on oceans to\nimprove the coordination and management of the\nprogrammes associated with the use, development and\nprotection of the oceans and seas. The Consultative\nProcess has been successful in bringing to the fore, and\nfocusing the attention of Member States on, a number\nof issues.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum group includes small\nisland developing States that are custodians of the\nlargest ocean space. This ocean space is rich in natural\nand marine resources. However, the small island\ndeveloping States of the region have limited human,\nfinancial and technological capacities to harvest,\ncontrol, manage and secure these resources for the\nbenefit of our current and future generations.\nIt has been said that to divert the poor from the\ncall of the evil, it is not enough to appeal to their\nstomachs only. Rather, one must appeal to their\naspirations as well. We joined others having particular\ninterest in the sustainable use and management of the\nfish stocks in our region to establish the Convention on\nthe Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean\nin September 2000. The next meeting of the signatories\nto this Convention will be held in Papua New Guinea\nearly next year.\nWe welcome Malta\u2019s lodgement last Sunday of its\ninstrument of ratification of the Agreement for the\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish\nStocks. The Agreement, which will now come into\nforce on 11 December 2001, called on States to\ncooperate to enhance the ability of developing States,\nin particular the least developed and small island\ndeveloping States, to conserve and develop their own\nfisheries for such stocks. For all small island\ndeveloping States in the Pacific, financing for\ndevelopment has to be linked to the development of\ntheir fisheries sector.\nIn order to emphasize my point, I have provided\nsome data on the last page of my written statement.\nThe Assembly will note that the Central and Western\nPacific fishery is valued in excess of $2.5 billion per\nannum, while the Pacific small island developing\nStates earn an average of only $66 million per annum\nin licensing fees. For the small island developing States\nof the Pacific to attain sustainable growth and\ndevelopment, this situation has to change.\nLast year my delegation also welcomed the\nconclusion by the International Seabed Authority of the\nexploration code for seabed mining. Continuing work\nis to be undertaken with respect to a code for\nexploration for polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich\ncrusts. Papua New Guinea has particular interest in\npolymetallic sulfides.\nMy delegation would like to thank once again the\nSecretary-General of the International Seabed\nAuthority, Ambassador Satya Nandan, for his report on\nthe work of the Authority. We welcome the execution\nof contracts by pioneer investors and urge the\nremaining pioneer investor to follow suit as soon as\npossible.\nPapua New Guinea supports the principles\ncontained in the Barbados Programme of Action and in\nAgenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development. We continue to support\nthe principles contained in the Kyoto Protocol and the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange. We once again stress the urgent need for\ndeveloped countries to make a concerted effort to\nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\nMy delegation welcomes the achievements of part\ntwo of the sixth session of the Conference of the\nParties to the climate change Convention, held at Bonn\n33\n\nlast July, and the successful completion of the recent\nseventh session of the Conference, held at Marrakesh,\nMorocco.\nAnother of the greatest challenges facing the\nUnited Nations is to strengthen the capacity of the\nglobal community to respond promptly and effectively\nto climate change and natural disaster. In 1997, Papua\nNew Guinea experienced drought and frost caused by\nEl Ni\u00f1o and in 1998 came the tsunami and the La Ni\u00f1a\nphenomenon, bringing floods and landslides and\nleaving death and destruction in their wake. We\nacknowledge the prompt and generous support of our\nneighbours in dealing with the effects of such disasters.\nGlobal warming has also brought increased numbers of\ncases of diseases such as malaria to the higher-altitude\nand most populous region of our country. The threat of\nincreased incidence of malaria in that region is real,\nand could negatively affect the demographics of the\ncountry. There is definitely a link among climate\nchange, natural disaster and the spread and increased\nincidence of disease.\nNor is Papua New Guinea exempt from the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic or from tuberculosis. We are grateful to\nAustralia and to other partners which have provided\nassistance in that field of health care. We also welcome\nagain last year\u2019s announcement by the Japanese\nGovernment that it would set aside substantial financial\nresources for disease eradication programmes in\ndeveloping countries.\nThe forthcoming International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit for\nSustainable Development must be platforms for\nlaunching new and innovative methods for realigning\nthe policies of the Bretton Woods institutions so that\nthey focus more on development and on the eradication\nof poverty. There must be a concerted effort to link\nnew and innovative financial instruments to the\ndelivery of specific outcome-oriented approaches.\nThere must be flexibility in assisting developing\ncountries, especially small island, landlocked and least\ndeveloped countries. As I have said before, for the\npeoples of the Pacific islands to become meaningful\nparticipants in the globalization process, new financial\ninstruments and mechanisms should be developed to\nfacilitate the transfer of technological capacity and\nexpertise in the fisheries sector.\nPapua New Guinea is committed to peaceful\ndialogue among nations and condemns those that\nemploy terrorism against people or that finance, recruit\nor train terrorists or mercenaries. The barbaric acts of\n11 September have been described in many ways.\nSome have called them horrendous, despicable and the\nwork of evil-doers. The use of any adjective to describe\nthe horror and the continuing threat to human security\nonly adds to the esteem in which some hold the\nperpetrators. The use of qualifiers to describe the\ninnocence of the deceased lends legitimacy to those\nacts and shields the nakedness of their wilful and\nwrongful nature.\nPapua New Guinea condemns the 11 September\nattacks on the United States and supports the ongoing\ncampaign by the United States and its allies against\nterrorism. On behalf of the Government and the people\nof Papua New Guinea, I convey our heartfelt\ncondolences to the immediate families and other\nrelatives of all those who had their lives brutally taken\naway from them in New York, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania. My Government is committed to\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nand is in the process of examining all existing\nconventions relating to terrorism with a view to\nacceding to them early next year.\nPapua New Guinea also notes the death several\ndays ago of the political leader of the people of the\nIndonesian province of Irian Jaya, Mr. Theys Eluay,\nunder questionable circumstances. As a neighbouring\ncountry which shares a common border with that\nprovince, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the\nlikely spillover effect of new developments in the\nprovince. We urge Indonesia to undertake a thorough,\nimpartial and transparent investigation into Mr. Eluay\u2019s\ndeath, to make public the results and to bring to justice\nthose responsible.\nMy Government is committed to a stable,\npeaceful and environmentally safe world and therefore\nsupports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of the\nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. We call on all\nthat have nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass\ndestruction, including biological weapons, to stop\ntesting, manufacturing and storing them, and\nfurthermore to take steps to destroy them.\nWe also support efforts to ban transboundary\nmovements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes\nthrough the Pacific region. We call on those States that\npreviously conducted nuclear-weapon tests or that have\n34\n\ndischarged chemical or other non-degradable wastes in\nour subregion to adequately compensate and provide\nappropriate medical assistance to the scores of persons\nand families affected. Remedial action should be taken\nto clean up the damage done to the environment.\nGlobal and regional partnerships to promote\nchange are the key to addressing the challenges that the\nworld will face in the twenty-first century. Papua New\nGuinea believes that a challenge for Member States is\nto reshape the Organization so that it can serve as an\neffective tool for implementing our collective desire: to\nmake the global village a better place for all.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffBefore I\nproceed, allow me, on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of Nicaragua, to express our sorrow to the\npeople and the Government of the Dominican Republic\nfor yesterday\u2019s event. Allow me also, Mr. President, to\njoin those who have come before me in congratulating\nyou on your well-deserved election as President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and to\nexpress my confidence that under your competent\ndirection this session will conclude its work\nsuccessfully. I also wish to express our most profound\nappreciation for the praiseworthy work achieved by the\noutgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland.\nLikewise, I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, not only for having been re-\nelected to a second mandate with the consensus of the\nentire international community, but also for the recent,\nwell-deserved, high distinction of being awarded,\ntogether with the United Nations, the Nobel Peace\nPrize.\nThe people and the Government of Nicaragua\nreceived with great concern the news of the criminal\nterrorist attacks against the people and the Government\nof the United States on 11 September. Since then, we\nhave offered our solidarity and cooperation to the\npeople and the Government of the United States for the\ncapture and punishment of all those involved in those\nabhorrent acts. The magnitude of those terrorist acts\nbrings new and diverse challenges in the political,\neconomic and security areas. The enemies of peace and\ndemocracy have attempted to create a widespread\n5\n\nclimate of uncertainty and fear. For this reason, our\nfirst challenge is not to allow ourselves to be\nintimidated or paralysed by their criminal threats and\nactions.\nAt the Central American level, on 19 September\nin Honduras, the Presidents of the isthmus adopted a\nDeclaration entitled \u201cCentral America united against\nterrorism\u201d, in which we strongly condemned any ties\nbetween groups or sectors in the Central American\nregion and international terrorism. As of that date, we\nbegan to undertake concrete initiatives aimed at\nimproving information systems between neighbouring\ncountries; increasing coordination between air and\nnaval forces to deal with illicit traffic; ensuring better\nborder monitoring; enabling the exchange of\ninformation between specialized public security\nagencies; increasing control over travel documents; and\nstrengthening security for airports and civil aviation.\nNicaragua is a party to those measures and\nprovisions that promote and safeguard international\nand regional peace and security through the prevention\nand peaceful resolution of disputes between States and\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear and conventional\nweapons of mass destruction, which contravene the\nprinciples of international humanitarian law.\nOur firm commitment to world peace and security\nled my country to host the Third Meeting of the States\nParties to the Ottawa Convention, despite the fact that\nthat meeting took place soon after the events of 11\nSeptember. The Managua Conference allowed the\nStates parties to renew their commitment and to note\nwith satisfaction the important progress that has been\nmade in the crusade to eliminate anti-personnel\nlandmines. The ratification of the Convention by more\nthan 120 States; the strengthening of the mechanisms\nfor its implementation; the progress in mine removal;\nthe destruction of mines stockpiled in different parts of\nthe world; and the virtual embargo on the international\ntrade in these weapons are concrete steps in our effort\nto end the suffering brought about by antipersonnel\nmines.\nI would like to earnestly appeal to the States that\nhave not yet done so to ratify the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as the Convention for\nthe Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines. Nicaragua\nalso welcomes with satisfaction the Programme of\nAction to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade\nin small arms and light weapons in all its aspects,\nadopted on 21 July.\nJust one year ago, we convened the Millennium\nSummit, at which we made commitments designed to\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century and\nreaffirmed our faith in the United Nations as the central\ninstrument for promoting peace, security, prosperity\nand justice.\nIn order to respond effectively to the challenges\nthat the new millennium imposes on us \u2014 challenges\nthat cannot be ignored \u2014 it is crucial that we take\nresolute steps to reform the United Nations, ensuring\nthat its policies and structures are commensurate with\nthe realities and aspirations of contemporary\ninternational society. Nicaragua shares the interest of\nall Member States in strengthening our Organization so\nas to optimize its work in the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, conflict prevention,\nthe promotion of sustainable development and the\nbattle against poverty.\nIn this context, it is crucial to move forward with\nreform of the Security Council so that that body can\nrespond fully and effectively to current needs and to\nfuture challenges to our peoples.\nFurthermore, the profound changes experienced\nby societies throughout the world since 1945 require\nthe United Nations urgently to reaffirm its universal\nvocation as a fundamental prerequisite for confronting\nnew challenges through the full and effective\nparticipation of all peoples, without distinction and\nexcluding no one.\nHowever, this universal vocation cannot be fully\nrealized as long as a democratic State and signatory of\nthe San Francisco Charter is unable to participate as a\nfull-fledged Member within the United Nations system.\nAs is well known, the Republic of China is a\ndemocratic country, and its freely and transparently\nelected Government is the only one that can\nlegitimately represent the interests and desires of the\npeople of Taiwan at the United Nations. We should not\ncontinue to deny the 23 million people who live in the\nRepublic of China the right to be represented in the\nUnited Nations and to share with us the efforts to\npromote peace and development for future generations.\nLet us recall that the Republic of China has\nplayed a positive role in the promotion of world trade,\nthe eradication of poverty and the advancement of\n6\n\nhuman rights. These laudable efforts at the national and\ninternational levels must be recognized by the United\nNations; the Republic of China should be given the\nright to integrate itself into the international order of\nthe United Nations, having fulfilled the basic\nconditions in accordance with international law.\nSince the beginning of my mandate in 1997, we\nNicaraguans have taken significant steps in the\nimportant task of consolidating democracy and guiding\nour country along the path of development. The\nNicaraguan people have made great sacrifices in laying\nthe foundations of sustainable human development by\nstrengthening the rule of law; stabilizing the economy\nthrough the implementation of responsible financial\nand fiscal policies; providing for the effective\nparticipation of civil society in national decision-\nmaking; and formulating a long-term strategy in the\nbattle against poverty and for reducing economic,\nsocial and environmental vulnerability. That process,\nhowever, has not been easy, because of the heavy\nburden of our external national debt, international\nfinancial crises, the fall in the price of our main export\nproducts and natural disasters.\nThe elections held in my country on 4 November\nwill go down in national history as an example of\ntransparency, public spirit and profound democratic\nconviction. The orderly and transparent way in which\nthe process unfolded, broad citizen participation, with\nfewer than 10 per cent of the population failing to take\npart, and the attitude of the people of Nicaragua reflect\nof the degree to which my country has progressed in\nstrengthening its democratic institutions.\nWe strongly support the convening of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development to take place in\nJohannesburg, South Africa, in September 2002, the\ntask of which will be to determine the current status of\nthe implementation of the commitments undertaken at\nthe Earth Summit. As a reflection of that will, we note\nour ratification of the Conventions on Climate Change\nand Biological Diversity, the efforts carried out by the\nNational Council for Sustainable Development and\nNicaragua\u2019s participation in major projects for the\npreservation of the rich ecosystems of the region, such\nas the Meso-American Biological Corridor and the\nAtlantic Biological Corridor.\nThe new problems and challenges that humanity\nfaces greatly exceed our individual capabilities as\nStates. For that reason, it is imperative that we renew\nour commitment to the goals and principles of the\nUnited Nations, which will allow us to continue to\nadvance in the building of a world that is more just,\npeaceful and secure for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to\njoin other speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir,\non your election as President of the fifty-sixth session\nof the General Assembly. It is my deep conviction that\nin this difficult situation we will, under your\nexperienced leadership, materialize the expectations of\nthe international community, which has always desired\nto view the United Nations as a reliable guarantor of\nworld peace. I recall our recent meeting in Seoul, and it\nis a pleasure for me to see you, Sir, presiding over the\nGeneral Assembly this year. I also wish to thank your\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his hard work,\ndedication and leadership in presiding over the fifty-\nfifth session of the General Assembly.\n7\n\nThe recent brutal terrorist attack against our host\ncountry, which has left all of us in deep shock, was\nundoubtedly also directed against the United Nations\nand its principles and values, which we as Member\nStates share. This inhuman act was an attack on all of\nus. However, it has united the international community,\nwhich realized the potential danger and threat of\nterrorism to the existence of human civilization. The\ninternational community has responded in the only way\nappropriate: international terrorism cannot be tolerated;\nall the nations of the world must stand united in the\nbattle against this evil; and they have to search\nvigorously for ways to effectively respond to it.\nWe were relieved to see the United Nations acting\npromptly and in a very determined way, adopting the\nvery next day General Assembly and Security Council\nresolutions urging the international community to\nredouble its efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist\nacts by increased cooperation and full implementation\nof the relevant international anti-terrorist conventions\nand Security Council resolutions. In particular,\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) is of a great\nimportance and must be fully implemented.\nWe appreciate that after the terrorist attacks,\ncountries and international organizations have\nmanifested moral maturity and their capacity to closely\ncooperate and coordinate their actions in the fight\nagainst world terrorism. We welcome the active and\nirreplaceable role the United Nations plays in this fight.\nAs United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nexplicitly stated in his response to the arrogant and\ndisdainful words of bin Laden addressed to the United\nNations, people will understand that the position of the\nUnited Nations is the expression of the will of all its\nMembers.\nA year ago, many of my colleagues and I\nelaborated on the role of the United Nations in\ncombating international terrorism. The Slovak\nRepublic joined the anti-terrorist coalition swiftly,\neffectively and without any hesitation. It will remain a\nfirm part of the coalition of nations and people\nresolved to fight terrorism and determined to face this\nthreat to peace and security on our planet. The Slovak\nRepublic is a party to 11 of the 12 universal anti-\nterrorist conventions. Shortly, we hope to ratify the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which we signed last January.\nWe call on all other countries to redouble their efforts\nin order to achieve a speedy conclusion of a\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism.\nThe terrorist attack has certainly changed our\nperception of the world. A re-assessment of\ninternational arrangements is a necessity in this\ncontext. After a period of mostly emotional reactions,\nwe now need more qualified answers, supported by\nresolve and responsibility. I am convinced that the\nresolve and responsibility will be translated into\nexecutive actions and systemic steps by the United\nNations.\nThe legal instruments devised here at the United\nNations constitute an especially good basis for\ndeepening the effectiveness of the fight against\nterrorism. Using the words of the aphorist Blaise\nPascal, I want to emphasize that the only thing that\nremains to be done is to implement all the good\nprinciples that have already been laid down. It is\nencouraging that the words of comfort and the ideas\nand commitments uttered by high representatives of the\nMember States of this, the most universal international\ncommunity, overwhelmingly share that spirit. Slovakia\nfully associates itself with those views. In that context,\nwe wish to express our hope that the Rome Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court will enter into force\nsometime next year. With that the international\ncommunity will be establishing a body that will end\nimpunity for crimes of the greatest seriousness,\nincluding crimes against humanity.\nThe world has a unique opportunity to achieve\nprogress in tackling long-lasting conflicts through joint\nefforts. Slovakia considers United Nations\npeacekeeping operations to be one of the key and most\nvisible aspects of the Organization\u2019s activities. We\nview all United Nations activities in conflict\nprevention, peacekeeping, peace support and peace-\nbuilding as particularly important. It is the people in\nthe regions suffering from conflict who look to our\nOrganization with hope, and we must not let them\ndown.\nAs a country that is materially and personally\ninvolved, we welcome with great attention and\ndevotion and participate actively in the discussions\naimed at reforming and improving the efficiency of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. We are ready to continue\ncontributing our share in every possible way to this\nnoble endeavour. The participation of the Slovak\nRepublic in United Nations peacekeeping operations\n8\n\nhas grown almost six-fold since the beginning of the\nyear 2000. This year we took part in the United Nations\nmission in East Timor, where we deployed a level II\nhospital. In Cyprus the Slovak contingent has replaced\nAustria and has become the lead nation in Sector 4. We\nhave sent our demining experts and other personnel to\nthe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nI would also like to add my personal note to this\ndescription of my country\u2019s engagement. For the past\ntwo years, the Secretary-General has entrusted me with\nan exceptionally demanding and responsible task,\nnamely, to serve as his Special Envoy for the Balkans\nand to oversee the peaceful resolution of the still-\nsmouldering conflict in Kosovo. I am aware of the\ncritical importance of the coming elections to be held\nin Kosovo under the supervision of the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). I\nam now therefore in a position to state a single critical\nthesis: that area must stay multi-ethnic and the\ninternational community must continue to be consistent\nin its policies on the matter.\nAs a country that is experiencing dynamic\ndevelopment and one that shares a great interest in\nstable international development and the prosperity of\nthe international community, Slovakia also has an\nambition to play a more visible role in the United\nNations. Our Prime Minister, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda, also\nclearly expressed our position on many other topics\nand challenges at last year\u2019s Millennium Summit. The\nspirit of the commendable initiatives adopted at the\nSummit will produce the best results only through their\nunrestricted practical implementation, although new\nand unprecedented barriers have emerged on the way.\nOur position on the issue of Security Council\nreform is linked to the importance of making the\nOrganization more effective. Let us be honest and\nadmit that we have not been fully successful in\nachieving this goal for years, and that we will now\nhave to cope with new and unprecedented challenges.\nIn my letter to the previous President of the General\nAssembly I emphasized that, in addition to maintaining\nsufficient representativeness, the Security Council\nshould also preserve sufficient operational flexibility.\nWe also believe that the Security Council should base\nits decision-making on majority voting, and that the\nright of veto should only be reserved for decisions\ntaken under Chapter VII of the Charter.\nSlovakia supports the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil in both the non-permanent and the permanent\ncategories of membership. However, the failure to\nachieve consensus on the enlargement of one category\nshould not result in blocking enlargement in another\ncategory. I avail myself of this opportunity to confirm\nthat while increasing the number of Security Council\nmembers in the category of elected non-permanent\nmembers, we consider it fully justified to allocate one\nadditional seat to the Group of Eastern European\nStates. Its membership has doubled in the last decade.\nExceptionally urgent current challenges have cast\na malicious shadow of destruction over this year\u2019s\nagenda of the General Assembly, which I have not\ncommented on in detail. I would like, however, to\nassure the Assembly that Slovakia believes in the need\nfor a universal world organization \u2014 which the United\nNations is \u2014 as a source of hope for a better and more\njust world. We have no doubts about the irreplaceable\nrole of the United Nations in tackling global issues, be\nit the protection of human rights, the eradication of\nfamine, poverty, diseases and illiteracy or the\nprevention of drug and arms proliferation or\nguaranteeing sustainable development. A life of dignity\nfor all of us is really unthinkable without the enduring\ninvolvement of the United Nations. However, it\nrequires universal respect of its paramount place in\ninternational life, and joint cooperation in intensifying\nits activities.\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline the\nfeeling of deep satisfaction of my country, and me\npersonally, with the appointment of Mr. Kofi Annan to\nserve a second term as the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral. I also wish to voice our recognition of the\nhonour given to him personally and to our universal\nworld Organization through the prestigious and well-\ndeserved award of the centenary Nobel Peace Prize,\nand to congratulate him wholeheartedly on this\nachievement\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFiji mourns the recent losses\nand world-changing tragedies which the United States\nof America has endured. We remember the many lives\nlost in that adversity, and we express the hope that\npeace and goodwill may prevail. Now is the time to\nmake haste to galvanize collaborative efforts by\ndeveloped and developing nations in the global fight\nagainst terrorism.\nWe congratulate His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo and the Government of the Republic of Korea on\nAmbassador Han\u2019s assumption of the presidency of the\n25\n\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We pledge\ncomplete support during his term of office, fully aware\nthat the qualities that have marked his eminent and\ndistinguished career promise a resounding conclusion\nto the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\ndespite its difficult start.\nFitting tribute is also due to his predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. His leadership over the\nprevious year successfully concluded a truly hectic and\nfull schedule of business, including some difficult\nissues and special sessions during the period of the\nfifty-fifth session. He leaves an indelible mark in the\nannals of the United Nations.\nMy Government congratulates His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan on his appointment as Secretary-\nGeneral for a second term; this signifies the trust and\nconfidence that the United Nations places in him. He\nhas aptly been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which\nhe shares with the United Nations. Fiji welcomes the\nroad map he has outlined for the Organization, which,\nunder his creative and competent leadership, will\ndeliver the reforms needed to launch the Organization\ninto the twenty-first century.\nIn the wake of the political crisis that triggered\ninstability in Fiji in 2000, my Government set itself\ntwo immediate tasks: to restore constitutional\ndemocracy and to stabilize our fragile economy. Those\ngoals are being achieved. Moreover, my Government is\ncontinuing to pursue strong economic performance\nthrough increased investment and development.\nI am honoured to inform the Assembly that, only\n18 months after its political crisis, Fiji successfully\nconcluded the general elections and formed a\nmultiparty Government in September 2001. My\nGovernment is confident that, with the support of the\nUnited Nations and the international community, Fiji\u2019s\nforward-looking policies will steer it ahead on a path of\ndemocratic rule and sustainable economic\ndevelopment.\nFiji acknowledges the support rendered to us by\nthe United Nations and by Member States in the\ndeployment of the United Nations electoral observation\nteam during our elections. The team discharged its\nduties professionally and impartially. We are confident\nthat it will provide the Assembly with a positive\nappraisal of the conduct of the elections as free and\nfair \u2014 conduct to which we have been well\naccustomed throughout our electoral history.\nI should like to convey my Government\u2019s deep\ngratitude to those Member States that supported Fiji\nand to those that sponsored resolution 55/280, which\nenabled the participation of the United Nations\nobserver team.\nOur leaders are committed, under the Millennium\nDeclaration of 2000, to the principles of human dignity,\nequality and equity, especially with respect to those\nwho are most vulnerable, in particular the children,\nwho are our future. It is a timely and constructive\ncommitment that creates the necessary global\nframework for addressing the plight of the poor and the\nvulnerable in the face of the accelerating impact of\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\nPoverty is at the root of many problems. As the\nmost powerful destabilizing force, it threatens\ndemocracy and good governance. It is thus our most\ninsidious enemy. Successive Human Development\nReports amply document abysmal accounts of poverty\nand poverty indicators. A total of 1.2 billion people\nlive on less than $1 a day, more than a billion people in\ndeveloping countries lack access to safe water, and\nmore than 2.4 billion people lack adequate sanitation.\nWe are talking not millions, but billions.\nPoverty reduction is therefore our greatest\nchallenge today. The Millennium Declaration set a\ntarget to halve global extreme poverty by 2015. This\ngoal must be the cornerstone of all development\nefforts. It demands an ongoing commitment and\neffective measures on the part of the international\ncommunity.\nIn this connection, my Government has created a\nnew Ministry for Poverty Alleviation, which is a key\npolicy factor in our triennial Strategic Development\nPlan. We recognize that economic, social and political\nstability are inextricably tied to reducing the gap\nbetween rich and poor. That equation must also\nrecognize the unique vulnerabilities that beset the\nfragile economies of developing countries such as Fiji.\nComplementary legislation is also being\ndeveloped in the Social Justice Bill to translate into\npolicy the constitutional provision for social equity.\nPrimarily, the Bill will regulate affirmative action\npolicies for disadvantaged groups in the areas and in\nthe manner prescribed in the Fiji Constitution. This is a\ncritical step in Fiji\u2019s efforts towards national unity and\nnation-building and its efforts to address issues of\nsocial, ethnic and economic development and harmony.\n26\n\nToday, in our journey in this world, we are\nmeeting with unprecedented challenges and\nuncertainties, ranging from widespread global conflict\nto escalating terrorist activities and economic\nmarginalization. The Assembly and the United Nations\nsystem must devise appropriate, creative responses to\nthese difficult questions, in ways that are compatible\nwith the goals of world peace and security, as\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nCurrent organizational reform plans present\nconstructive and necessary platforms for meeting these\nspecific challenges. An amicable agreement on the\nexpansion of the permanent or non-permanent\nmembership of the Security Council could well present\nus with new and fresh avenues for solutions. My\ndelegation reiterates our full support for an expansion\nof both membership categories of the Security Council.\nWe congratulate the Security Council on the support\nthat its landmark resolution 1325 (2000) received, a\nresolution whose implementation will allow for\nincreased involvement on the part of women in the\nprocess of achieving peace and security.\nFiji has excelled in its efforts to achieve the\npeacekeeping goals of the United Nations Charter. We\nremain fully committed to this goal and to the Brahimi\nrecommendations for reform. Our military is serving in\nvarious United Nations missions, including in Lebanon,\nEast Timor and Kuwait. Our police officers are serving\nin Bosnia and Kosovo. It is gratifying to see positive\nconclusions to several peacekeeping mandates and their\nimpending withdrawal or downsizing. We would\ncaution, however, against any exit without strategy, in\norder to give credence to the huge investment of\ngoodwill and resources by the United Nations and the\ninternational community, and to avoid a situation of\ndouble jeopardy for the people trapped in armed\nconflict.\nIn this regard, we support new measures to\nstrengthen the protective regime of the Convention on\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\nIts scope needs to include United Nations and\nhumanitarian personnel on the ground, who need real\nprotection and security while working to ensure the\nsafety of, and caring for, civilians.\nFiji has consistently advocated decolonization\nand self-determination since joining the United\nNations. We note the delay in the implementation of\nthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\nColonial Countries and Peoples. Fiji supports the\nongoing work of the Committee of 24 and recognizes\nthe political and diplomatic constraints involved.\nEarly on in this Second Decade for the\nEradication of Colonialism, the 17 Non-Self-Governing\nTerritories, mostly small island Territories in the\nCaribbean and Pacific regions, need our focused\nattention, so that their legitimate aspirations for self-\ndetermination can be recognized.\nThe Declaration of Commitment on the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic demands that we exercise greater\nvigilance and focus sincerely on safeguarding our\ndevelopment gains and on our future goals. We in the\nPacific are seeking to maintain our low infection rate\ntrend, as we stand to lose the most if we fail to abide\nby that Declaration. Only collaboration and solidarity\nat the international, regional and national levels can\nsave humanity from this invasive scourge.\nDespite the recent political disturbances in Fiji,\nrespect for the rule of law and for international human\nrights standards has been maintained. The continued\nexistence and independence of the Fiji Human Rights\nCommission is testimony to our commitment to human\nrights.\nFiji, along with several of its Pacific Island\nneighbours, is for the first time facing the dilemmas\nposed by refugees and asylum seekers. International\nhuman trafficking has brought them to our shores,\ndespite the vast distances between our lands.\nInternational refugees are the direct result of violations\nand breaches of human rights. As a State party to the\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and to its\nProtocol, Fiji pleads with Member States to respect the\nrights of refugees and to support the work of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. At the very\nleast, Member States are obligated to protect the rights\nof their citizens in their own homeland.\nFiji co-sponsored the resolution on Korean peace,\nsecurity and reunification during the fifty-fifth session\nof the General Assembly. We are elated to see peace\nand reunification initiatives in the Korean peninsula.\nLikewise, the small island developing States are\nseeking continually to enhance our international\nparticipation. Strengthening future relations between\nthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum is a\nmutually beneficial avenue. This will allow for our\neffective participation in the United Nations system. It\n27\n\nalso affords the United Nations with a unique and\nauthentic Pacific perspective and voice. Cooperation\nbetween the Pacific Islands Forum and the United\nNations is a welcome addition to this session\u2019s agenda\nand promises greater returns, with the support of\nMember States.\nOur Pacific Islands Forum leaders will meet in\nFiji in 2002. It is therefore opportune to renew our\ninvitation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, to\nvisit the Pacific Islands Forum region. Recent political\nevents in the Pacific and the successful domestic,\nregional and international initiatives to address these\nconcerns can only be positively reinforced by such a\nhigh-level, goodwill visit by the Secretary-General, to\ntake place early, rather than later, in his second term of\noffice.\nOur global development agenda demands of the\nUnited Nations an increased facilitating role in the\ncoordination of economic, financial, trade and social\nissues. At the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development in March 2002, stakeholders will\ndeliberate on enhancing coherence and coordination\nbetween development and social objectives. Fiji hopes\nthat the Conference will inspire the international\ncommunity and financial institutions, including the\nBretton Woods institutions, to support and devise new\nstandards and indicators, such as the vulnerability\nindex, to effectively address poverty and other\ndisparities.\nGrowing imbalances and marginalization in the\nworld economy are a threat to humanity, in particular\nto Fiji and other small island developing States (SIDS).\nSustainable development depends on a given level of\nresources to propel our fragile economies forward.\nMoreover, these resources are needed to sustain long-\nterm, sound, economic and environmentally friendly\ndevelopment. The critical role of the international\ncommunity is to assist us in nation-building and\nefficient resource utilization so that we can fulfil our\nsocial obligations.\nFiji has long expounded to the international\ncommunity how vulnerable and heavily dependent our\neconomies are on the vagaries and whims of the global\neconomy. Our small size, extremely remote distance\nfrom the international markets and increasing\nsusceptibility to natural disasters do not lend\nthemselves well to economies of scale of production, to\nbuilding export-based trade or to gaining competitive\naccess to foreign markets for our products. Clearly, our\nability to benefit fully from globalization is doomed\nfrom the start, further aggravating the divide between\nthe rich and poor. It is my Government\u2019s aspiration that\nthe scope of equitable and tangible benefits from\nglobalization and trade liberalization is still to be fully\nrealized if we are to meaningfully tackle global and\nhuman poverty.\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization,\nFiji is concerned at the fast erosion of trade preferences\nin the world trade in agricultural products, sugar being\na mainstay of our economy. Increasingly, we fear that\nsmall island States like my own, which depend\npredominantly on agricultural export commodities, will\nbe seriously affected without adequate market\nsafeguards. We are forced to question the efficacy of a\nmultilateral trade framework as a fair mechanism in\npromoting the interests of SIDS like Fiji.\nIn this context, we welcome the current work on\nfinancing for development and preparations for the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Targeted\nassistance and official development assistance\nprogrammes to enable us to fully implement and\nstrengthen investment and productivity must\nnecessarily complement our efforts through regional or\nmultilateral trading agreements. We are optimistic that\nnext year\u2019s high-level conferences will flag our\nconcerns in line with the Barbados Programme of\nAction and the development goals that are set out in the\nMillennium Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate you,\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Your\nelection is a clear manifestation of the entire\nmembership\u2019s confidence in and high regard for your\nable leadership and diplomatic skills. We wish you\nsuccess in the tasks ahead. I want to assure you of my\ndelegation\u2019s full cooperation and support.\nOur salutations are also extended to your\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for a job\nwell done.\nAllow me also to sincerely congratulate\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on the able and\ndistinguished manner in which he has continued to\nadminister and guide the affairs of our Organization.\nHis re-election to a second term attests to the\nconfidence and trust that we have in him. The award of\nthis year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize to him and the United\nNations is recognition of his personal attributes and\ncontributions to strengthening the world body. It is also\nrecognition of the glorious performance and\nachievements of the United Nations in the search of\nglobal peace, solidarity and prosperity.\nAs we applaud and pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations for their remarkable\nachievements, the horrific terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember against the United States are a clear\nreminder to us all that the fight for lasting world peace\nis far from being won. Strangely enough, the fight can\ntake new dangerous dimensions when aeroplanes,\nwhich are a magnificent human invention for the fast\nmovement of people, goods and services between\ndistant places, can themselves become weapons in\nterror attacks.\nComing from a country that fell victim to a\nterrorist attack with the bombing of the United States\nEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998, I can clearly\nunderstand the pain, anger and quest for revenge on the\npart of President George Bush, his Administration and\nthe people of the United States of America. On that\nfateful day, when 11 of our fellow citizen\u2019s perished\nand over 70 people were wounded, the Government\nand people of my country felt exactly the same. We\ntherefore perceive and share the pain and grief of the\npeople of the United States and support their right and\nthat of their Government to seek redresses and fight the\nperpetrators of this heinous crime.\nTerrorism is a horrendous crime in its brutality\nand victimization. It is wanton, cruel and\nindiscriminate. The world must work together to fight\nand defeat it. Allow me to reiterate Tanzania\u2019s pledges,\nresolve and readiness to continue to participate fully in\nthe efforts to combat terrorism.\nThe events of 11 September remind us once more\nof the need to expedite the process establishing the\nInternational Criminal Court.\nAllow me also to convey sincere sympathy to the\nfamilies of the deceased in yesterday\u2019s tragic plane\ncrash. Our thoughts and prayers are with them in this\ntime of grief.\nThis is the first session of the General Assembly\nafter the Millennium Summit held here last year. At\nthat Summit, the world leaders defined the agenda and\nstrategies of our Organization in the new century.\nThere was common understanding in the new century, a\nresolve to continue to work together to tackle the\nnumerous problems bequeathed by the last century. It is\nthe view of my delegation that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly and the subsequent ones should\ntranslate that commitment into concrete actions.\nPermit me at this juncture to share with the\nAssembly some thoughts about what could be the\nimportant priorities of the United Nations. Tanzania\n11\n\nwould like to see a United Nations that continues to be\nthe guarantor of world peace and security, a United\nNations that has the development agenda at the centre\nof its main objectives and activities and a United\nNations that continues to fight for justice and equality\namong peoples and nations the world over.\nStrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations\nis an imperative we all agreed to undertake almost a\ndecade ago. We have done a remarkable job as regards\nthe restructuring of the Secretariat and the United\nNations agencies. It is regrettable that reform and\nrestructuring of the Security Council remain elusive. A\nprocess started seven years ago has yet to bear the\ndesired result. The disturbing thing is the fact that in\nsome quarters it no longer appears to be a priority\nsubject.\nTanzania believes that expansion of Security\nCouncil membership in both categories is as relevant\nand desirable today as it was seven years ago. We\nwould like to reaffirm our support for the principle of\nequitable representation of Member States on the basis\nof their geographical regions. In particular, we want to\nreiterate support for Africa\u2019s request for two seats in\nthe permanent category. As the continent with the\nlargest portion of the membership of our Organization,\nsuch a representation is well deserved. We also think\nthat the time has come to have a serious look at the\ncircumstances and modalities for invoking the use of\nveto powers. We are of the view that the veto power\nshould be used in pursuit of global interests, and not\nnarrow national interests.\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders\nemphasized that the development agenda should\ncontinue to be at the centre of the objectives and\nactivities of the United Nations. We know that the\nUnited Nations is not a major funding institution, but\nover the years it has been the moral force behind the\nmany difficult decisions taken to address serious\neconomic issues. The United Nations organized several\nforums where various development agenda items were\ndiscussed and continue to be discussed, and decisions\ntaken. We want the United Nations to continue to do\nthat.\nIn a period of global economic slow-down like\nthe one we are witnessing today, the task of forging\nnew strategies to tackle the intractable problems of\npoverty, hunger, disease, deprivation and\nenvironmental degradation becomes very challenging\nindeed. We hope the current economic crisis will not\nlast long, because if it does its consequences may be\nbad for us all, especially the developing countries. I\nwould also add that Africa, as a continent with 34 of\nthe 48 least developed countries, will suffer the most.\nIn view of this situation, this world body, donor\ncountries and least developed countries must muster\ncollective efforts to ensure that these problems and\nmany more are addressed collectively. I know that\nthere can never be quick fixes to resolving such\nproblems. However, building those kinds of\npartnerships is one thing that the United Nations should\nhelp realize.\nThere is no doubt that for development to make\nsense in the context of the developing countries like\nTanzania, the availability of official development\nassistance (ODA), plus long-term capital flows and\naccess to technology and markets of the developed\ncountries, are essential. These will have a catalytic role\nin building domestic supply capacity.\nWe are particularly concerned that the situation\nwith regard to availability of ODA is still not\nencouraging. Most developed countries are far from\nmeeting the target of contributing 0.7 per cent of their\ngross domestic product to ODA, as agreed way back in\n1970 and reiterated at the 1992 Rio Summit. What is\nmore disturbing to us is the fact that the decline\ncontinues unabated despite numerous appeals. My\ndelegation would once again like to use this\nopportunity to call upon the developed countries to\nhonour this historic duty to mankind. We hope the\nUnited Nations will remain seized of the matter and\nexercise leadership.\nThe flow of foreign direct investment (FDI),\nwhich is so essential for inducing growth in our\nnations, leaves much to be desired. So far, the flow of\nFDI is not as we would have wanted or have expected\nit to be.\nThe painful part of this problem is the fact that\nmany of our countries have done everything that has\nbeen demanded of us in order to create a conducive\nenvironment for FDI to flow, yet there is not much of it\ncoming. Take the example of my country, where we\nhave established, through an Act of Parliament, a\nfinancial, legal and institutional framework as\nattractive and competitive as one would find anywhere\nin the world. We have a sound macroeconomic\nenvironment; there is political stability; and good\n12\n\ngovernance and democracy are vibrant, yet foreign\ndirect investment flows are minimal.\nMy country\u2019s experience is the experience of\nmany countries in the developing world. We are at a\nloss as to what else we have to do. Maybe someone\nwill volunteer to tell us. While we continue to appeal to\nthe developed countries to do more, we request the\nindulgence of the United Nations. In this regard, we\nwelcome and support the convening of the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held next March. We hope that the\nquestion of ODA and FDI will be given appropriate\nconsideration. I promise Tanzania\u2019s full participation in\nthat Conference.\nEasy access by the developing countries to the\ntechnology and markets of the developed world could\ncontribute immensely towards the alleviation and\neventual eradication of poverty in the world. There are\nencouraging developments in the area of market access,\nwith initiatives such as the Africa Growth and\nOpportunity Act (AGOA), which allows over 1,800\nproducts from countries of sub-Saharan Africa to enter\nthe United States market duty-free and quota-free, and\nthe Cotonou Agreement, which allows everything but\narms from the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and\nthe Pacific to enter the European Union duty-free and\nquota-free.\nWe hope the initiatives taken by Japan under the\nTokyo International Conference on African\nDevelopment (TICAD) and by the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina under the China-Africa Cooperation Forum will\ngo a little further and offer opportunities similar to\nthose offered under AGOA and the Cotonou\nAgreement. It is our sincere hope and expectation that\nthe four aforementioned initiatives by the United\nStates, the European Union, China and Japan will also\nease the difficulties experienced by our countries in\naccessing the financial, scientific and technological\nresources available in those nations. While our nations\nwill continue to engage the developed countries\nbilaterally or collectively in various forums, the United\nNations should never lose sight of the need to help us.\nThe problem of the external debt of developing\ncountries, and particularly of the least developed\ncountries, continues to pose a serious challenge to the\ndevelopment efforts of those countries. External debt\nservicing has been crowding out priority social\ninvestments in our respective countries. In Tanzania,\nfor example, debt servicing averaged one-third of the\nentire Government\u2019s budget. With another one-third\nspent on payment of salaries, the Government is left\nwith only a third of the budget to perform its duties,\nwhich range from maintaining law and order to the\nprovision of basic social and economic services. This\nclearly underscores the fact that debt relief and debt\nforgiveness for nations like mine will go a long way\ntowards enhancing Government capacity to discharge\nits duties.\nIn this regard, Tanzania welcomes the various\nmeasures undertaken by the international community\naimed at dealing with this chronic debt problem. Our\nonly concern is that, despite all these measures, the\nscope and magnitude of debt is continuing to build up\nto dangerous proportions. More surgical measures\nshould therefore be taken to deal more effectively with\nthis crippling problem.\nLet me now turn to issues related to peace and\nsecurity. At the outset, let me state that it is\nheartwarming to see the Security Council more\nengaged in the process of trying to tackle the crisis in\nthe Great Lakes region. The Government of Tanzania is\ncommitted to building a secure and stable Great Lakes\nregion. In this regard, I want to assure the United\nNations that we will continue to play a positive role, as\nwe have been doing, in order to help the people of\nBurundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nsecure and enjoy the peace which they so richly\ndeserve.\nIt is encouraging to note that in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, despite difficulties, the\nimplementation of the Lusaka Agreement is on track.\nWe are particularly glad that the inter-Congolese\ndialogue is under way. I would like to use this\nopportunity to appeal to the parties to the conflict to\nstay the course. We also appeal to the Security Council\nto remain seized of the matter, and to the international\ncommunity to extend the urgently needed financial\nresources to the facilitation of the dialogue.\nWe welcome the installation of the Transitional\nGovernment in Burundi. We hope that this historic\nevent, which marks the successful conclusion of long\nand arduous political negotiations, is also the\nbeginning of an irreversible process that will put an\nend to the long years of pain and suffering endured by\nthe people of Burundi. Indeed, the subregion continues\nto work towards the cessation of hostilities and towards\n13\n\nultimately securing a ceasefire agreement between the\nrebels and the Government. In this respect, I would like\nto take this opportunity to say three things.\nFirst, let me reiterate Tanzania\u2019s previous calls\nfor the leaders of the Front for the Defence of\nDemocracy (FDD) and the National Liberation Forces\n(FNL) to see reason and to join the Arusha process. I\nbelieve that there is nothing they are fighting for which\nhas not been discussed and decided upon in the Arusha\nAgreement. Even if they feel strongly that something\nhas been excluded, the Arusha Agreement provides\nopportunities for discussion of the same by the parties.\nSecondly, Tanzania promises its readiness to\nwork with the new Government and to do all it can to\nhelp it succeed. We are ready to work with the new\nAdministration in Bujumbura and with the Front for\nDemocracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) to engage the\nrebels and encourage them to join the Arusha\nAgreement.\nThe third issue I would like to address relates to\nthe repatriation of Burundi refugees living in Tanzania.\nIt need not be emphasized that the return of refugees to\ntheir homeland is a crucial element in the healing and\nnormalization process in that troubled country. As host\nto over 800,000 refugees from Burundi, Tanzania\nexpects repatriation of these refugees to be among the\ntop priority issues in the implementation of the Arusha\nAgreement. It is our sincere hope that, in that exercise,\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) will include not only the half a\nmillion people in the camps that they manage in\nKigoma and Ngara, but also the earlier caseloads of\nabout 300,000 they left to Tanzania to manage.\nIt is sad that Savimbi and his renegade UNITA\ncontinue to be a menace in Angola. The United Nations\nand the international community should do more to\nstop this menace. If action could be taken in Kosovo\nand Sierra Leone against criminal leaders, why not do\nthe same against Savimbi and UNITA? I believe it can\nbe done. Let us muster the political courage.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Tanzania\nreiterates its long-held position that this is a question of\ndecolonization and that the Sahrawi people have a right\nto decide on their future through a referendum, as\nstipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe fear that abandoning that path could lead to\nuntoward events.\nIt is regrettable that the situation in the Middle\nEast remains volatile and explosive. It is our hope that\nthe peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel\nwill be revived through a resolute commitment by all\nparties. The United Nations has a major role in\nensuring that the peace process gets back on track. The\ncommitment made by President Bush on the creation of\nthe state of Palestine on the basis of Security Council\nresolutions is very reassuring. We hope this will be\nfollowed through and that the United States\nGovernment will once again assume its leadership role.\nAs host country to the International Criminal\nTribunal for Rwanda, we cannot but reiterate our call\nfor continued support for the Tribunal. It is gratifying\nthat the Tribunal\u2019s mission of bringing to justice those\nresponsible for the genocide in Rwanda is well under\nway. Contrary to previous negative publicity, the\nTribunal is increasingly obtaining the appreciation and\ncredit it deserves for its work.\nI would be remiss if I were to conclude my\nremarks without saying a word about the debilitating\ndisease of HIV/AIDS. The impact of this worldwide\nscourge is not only a major scientific and medical\nchallenge, but a threat to the very existence of\nhumanity. Our leaders at the June special session\ndedicated to HIV/AIDS pronounced themselves on this\nscourge and on their resolve to fight it. Let me express\nour appreciation for the leadership role of the United\nNations, particularly the Secretary-General\u2019s\ncommitment to combat this global crisis, from which\nno corner of this world is safe.\nI believe that, with resolute political will, the war\nagainst this world pandemic is not insurmountable.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThere is a lot of talk\nfloating around regarding some catchwords: the \u201cnew\ninternational order\u201d, \u201cglobalization\u201d, the \u201cglobal\nvillage\u201d and so forth. All of these ebullient, self-\ngratifying positions are, apparently, due to the end of\nthe cold war between the Western countries and the\nformer Soviet Union. Of course, the end of the\ndangerous and misguided rivalry between communism\nand capitalism is welcome and has, indeed, opened\nsome new opportunities, if fully utilized by all\nconcerned.\nHowever, it must be pointed out unequivocally\nthat many of the problems in the world today predate\nthe cold war; they predate the onset of communism in\nRussia in 1917. The slave trade started in the 1440s\nalong the West African coast. A shift from bleeding\nAfrica through slavery to resident colonialism was\nordained in Berlin in 1884. That was long before\ncommunism took over in Russia. Therefore the cold\nwar could not have been responsible for these mistakes\nand for the complications they created, many of which\nwe are still grappling with today, especially in Africa.\nTherefore, the euphoria that followed the end of\nthe cold war was not wholly justified. The song about\nglobalization, as I have pointed out repeatedly, is not a\nnew tune at all. Africans were globalized as slaves all\nover all over the world in the 1440s. My Christian\nname is Joel, actually a Jewish name, so I am already\nglobalized. Many of my countrymen have got Arab\nnames like Azizi and Musa because they are Muslims.\nWe were globalized long ago in Africa. Unfortunately,\nthough, that globalization movement was parasitic. It\nwas a parasitic globalization movement; it was not a\nsymbiotic globalization movement. Therefore the only\nnew question we can legitimately and usefully ask is:\nWill the new phase of globalization be less parasitic\nand more symbiotic, or not? That is the question. Will\nthe new globalization be to everybody\u2019s mutual benefit,\nor will it be the old story of parasitism on a global\nscale?\nThe parasitism in the world is not the sole\nresponsibility of those who benefit from inequality.\nEven the victims have always contributed to their\nmarginalization by their own wrong aims and\nmethods \u2014 before colonization, during colonization\nand, even, after colonization. Myopic African chiefs\nwere the main facilitators of the slave trade. Until very\nrecently the Europeans did not possess the\ntechnological means to subdue the African continent as\nfar as means of transport \u2014 that is to say, railways \u2014\nweapons or medicine were concerned. Without the\nfratricidal, brother-against-brother wars fomented by\nAfrican chiefs, neither the slave trade nor colonialism\nwould have been possible. We would have defeated the\ncolonialists and forced them, right from the beginning,\nto cooperate with us to everybody\u2019s mutual benefit.\nWeakness on the side of the potential victim always\ntempts the aggressor. The aggressor is always\nencouraged by the weakness of the potential victim.\n9\n\nEven today, however, the authorship of the\ninequality among peoples is still a joint responsibility\nof the victims \u2014 who in this case are Africans, Arabs\nand other marginalized peoples \u2014 of the parasitic\nglobalization movement that is now 500 years old, on\nthe one hand, and the beneficiaries of this hitherto\nunequal and, in the past, evil movement, on the other\nhand. Both the victims and the beneficiaries of the\nparasitic globalization movement are responsible for\nthis situation. The beneficiaries of the hitherto parasitic\nglobalization movement have been the North\nAmericans, the Europeans and the Japanese.\nFor a variety of reasons, some formerly colonized\npeoples \u2014 such as the Indians, Indonesians, Pakistanis,\nSouth-East Asians and Native Americans \u2014 and\nformerly semi-colonized peoples, such as the Chinese,\nhave made significant upward movements that are\nhelping, slowly but surely, to even out the balance of\npower in the world. Some other peoples, however, on\naccount of a number of endogenous and exogenous\nfactors, are still living as the wretched of the Earth.\nMany Africans and some Arabs fall into this category\nof the still-unredeemed of the Earth. As I have said, the\nunredeemed are so categorized partly on account of\ntheir own internal mistakes \u2014 such as sectarianism,\nxenophobia, unprincipled conflicts, the strangulation of\nfree enterprise, the political balkanization of their\nregions, the strangulation of political freedoms and so\non \u2014 and partly on account of still very unfavourable\nexogenous factors. The most unfavourable such factor\nis the lack of access by these countries to markets in\nNorth America, the European Union, Japan, China,\nIndia and Russia.\nThe song about aid is meaningless without access\nto markets. Aid without access to markets is\nmeaningless. All protectionism must end, especially in\nthe countries of the Organization for Economic\nCooperation in Europe (OECD). Subsidies to the\nfarmers of Europe must end, if we are talking of a\nglobal village of symbiosis, and not parasitism. I\ncommend the American Government and President\nGeorge Bush for the recent African Growth and\nOpportunity Act (AGOA) initiative. Although Uganda\nhas not yet benefited from AGOA on account of our\nendogenous weaknesses, which have been accentuated\nby the blurred views of our partners in the multilateral\ninstitutions, other African countries have started\nbenefit, such as Kenya, Madagascar, Lesotho, Nigeria\nand South Africa. This is good. The African Growth\nand Opportunity Act enunciated by the American\nGovernment is the first good news I have heard in a\nlong time. The Americans are at last beginning to\nchange their image of being parasitic global villagers.\nThe Europeans must catch up with the Americans\nin shedding this uncomplimentary label. Although they\nhave talked about \u201ceverything but guns\u201d going into\nEurope from Africa, they are still giving subsidies to\nartificial farmers in Europe. As a consequence of the\n$1.2 trillion value of global trade in agricultural\nproducts, Africa gets only about $20 billion \u2014 if the\nrecent results of the African Growth and Opportunity\nAct (AGOA) are included; that is about 2 per cent of\nthe total. So of the total value of agricultural trade,\nAfrica only gets 2 per cent. At the same time, the\ncountries of the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) are spending\n$361 billion on artificial subsidies for farmers of those\ncountries. Yet these are the countries that evangelize in\nthe name of free trade. The preachers of free trade are\npractising incredibly expensive protectionism. What an\nunfortunate paradox. These double standards must end.\nAfrica has removed some of the old impediments,\nsome of the old endogenous factors, to private\ninvestment. The sanctity of private property is now\nalmost a universal concept in Africa. Nationalization of\nprivate enterprises is no more. Some of the African\ncountries have a consistently stable macroeconomic\nframework. Inflation in Uganda is now negative 0.3 per\ncent. The African currencies are now convertible; a\nlarge part of Africa is very peaceful; infrastructure is\nreasonable; and democracy is widely practised in\nAfrica today. We are even addressing the issue of the\nexcessive political Balkanization of the continent,\nwhich has 53 States, compared to 3 States in the whole\nNorth American continent.\nWe are handling this in a variety of ways,\nincluding through economic blocs like the Southern\nAfrica Development Community in southern Africa,\nthe Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\nin East and Central Africa and the Economic\nCommunity of West African States in western Africa.\nThe world needs to encourage these positive trends in\nAfrica by opening up their markets on a quota-free,\ntariff-free basis. This will, ipso facto, force\nmultinational investors to rush to Africa and invest\nthere. They are already doing so just by the limited\nAGOA measures by the Americans. With more\ncivilized aims and methods, balanced world\n10\n\ndevelopment is possible and desirable for everybody,\nincluding OECD citizens who are forced to eat inferior\nfoods and are taxed to protect those poor-quality foods\nagainst better foods from Africa.\nWhenever I travel abroad, I pack my own\nUgandan foods \u2014 milk, millet flour, fruits, legumes,\nchicken, honey and plantain bananas, called matooke in\nour language. The other day, on my way here, my\npineapple stocks ran out and my staff bought\npineapples from a supermarket in the United Kingdom.\nI took just one slice and terminated the whole exercise\nat once. First of all, the pineapple was hard. I had never\nseen a hard pineapple until I saw that one in London. It\nwas less sweet and had an ammonia-like pungent taste.\nI had had the same experience in Washington once.\nThey brought something they called a pineapple. I\ncould not believe it. Why must citizens of the world\nendure these deprivations on account of policies\ndesigned to serve narrow interests? Why must this be?\nI will not eat pineapple again until I go back to\nUganda.\nThe oppressors, the colonialists and those who\nsought to control the destiny of others used barbaric\nmethods: genocide, forced labour, ethnocide and so on.\nIt is amazing, therefore, that some of those who claim\nto be fighting for the liberation of oppressed peoples\nalso use barbaric means such as terrorism. In the\nongoing debate on terrorism I have not heard anybody\nbothering to define the difference between a freedom\nfighter and a terrorist. What is the difference between a\nfreedom fighter and a terrorist? Mzee Nelson\nMandela \u2014 \u201cMzee\u201d means someone who is dignified\nand elderly \u2014 was a freedom fighter until recently.\nWas he a terrorist? Not at all. Did anyone hear that Mr.\nMandela had hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in a\nrestaurant? But Mr. Mandela was a freedom fighter. He\nwas not a terrorist. The difference between a terrorist\nand a freedom fighter lies in the fact that while a\nfreedom fighter sometimes may be forced to use\nviolence, he cannot use indiscriminate violence. The\nperson who uses indiscriminate violence is a terrorist.\nA freedom fighter may sometimes be forced to use\nviolence.\nI was forced to use violence against Idi Amin.\nBut I never hijacked a plane. It was never heard that\nMuseveni hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in a bar.\nPeople in bars are not politicians. Some of them just go\nthere to make merry. What kind of revolutionary is\nsomeone who kills such people? The person who uses\nindiscriminate violence is a terrorist. A terrorist does\nnot differentiate between combatants and non-\ncombatants, between civilians and servicemen and\nbetween armed servicemen and unarmed servicemen.\nEven if someone is a soldier, if he is off duty, he should\nnot be attacked, if one claims to be a freedom fighter.\nHe should not be attacked. It is against the laws of war.\nThe terrorist fights a war without declaring one. That is\nwhy terrorists hijack planes, plant bombs in populated\ncentres and so forth.\nWe normally get technical advice from other parts\nof the world. The Europeans always come to give us\ntechnical advice. I would like to give you technical\nadvice about freedom-fighting. We have done very well\nin that. In Africa, since 1961, we have fought wars of\nliberation in Mozambique against the Portuguese; in\nAngola against the Portuguese; in Guinea-Bissau\nagainst the Portuguese; in Zimbabwe against minority\nwhites; in South Africa against minority whites; in\nNamibia against minority whites; and in Uganda\nagainst Idi Amin. There was a criminal called Idi Amin\nwhom we had to fight. However, we never used\nterrorism. This is on the record. We always fought\ncombatant to combatant. Quite a number of times our\ncomrades used mass action: strikes, demonstrations,\npetitions, diplomatic struggle and so on. Not a single\nplane was hijacked by African freedom fighters,\nalthough there were anti-colonial wars in all these\ncountries.\nTerrorist actions are misguided and criminal and\nmust be opposed by all as a matter of principle. Africa\nwas beginning to benefit from AGOA, the measure\ntaken by the Americans to open their markets to our\ngoods. Business has, however, now somewhat slumped\nin America. Therefore, the terrorists, who claim to be\nfighting for the Palestinian cause, are objectively\nhurting the interests of Africans, who have always been\nthe allies of the Palestinians. This is counter-\nproductive. The terrorists have also tried to polarize the\nworld, pitting Moslems against Christians. This is\nerroneous and unacceptable. Exploitation knows no\nboundaries and cuts across all races and religions.\nExploiters are found in all religions and races. The\nArabs had to oppose Turkish imperialism. Yet both the\nArabs and the Turks were Muslims. Why, then, did\nthey have to oppose each other? One of the monsters of\nthe last century, Idi Amin, of my country, was a\nMuslim. We had to get rid of him to liberate everybody,\nincluding the Muslims, in Uganda. War has been going\n11\n\non in the Sudan for decades. Elements that claim to be\nacting in the name of Islam have been the ones taking\nthe wrong position in this conflict, seeking hegemony\nover God\u2019s people.\nI, therefore, support the position of the United\nStates on this occasion, as we did in the Gulf War, in\nfighting and defeating these reactionaries, who profane\nthe name of freedom fighters. If necessary, all countries\nof the world opposed to terrorism should contribute\ntroops and finish the job quickly. The coalition against\nterrorism should be regarded in the same way as the\ncoalition against fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.\nNevertheless, the just aspirations of the\nPalestinian people and of other oppressed peoples, like\nthe people of southern Sudan, must be supported so\nthat we can get peaceful resolutions to these conflicts. I\nwelcome freedom and equality for all peoples of the\nworld. Those who strive to dominate or exploit others\nhave illegitimate ambitions. We now have a chance to\nbuild a new, just world. The free will of all peoples\nshould be ensured. In addition, the most important\ninstrument of emancipation, free trade, should give\nAfrican goods quota- and tariff-free access to the\nmarkets of the countries of the Organization for\nCooperation and Development (OECD) and vice versa.\nAfrica is beginning to tame its conflicts. The\nconflict in Lesotho was resolved by an African\nmechanism. Recently, the Arusha Agreement on Peace\nand Reconciliation ended the conflict in Burundi. It is\npossible to resolve our age-old problems and finally\nbecome part of the new world order rather than mere\nspectators of the process.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\njoin the delegations that preceded me in congratulating\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to preside over the\nproceedings of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly, being held at an especially complicated\nmoment in international life. His long and brilliant\ncareer as an eminent diplomat and distinguished\nstatesman in his country assures us that his term as\nPresident of the Assembly will be a productive one, as\nhas been clearly evident since this session was\nconvened. I assure him that he can count on the full\ncooperation of the delegation of Cape Verde.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\nI wish to express our recognition of the skill and\nefficiency with which he managed the major global\nissues that came before this lofty forum during the\nprevious session, particularly during the Millennium\nSummit.\nMy delegation is also pleased with the re-election\nof Mr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General of the United\nNations. The unanimity of his re-election reflects the\ntremendous prestige he has gained in the international\ncommunity because of his vision, as well as the trust\nplaced in him to pursue the reforms under way and to\nconsolidate the prestige of the United Nations.\nLike the delegations that preceded me, I also wish\nto take this opportunity to reiterate my congratulations\nto the United Nations and its Secretary-General as joint\nrecipients of the Nobel Peace Prize, an award that\nreinforces their moral authority, so necessary in these\nturbulent times. This distinction, both well-deserved\nand heartening, helps emphasize the importance of the\n29\n\nwork of our Organization, under the enlightened\nguidance of Mr. Annan, in fostering an international\natmosphere conducive to a more just, tolerant and\nmutually supportive world.\nThis is a gigantic and complex task, undertaken\nin the midst of enormous difficulties and risks and\ncontinually posing new challenges to our collective\nmind as we search for solutions to large and ever-\ngrowing problems that humanity must solve.\nNow, when international peace and security are\nseriously threatened, that recent honour not only\nconstitutes well-deserved recognition of a high degree\nof dedication to the cause of peace and the prevention\nand resolution of conflicts; it also bears a message of\nhope that the shining ideals of justice, democracy,\nhuman rights and development for all will shape the\nentire world to the benefit of future generations.\nWe in our country understand and properly\nappreciate the role and the importance of the United\nNations. It was partly due to the persistent and\nunconditional support of the United Nations that our\nstruggle for national liberation culminated in success,\nwith the proclamation of our independence. It was\ncertainly due to the support of the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies that Cape Verde has been able\nto take important steps on the road to development and\nshow encouraging signs of progress, year after year, as\ndocumented in the Human Development Reports of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\nThe tragedy that recently struck the homeland of\nthe United States of America, causing the loss of\nthousands of innocent lives and destroying one of the\nmost prestigious landmarks in this city, can only be the\nobject of our most vehement and total condemnation.\nThe United States is home to the largest overseas\nCape Verdean community. That part of our diaspora has\nalso felt violated by the barbarous attacks of 11\nSeptember, and along with them, my country and,\nindeed, all Cape Verdeans share in the mourning and\nthe distress experienced by the American people and\nfamilies of so many other nationalities.\nCape Verde has stood ready from the outset to\nsupport actions intended to combat terrorism, in the\ncontext of a broad international coalition under the\nauspices of the United Nations. Therefore, my\nGovernment is committed to implementing Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) to combat this scourge.\nImportant steps have already been taken, particularly\nregarding the endorsement of international anti-\nterrorism instruments.\nWe believe that all States have a moral and\ncollective obligation to fight the perversion of the\nhuman spirit represented by this phenomenon. The\nseriousness and the scope of the 11 September terrorist\nacts show that, from now on, terrorism must be\nconfronted resolutely, with appropriate responses and\npreventive action, in order to stem the criminal\nviolence that masquerades as being prompted by\npolitical or religious motivations.\nNo country is safe from similar attacks or from\nattempts to use its own territory for the perpetration of\nterrorist acts. Therefore, any strategy designed to\npermanently eliminate this dangerous threat to\ninternational peace and stability must be a common\none, with broad participation, in which the United\nNations plays a crucial role.\nIn participating in the global effort to eliminate\nterrorism, the developing countries are, once again, at a\nserious disadvantage. On the one hand, their scarcity of\nresources and their lack of sophisticated means of\ndetection and prevention make them more vulnerable\nto infiltration by terrorist organizations and to actions\nlaunched within their own borders. On the other hand,\nwhen they attempt to respond to demands from the\ninternational community, they are forced to mobilize\nresources that would otherwise be dedicated to their\neconomic and social development and to meeting the\nbasic needs of their peoples.\nAdded to this is the fact that, as was emphasized\nsome days ago by the Secretary-General, the poorer\neconomies are the ones that will pay most dearly for\nthe direct consequences of the terrorist attacks on the\nworld economy. My own country, which depends\nheavily on tourism revenues, is already feeling the\nrepercussions of the worldwide crisis in the\ntransportation and hospitality industries.\nThere is therefore a critical need for the\ninternational community to effectively help the\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\namong them, to bear the added burden that the battle\nagainst terrorism is placing on their economies. The\nindustrialized countries must display increased\nsolidarity and generosity in assisting developing\ncountries, since the effort that developing countries\nhave agreed to make and the sacrifices imposed on\n30\n\ntheir populations will also benefit the industrialized\nnations.\nA little more than a year ago, the Millennium\nSummit was held in this Hall. It drew approximately\n150 heads of State or Government. The dialogue was\nactive and innovative to an extent unprecedented in the\nhistory of the Organization. A tremendous variety of\nsectors of civil society participated directly. Not only\ndid the Summit provide a succinct overview of the\nactivities of the United Nations since its founding, it\nalso constituted a unique opportunity to present an\nintegrated picture of the strategic objectives for the\ntwenty-first century, thereby opening new avenues for\naddressing the challenges of globalization.\nThe conclusions of the Summit rekindled the\nflame of hope among the peoples of the world, in\nparticular among those who believe that it is possible\nto find effective ways of giving all countries real\nopportunities for development by improving their\ninstitutional and productive infrastructure and by\ncreating an international atmosphere conducive to\nproviding them with access to the means, both public\nand private, to fund their development. The drafting of\nthe road map towards the implementation of the United\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/56/326) gives the\ninternational community a powerful tool for joining\nforces in the implementation of the major policy lines\nadopted at the Summit.\nImportant events have taken place since the\nMillennium Summit. Of particular interest were the\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries, the special session of the\nGeneral Assembly on HIV/AIDS and the Durban\nWorld Conference Against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.\nNow, we are preparing to hold, in the near future, the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, a special Assembly session on children,\nand the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe specific manner in which those issues affect\nthe African continent, which is home to the great\nmajority of the least developed countries, has certainly\nhelped accelerate the decision-making processes with\nregard to regional integration, leading to important\nsteps that may open the way to a more promising\nfuture, despite the clouds hanging over the\ninternational scene.\nAs we know, a complicated combination of\nendogenous and exogenous phenomena has left the\nAfrican continent feeling increasingly marginalized.\nThe pace of economic growth has not been able to\nreduce poverty significantly. Diseases such as malaria\nand AIDS continue to cut lives short at a frightening\nrate. Several countries are the scene of instability;\nmany of them are engaged in armed conflicts and are\nexperiencing terrorist activities that kill thousands of\ninnocents, systematically destroy property, disrupt the\noperations of Governments and displace population\ngroups. The scanty positive results from the many\nplans and initiatives conceived and implemented to\ndeal with the serious problems Africa has faced over\nthe years have resulted in well known and widespread\ndissatisfaction, both in the international community\nand among African leaders.\nYet, despite the rather discouraging international\nclimate, Africa has taken important steps that may open\nthe way to a more promising future. With a view to\ncreating the instruments and mobilizing the will to face\nup to an increasingly complex global situation, African\nleaders proclaimed the African Union with a new\nvision for our continent. Moreover, they adopted the\nNew Initiative for Africa, recently designated as the\nNew Partnership for the Development of Africa, under\nwhich Africans assume full responsibility for\neradicating poverty and putting their countries on the\npath of economic growth and development at the same\ntime as they offer a partnership that is mutually\nbeneficial to the international community in meeting\nthe challenges of the new millennium.\nThe adoption of those two instruments and the\nfirm commitment to promote transparent stewardship\nwill surely open up new prospects for the establishment\nof peace, stability, democracy and development that\ncan lead the continent to occupy the prominent place in\nthe global economy that is justified by its immense\npotential.\nDoubtless, there is a long road to travel before we\nachieve political integration based on democratic\ninstitutions and grounded in popular participation,\ngood governance and action aimed at the promotion of\nsustainable development on the economic, social and\ncultural levels. But we believe that, with the emergence\nof new leadership dedicated to economic rebirth, with\nthe consolidation of democracy and good governance\nand with the anticipated support of the international\n31\n\ncommunity, conditions will be present for a\nfundamental and historic turnaround in Africa.\nTwo of the most critical problems faced by the\nOrganization and by the African continent, whose\nsolution cannot be postponed, now loom larger because\nof their interconnection and because of their bottleneck\neffect. I refer to poverty and armed conflicts. All\navailable data reinforce our apprehensions about the\nsuccess of the battle against poverty in the world. This\nmakes it necessary to adopt a strategy to win that war,\nsince attaining the objective of a 50 per cent reduction\nin the number of persons living in extreme poverty by\n2015 appears ever more problematic. Without measures\nthat can effectively reverse the process of socio-\neconomic degradation and, especially, without political\nwill on the part of the international community as a\nwhole, that goal of the Millennium Summit cannot be\nachieved.\nIt is an undisputed fact that, as a rule, conflicts\noccur in countries that are marked by poverty. This\ncause-and-effect relationship has become a vicious\ncircle that cannot be terminated without efficient\ncoordination between the preventive diplomacy and\nsocial action of the United Nations on the one hand and\nmore effective engagement by the industrialized\ncountries on the other.\nDespite the efforts of the international\ncommunity, the United Nations and the Secretary-\nGeneral towards peace and stabilization in international\nrelations and towards democracy and human rights,\ncertain regions of the world continue to be the scene of\narmed conflicts that threaten to spread and endanger\npeace and stability in those regions.\nThe terrorist acts of 11 September have added a\nnew measure of instability, provoking an anti-terrorist\nmilitary intervention in Afghanistan whose duration\nand consequences are difficult to assess.\nThe impasse in the search for a lasting solution to\nthe Palestine question, which is primarily a result of\nthe intransigence of Israel and the cycle of violence\nthat has been set in motion, has created one of the most\ndangerous focal points of tension and a threat to world\npeace. The implementation of the Oslo Agreement\nmust be resumed. Violence must be brought to an end\nand the internationally recognized rights of the\nPalestinians must be respected, including their right to\ntheir own State, while guaranteeing the Israeli people\nthe right to live in peace in their country within\ninternationally recognized borders.\nAfrica, today the scene of the greatest number of\narmed conflicts, has taken some positive steps in the\ndirection of peace, with the active involvement of the\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity,\nmany friendly countries and a number of multilateral\nactors, non-governmental organizations and elements\nof civil society. However the persistence of acts of\nviolence, namely the perpetration of criminal acts\nagainst civilian targets, bears evidence that the road to\npolitical and social stabilization leading in turn to the\nrestoration of peace is still long and difficult.\nIn Angola, for example, we have seen fresh\noutbreaks of armed action by UNITA, which continues\nto spread death and destruction. The Security Council\nonce again strongly condemned the actions of the rebel\nmovement, while maintaining its sanctions against that\norganization. But it is vital that all countries cooperate\nwithout reservation by denying UNITA the means to\ncarry out its criminal actions, so that it can be\npersuaded to lay down its weapons and fully abide by\nthe Lusaka Agreement.\nCape Verde is pleased at the success represented\nby the transition of East Timor towards independence,\na process that constitutes a remarkable and exemplary\nsuccess achieved by our Organization and particularly\nby the United Nations Transitional Administration in\nEast Timor. From the very outset and in the most\ndifficult moments, the Cape Verdean Government and\npeople have always been on the side of the people of\nEast Timor in their struggle for independence. We will\ncelebrate this occasion together on 20 May 2002, when\nEast Timor takes its destiny into its own hands and\njoins our great family here in the United Nations.\nI conclude by expressing the hope that the\noutcome of this session may make an effective\ncontribution to a better world, a more just and mutually\nsupportive world of peace and cooperation and,\nespecially, a world of tolerance and concord.\n\n\n"

I would like to\nassure him of our full cooperation in ensuring the\nsuccess of our work. With my personal\nknowledge of his abilities, experience and skills, I\nam fully confident that our efforts will be\ncrowned with success through the activation of\nthe Charter and the strengthening of its\ncontribution to the building of a better world.\n\u201cWe gather here under extremely sensitive\ncircumstances born from injustice and violence.\nWe must face them resolutely and boldly so as\nnot to allow the forces of evil to overcome our\naspirations, which cause us to gather here every\nyear. Among the circumstances which I would\nlike to highlight here today is, first, the continued\ndenial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople, including their right to the establishment\nof their independent State on the territories\noccupied since June 1967, including East\nJerusalem. The second circumstance I wish to\nmention is the harrowing events that took place in\nthe United States as a result of criminal terrorist\nacts that took a heavy toll in innocent lives.\nThirdly, peoples continue to suffer from violence,\npoverty, underdevelopment and injustice. We are\nduty-bound to stand united against these\nphenomena, because the oppression of one people\nis the oppression of all peoples, the killing of one\nsoul is the same as killing the entire world, a\nchild who goes to bed hungry spells hunger for\nthe whole world and the demolition of a single\nhome condemns the whole of humanity to sleep\nin the wilderness, deprived of the shelter of\nlegitimacy and law.\n\u201cThe events of 11 September in the United\nStates were not the beginning of terrorism. We\nhave been suffering from terrorism for many\nyears. We stood alone in combating it and\novercoming the obstacles placed by some,\ndeliberately or unwittingly, in the path of our\nstruggle, until it was vanquished. The tragic\nevents of 11 September have brought the whole\nquestion into the sharp focus of international\nconcern. This fact was reflected in a resolute\ninternational consensus to deal not only with the\nmanifestations of terrorism but also with its root\ncauses.\n\u201cThere is a consensus to address terrorism\nwithin the framework of international law, as\nrepresented by this great Organization, through\nthe use of a whole range of actions. These include\nlegislation, laws, security measures and the\ndissemination of enlightened thought. There must\nalso be a constant search for justice, truth and\ndevelopment. For the battle against terrorism to\nbe successful, it must extend to all aspects of life,\nincluding the political, economic, social, cultural\nand security aspects.\n\u201cA search for the root causes is not a\njustification, rather, a diagnosis. A disease cannot\nbe cured by dealing with the symptoms alone;\nthere must, rather, be a thorough analysis and a\nthorough investigation of the germs that spew\nvenom in human hearts, souls and bodies.\nDiscovering the pathogen opens the path for\neffective treatment.\n\u201cNo germ is more lethal to the future of\nhumanity than that of poverty. We look forward\nto the forthcoming United Nations International\nConference on Financing for Development to be\nheld in Mexico; we hope that it will result in a\nnew international consensus on an international\neconomic framework serving the interests of all\nStates, developed and developing alike. We also\nhope that it will create a new spirit of\nconstructive partnership among all members of\nthe international community. This partnership\nshould seek to eliminate the imbalances of\nglobalization, to maximize the opportunity for all\nto benefit from it and to achieve prosperity and\npolitical and economic stability.\n\u201cIn this context, I would like to highlight\nthe new initiative adopted by the African leaders\nat their recent summit in Lusaka to combat\npoverty and build a brighter future for the peoples\nof the continent \u2014 namely, the New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). This\ninitiative reflects a clear vision of the spirit of our\ntimes and a recognition by the peoples of Africa\n38\n\nof the reality that they bear the primary\nresponsibility for determining their future and for\neliminating the political, social and economic\nobstacles standing before them. We look forward\nto the international community providing the\nnecessary backing and support for this\nconstructive collective action in order to ensure a\nsuccessful outcome to the efforts aimed at the\ndevelopment, stability and prosperity in Africa.\n\u201cAt the same time, it is important to prevent\nthe spread of another disease: the so-called clash\nof civilizations and religions, which could\nundermine all of the progress made by humanity\nso far towards constructive interaction and\ncoexistence. Therefore, we call for the convening\nof an international conference to lay the\nfoundation for cooperation among all States\nagainst terrorism. The conference should define\nthe obligations of States, from which there can be\nno deviation. It should chart the path towards the\ncomplete elimination of this scourge. It is\nanathema to the right of all peoples to live in an\natmosphere of security, equality and justice that\nenables all to build the edifices of prosperity and\nprogress.\n\u201cWe also call for a genuine dialogue among\ncivilizations that would turn diversity into a\nconstructive force for mutual enrichment and\ndeep enlightenment. Such dialogue should allow\nus all to avoid surrendering to the forces of\nbarbarism, which wish to fabricate a clash or a\nconflict where there is none. There is but one\nsingle, unified march towards a better world.\nDifferences will not disappear in that better\nworld; what will disappear are the rejection,\nhumiliation and persecution of others on the\ngrounds of religion, race or gender.\n\u201cThat is the true sense of globalization that\nwe must uphold. It must be an expression of\ninterdependence among the peoples and countries\nof the world and of the exchange of human and\nsocial experience and economic and technological\npotential. Globalization means dealing with the\nchanging world in a spirit of understanding that\ndoes not attempt to impose or control \u2014 a spirit\nthat does not claim absolute distinction or attempt\nto impose hegemony under any pretext. With this\nspirit, an all-encompassing democracy will\nemerge in international life. All States, big and\nsmall, will make their contribution to global\nadvancement through their implementation of the\nprinciples adopted by the world after painful\nexperience of war and disasters.\n\u201cThis leads me to address a worrisome\nphenomenon that has grown stronger since the\ntragic events of 11 September: the attempt to\nassociate the charges of terrorism and\nbackwardness with Islam and the resultant\npersecution of Arabs and Muslims. This attempt\ncan spring only from ignorance and blind\nprejudice. Islam is a religion based on truth,\njustice and respect for human rights, particularly\nthe right to life and to be free from poverty,\nignorance and disease. In Islam, people have the\nduty to interact with others through fair means,\nunderstanding and mutual respect.\n\u201cI commend those Governments, including\nthe United States Government, that have taken\nmeasures to put an end to such heinous practices,\nwhich recall the dark ages. Nevertheless, we all\nneed to do much more to reveal the truth and to\ndispel the darkness of ignorance and arrogance.\nAll must know that human progress and\nknowledge are a river that has flowed ceaselessly\nsince the dawn of history. Every civilization has\nbeen both a beneficiary and a tributary of the\nachievements of other cultures. The Arab Islamic,\nChristian and pharaonic civilizations have all\nmade contributions that remain with us to this\nvery day. Without those contributions, the world\nwould not have been able to reach its current\nlevel of progress. Had it not been for those\ncontributions, the backward forces of darkness\nwould never have been reined in.\n\u201cI stand before this Assembly at the end of\nthe first year of the third millennium, fully 10\nyears after the Madrid Conference which\nreaffirmed the basis for a settlement in the Middle\nEast, and yet the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\nquestion of Palestine at its core still await a just\nand comprehensive settlement. That is truly hard\nto believe.\n\u201cIt is most regrettable that the Syrian and\nPalestinian territories occupied in 1967 and parts\nof the territory of Lebanon continue to languish\nunder the heavy yoke of Israeli occupation. That\noccupation continues to give rise to injustice,\n39\n\ndestruction, frustration and anger. Israel continues\nto refuse to comply with the terms of\ninternational legitimacy. It continues to defy the\nwill of the world. This unjust situation takes us\ndirectly back to the dark ages which the United\nNations was established to end, and creates\nsuffering and agony for a people whose only\ncrime is to demand their rights. It also creates an\nunhealthy climate exploited by those who wish to\nfish in troubled waters in order to propagate\ndarkness, misery, chaos and pain.\n\u201cThe international and regional situations,\nin addition to the humanitarian and legal\nrequirements and interests of all peoples, can no\nlonger tolerate the continued occupation,\nusurpation and settlement by Israel of the\nterritories of others. They can no longer brook an\narmy of hateful occupation using the most\nsophisticated and lethal weapons to brutalize\nunarmed civilians, demolish their homes and\nuproot their trees. All these actions are\nundertaken under a false pretext that disguises the\nfact that this army is only defending the\noccupation of the land of another people \u2014 the\npeople of Palestine.\n\u201cSimilarly, the international situation can no\nlonger bear the declaration by an occupying\nPower that it will not return the land it has seized\nand that, if it should return any, it will do so\nunder unfair conditions. Equally untenable is its\nposition that peace can only mean its hegemony\nand control in one form or another. The\nannouncement by a Government of its official\ndecision to resort to a policy of targeted killings\nis also unacceptable.\n\u201cLike all nations and peoples, Israel must\nunderstand that the world has changed. It must\nrealize that it is in its own interest to comply with\nthe international will. The only guarantee for the\nsecurity of Israel and of the whole region is for\nIsrael to put an end to its occupation, policies and\npractices and to coexist with the peoples of the\nregion on the basis of equality, understanding and\nrespect for international legality and the\nresolutions of the United Nations. Security cannot\nbe achieved with continued occupation. Peace is\nincompatible with the doctrines of hegemony and\nsuperiority. Free cooperation alone can ensure\nprosperity for all.\n\u201cSometimes I feel that, while the Arabs\nhave accepted Israel\u2019s existence among them,\nIsrael has not yet accepted the existence of a\nPalestinian people in the land of their ancestors,\nwith the right to live in a sovereign, independent\nState with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. No Arab,\nMuslim or Christian can abandon their holy sites\nin Jerusalem. Those sites are constantly\nthreatened by attempts to desecrate or destroy\nthem by Israeli extremists, with the support of\nthose ostensibly less extreme.\n\u201cA political settlement of the question of\nPalestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict,\nrequires the following.\n\u201cFirst, Israel must demonstrate its clear will\nto abandon its continued occupation of Arab\nlands as an alleged means to maintain its security.\nIsrael needs to understand that its position in the\nMiddle East will not improve in any real sense\nuntil it evinces the resolve to return to the borders\nof 4 June 1967.\n\u201cSecondly, Israel must realize that any\npeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine\nrequires the return of East Jerusalem to\nPalestinian sovereignty. Failure to understand this\nfact will always be an obstacle to all peaceful\nefforts to establish peace in the Middle East.\n\u201cThirdly, any political or security\narrangements for the settlement of the Palestinian\nquestion must lead to the establishment of a\nviable Palestinian State exercising sovereignty\nover its land, water and airspace. There must be a\njust settlement, based on United Nations\nresolutions and the norms of justice and\nlegitimacy, of the oldest refugee problem in\nmodern history, namely, that of Palestinian\nrefugees.\n\u201cFourthly, Egypt does not accept a situation\nin which Israel remains the sole nuclear Power in\nthe Middle East. The Middle East must be a zone\nfree from weapons of mass destruction. The\ncountries of the world, particularly the five\nnuclear-weapon States, must shoulder their\nresponsibilities under international nuclear non-\nproliferation instruments.\n\u201cWhen such conditions prevail and are\nsupported forcefully and decisively by the\n40\n\nworld\u2019s nations \u2014 including the friends of\nIsrael \u2014 because they are just and right, then the\npainful chapters of this long-lasting conflict can\nfinally be closed. Only then will it be possible to\nraise new generations living in peace and\ntolerance instead of living in the frustration,\nviolence and hatred that are born of illegal, unjust\noccupation.\n\u201cI cannot fail to refer to the central and\nimportant role of the United States of America in\nassisting the parties to reach a final and just\nsettlement. Egypt looks with satisfaction to the\nresumption of the active role of the United States.\nIn this regard, Egypt also welcomes the role of\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and\nthe indispensable role of the United Nations in\nthe establishment of a just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace in our region. Egypt will\ncontinue to play its role in support of the\nbrotherly Palestinian people and on the side of\njustice, right and legitimacy.\n\u201cOur part of the world, located in the area\nfrom West Asia to the southern shores of the\nMediterranean, requires peace in order to achieve\nthe objective of social, economic and political\ndevelopment. To that end, a just settlement must\nbe achieved quickly. Undoubtedly, the whole\ninternational community will support such a\nsettlement, which will also require the\npresentation of a major and integrated economic\nprogramme that would provide the economic\ncapabilities for unleashing the creative potential\nof the region, opening the door to constructive\ncooperation among all its peoples and nations,\nand helping it to overcome the tragedies it has\nlived through for more than a century.\n\u201cPerhaps time does not allow us to address\nall the problems facing the world. Suffice it for\nme to reaffirm that Egypt will always eagerly\ncontinue its efforts to uphold the noble principles\nthat the Charter of this great Organization\nenshrines in a manner that serves the purposes\nand principles of all peoples. We assure the\nAssembly that we will continue our effective\nparticipation and enhance our active contribution\nto any collective action that guarantees to the\nUnited Nations the capacities and tools it needs to\nenable it to undertake the great responsibilities\nwith which we the Member States have charged\nit, as well as to confront the multiple challenges\nimposed by the changing nature of our world.\u201d"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I first express my\ncondolences to the families and friends of those who\ndied in this morning's air crash. This was a tragedy in a\ncity that has already seen more than its share of tragedy\nin recent times.\nWe meet in New York at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly under the shadow of terrorist attacks\non this city just two months ago. We mourn the lives of\nnearly 5,000 people from 79 countries who, having\ndone nothing to deserve that fate, died in the attack.\nThe scale, premeditation, coordination and indifference\nto mass murder that characterize this attack represent a\nnew age of terrorism. It is a terrorism that appears to\nset no limit to its consequences. Those responsible for\nit foreshadow a willingness to use biological, chemical\nand nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The\npotentially catastrophic effects if they are able to carry\nout that threat demand an urgent and comprehensive\nresponse to pre-empt any such action.\nWe cannot allow the rule of terror to replace the\nrule of law. We cannot tolerate the damage that\nterrorism has already done to the global economy. We\ncannot allow terror to threaten basic human rights to\nlife and security.\nNew Zealand welcomes the lead by the United\nNations in coordinating an effective and enduring\nresponse to terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), adopted unanimously, sets out a blueprint for\naction which every Member State has an obligation to\nimplement. Its emphasis is on measures to close off\nfinancial support and the provision of refuge for\nterrorist groups in every country of the world.\nInternational cooperation in imposing these measures\nand bringing the terrorists to justice will, in the longer\nterm, lie at the heart of the campaign to defeat\nterrorism.\nRemoving the immediate threat posed by\nterrorists such as those in Al Qaeda and those who\nharbour them will, however, require more than\nresolutions. Time and again over the past three years,\nthe Security Council has called on the Taliban to\nprevent the use of Afghanistan by terrorists to launch\nstrikes against other countries. Those resolutions and\nthe sanctions that accompanied them have been ignored\nby the Taliban. Where groups operate beyond the rule\nof law and countries put themselves outside of\ninternational codes of behaviour, the use of force\nbecomes a necessary part of our response.\nMultilateral action and cooperation on a wider\nfront are also necessary if we are to be successful in\nremoving the threat of terrorism on an ongoing and\nlasting basis. Comprehensive action is needed to\nminimize the threat of chemical, biological or nuclear\nweapons falling into the hands of extremist groups. No\nState should develop, test and hold weapons of this\nnature. Such weapons are a threat to humanity. Their\nuse by States would destroy and otherwise harm\ninnocent human beings as certainly as did the actions\nof the terrorist group that attacked New York.\nNations yet to sign and ratify the United Nations\nConventions on Chemical and Biological Weapons and\ntreaties to ban mines and inhumane weapons must do\nso. Nations must equally commit themselves to the\nelimination of nuclear weapons, the early entry into\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nand an immediate start to negotiations on a fissile\nmaterial cut-off treaty.\nThe attack of 11 September should also\nencourage all nations to ratify the Rome Statute to\nbring into effect the International Criminal Court as a\nforum for pursuing action against those responsible for\ncrimes against humanity.\nSuppression of terrorism must also involve action\nto deal with its causes. States must consider whether\nthe suppression of dissident or minority groups rather\nthan allowing legitimate channels to voice dissent\nleaves resort to force as the only option.\nThe events of 11 September should encourage all\ncountries and organizations, particularly those directly\ninvolved, to renew efforts to find a just and peaceful\nsolution to the Middle East crisis. To achieve a\npeaceful solution between Palestinians and Israelis\nrequires good will and flexibility on both sides. There\ncan be no double standards in how the principles of\n15\n\nhuman rights, freedom and social and economic\nopportunity are applied to all peoples.\nOne consequence of the campaign against\nterrorism has been to bring the world's attention to the\nsituation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan reminds us that\nwhere a vacuum is created by the absence of legitimate\ngovernment and the rule of law, it will be filled by\nextremist elements, criminal groups dealing in drug\ntrafficking and terrorist organizations, all of which can\noperate with impunity.\nThe international community has for too long\nbeen indifferent to the situation in Afghanistan and to\nthe long-standing refugee crisis that has resulted from\n22 years of war, from famine and from Taliban\noppression. Pakistan and Iran have carried the burden\nof 3.6 million refugees, while much of the world\nshowed concern only when a handful of those refugees\nin desperation sought to enter other countries illegally.\nToo little concern has been shown internationally to the\n300,000 Afghan children who have died annually from\npreventable causes. One in three children in refugee\ncamps die before they reach the age of five. The groups\nnow protesting against military intervention were silent\nwhile this human catastrophe was unfolding over the\nlast few years.\nAny loss of innocent life in conflict is tragic, and\nextraordinary measures must be taken to avoid it. But a\nfailure to remove the Taliban regime and a failure to\nassist the Afghan people to put in place a broad-based,\nmoderate and stable Government to replace the Taliban\nwill mean the ongoing loss of hundreds of thousands of\nlives and the continued suffering of the Afghan people.\nRenewed efforts are needed through United\nNations agencies to provide emergency relief to people\nwithin Afghanistan and in the refugee camps to avoid\nunnecessary loss of life through the winter and in the\nmonths to come. The United Nations must stand ready\nto assist Afghanistan to rebuild itself once the conflict\nis over, working with as broad a coalition of Afghan\ngroups as is possible to create a viable political,\neconomic and social infrastructure.\nResolving the problems that have forced so many\nmillions of people from their homes is fundamental to\nsolving the growing refugee crisis. In Afghanistan and\nelsewhere, people flee their homelands through fear of\ndeath or persecution, or because of poverty and lack of\nopportunity.\nIn a world made smaller by advances in\ncommunication and transport, no State can ignore the\nplight in other countries or expect not to face\nconsequences from unacceptable discrepancies in\nwealth, opportunity and human rights standards.\nSuppression of criminal organizations responsible\nfor people trafficking is a challenge which demands\nincreased international cooperation. Those who profit\nfrom people's desperation and who, once paid, are\ncareless as to whether or not their human cargo\nsurvives must be stamped out. However, removing the\ncauses of people fleeing from their countries remains\nfundamental.\nNew Zealand's own region of the Pacific has not\nbeen immune from violence and instability. In recent\nyears, we have seen conflict in East Timor, violence\nbetween Government and separatist movements within\nIndonesia and in Bougainville, ethnic conflict in the\nSolomon Islands and a coup that overthrew a legitimate\nGovernment in Fiji.\nProblems remain in the region, but there have\nbeen notable areas of improvement. A peace settlement\nhas been signed in Bougainville. Fiji has held\ndemocratic elections. Indonesia is seeking to resolve\nseparatist conflict by offering greater autonomy. In\nEast Timor, there have been free elections, and that\ncountry will gain independence as the first new nation\nof the twenty-first century in May 2002. International\ncooperation and a capable transitional administration\nby the United Nations have achieved a remarkable\ntransformation in a poor and devastated country. I\ncongratulate the Security Council on its endorsement of\nthe Secretary-General's concept for a post-\nindependence United Nations presence in East Timor to\nconsolidate what has been achieved.\nIn acknowledging the role of United Nations\npersonnel, I would also stress the need to ensure their\nproper protection in situations which are often\ndangerous. The murder of United Nations relief\nworkers in Atambua, West Timor, and the failure to\nbring to account those fully responsible are a reminder\nthat more must be done to protect our United Nations\npersonnel. We endorse the Secretary-General's\nrecommendations on extending the legal protection for\nUnited Nations and other personnel involved in\nhumanitarian operations.\nIt is timely at this General Assembly to stress the\nimportance of the role of the United Nations. The\n16\n\ncritical wars of the twenty-first century will not be won\nby single nations, however powerful, or even by\ncoalitions. It is the United Nations acting collectively\nwhich will win the wars against terrorism, poverty and\ndisease; threats to the environment; and the threats\nposed by conflict and weapons of mass destruction.\nThe commitments made by heads of State and\nGovernment in the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration last year take on even greater relevance\nfollowing the events of 11 September.\nHowever, for the United Nations to achieve its\npotential, it must undergo reform. To prevent the\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat from becoming\noverwhelmed by so many tasks that they fail to be\neffective in tackling any of them, we need to prioritize\nour agenda and to be more selective.\nThe Security Council needs reform. Its\nmembership should be expanded to reflect\ncontemporary realities, but without maintaining or\nextending the veto. Countries contributing to\npeacekeeping operations should be afforded greater\ninvolvement in the Council's decision-making with\nrespect to those operations. Peacekeeping operations\nmust be sufficiently resourced.\nThe capacity of the United Nations for rapid\nreaction must be strengthened. New Zealand is ready to\nenter into discussions on a memorandum of\nunderstanding with the United Nations on its\nparticipation in the standby arrangements system. This\nis consistent with New Zealand's long-standing\nreadiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations and\nits current involvement in more than 12 such\noperations, including its commitment since 1999 of a\nbattalion to help ensure the success of the United\nNations operation in East Timor.\nThe United Nations was founded after the Second\nWorld War to build a world free from poverty, violence\nand the violation of human rights. Nations committed\nthemselves to a collective response to problems that\ncould not be solved by countries individually.\nCountries agreed on rules of international behaviour.\nNo one would claim that the United Nations has\nan unblemished record of success. But without it, the\nworld would be a much less secure place, much less\nable to confront the difficulties which we face. Let this\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly reaffirm\nour commitment to work collectively to defeat\nterrorism, conflict, poverty and disease, and set the\nagenda for peace, development and respect for human\nrights for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on\nyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\nthe General Assembly, which is meeting under critical\nand exceptional circumstances. We wish you every\nsuccess in your arduous endeavours. I also wish to\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. In addition,\non this occasion, I would like to pay tribute to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the efforts he has\nmade throughout the year. We hope that he will be able\nto enhance the prospects for peace, stability, and\ndevelopment in the world during his second term of\noffice.\nThe whole world was shocked by the enormity of\nthe tragedy that struck the United States of America on\n11 September \u2014 the barbaric terrorist acts against New\nYork City and Washington, D.C. These acts exacted a\nhigh toll among innocent civilians and plunged the\npeoples and countries of the world into an atmosphere\nof gloom and anxiety. We once again extend our\ncondolences to the families who lost their loved ones;\nsome of them were Lebanese, or American of Lebanese\ndescent. We share their deep sense of grief and sorrow.\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to reiterate\nLebanon\u2019s condemnation of these terrorist attacks.\nLebanon stands ready to cooperate seriously, positively\nand responsibly with the United States and the United\nNations in the fight against terrorism, in accordance\nwith the rules of international law and with the\nprerogatives of national sovereignty.\nFor a long time, Lebanon has suffered from\nIsraeli occupation and Israel\u2019s terrorist practices. We\nresisted this occupation until it ultimately ended with\nIsrael\u2019s withdrawal from most of our national\nterritories. It is perfectly normal in this context to\nstress the need for distinguishing between terrorism,\nwhich we strongly condemn, and peoples\u2019 legitimate\nright to struggle for the liberation of their territories\nfrom foreign occupation on the basis of the United\nNations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. As\nregards Lebanon, we have to refer to the April\nUnderstanding of 1996, an agreement which was\nreached under the auspices of the United States and\nFrance after Israel had carried out the Qana Massacre\nthat same year, in addition to the Taif Agreement that\nhad laid down the tenets of our national reconciliation.\nA series of Security Council presidential statements\nhave given the Council\u2019s blessing to the Agreement.\nBoth the Taif Agreement and the April Understanding\nrecognized the legitimacy of resistance against the\nIsraeli occupation.\nLet me recall here that had Israel not invaded\nLebanon on 14 March 1978, there would have been no\nLebanese Resistance \u2014 which, of course, is the subject\nof our pride \u2014 to counter this invasion.\nHad Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\nadopted on 19 March been implemented without delay,\nas stipulated in its provisions, the Resistance would not\nhave been born.\nHad it not been for widening the scope of the\nIsraeli invasion of Lebanese territory and the\nsubsequent occupation of Beirut in 1982, the\nResistance would not have escalated.\nHad it not been for Israel\u2019s persistence in\noccupying what it called \u201cthe security zone\u201d, no one\nwould have had to resist it and ultimately force it to\n14\n\nwithdraw in May 2000 from most of the territories that\nit had occupied.\nHad Israel not occupied the Palestinian territories,\nthere would have been no need for a courageous\nuprising against occupation.\nIt must be pointed out that Lebanon is determined\nto fight terrorism. We have acceded to 10 out of the 12\nconventions relevant to the question of international\nterrorism. We stand ready to respond positively to any\ninternational initiative, including the convening of an\ninternational conference for this purpose, to arrive at a\nstandard definition of terrorism. It would be wise not to\nlink terrorism to a particular race or religion,\nparticularly to Arabs and Muslims, if we want to avoid\nsetting world civilizations and religions on a collision\ncourse. We can thus avoid falling into the trap designed\nby those who are pushing the world towards collision,\nconflict and strife.\nSide by side with its Arab brothers, Lebanon is\ndetermined to exert additional efforts to combat\nterrorism and eradicate its various root causes. In 1998,\nArab States successfully negotiated and concluded the\nArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, a\nConvention with clear-cut purposes and objectives.\nThe events of 11 September have demonstrated\nthat humanity has not yet reached its ultimate\nevolutionary stage. They also prove that unbridled\nglobal rejectionist movements and terrorist groups that\nknow no boundaries and accept no restrictions are\ncapable of undermining our confidence in everything\nwe have achieved so far. They are working to establish\nwhat can be referred to as a \u201cnew world disorder\u201d and\nglobal instability.\nUnder the circumstances, and given prevailing\nfears, a thorough look at what is happening in the\nMiddle East conflict zone would clearly reveal the\ndifficulty of realizing the objectives of peace and\ndevelopment promoted by the United Nations. In recent\nmonths, the world has witnessed continued Israeli\noccupation of Palestinian territories, unjust and\narbitrary Israeli practices, desecration of holy sites,\nblockades, killings, assassinations and displacements.\nSuch acts continue with no international deterrence or\ncontrol.\nIntransigent Israeli policies, deviation from the\nMadrid principles and terms of reference, and stripping\nthe peace process of its political content in favour of\nso-called Israeli security considerations indicate that\nprojected solutions to the Middle East crisis are\ndivided among many conflicting rationales. There is\nthe rationale of a partial solution and that of a\ncomprehensive solution; the rationale of basing a\nsolution on force and that of basing it on what is right,\njust and grounded in United Nations resolutions; the\nrationale of achieving security at the expense of peace\nand that of making peace the foundation of security.\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, attention has\nfocused on the need to step up the effort to find a\npolitical solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, a solution\nthat should allow the Palestinian people to establish an\nindependent Palestinian State on their national soil. It\nis our duty to recall that a just and comprehensive\npeace necessitates that we simultaneously address all\naspects of the Middle East conflict. The Lebanese and\nSyrian tracks must not be separated from the track of\nthe overall settlement. That track is stalled, and\nreviving it will require the devotion of additional\nefforts. The liberation of Lebanese territories from\nIsraeli occupation must be completed. Israel must\nwithdraw from the entire occupied Syrian Golan\nHeights to the line of 4 June 1967. The question of\nPalestinian refugees, their legitimate right to return,\nand Lebanon\u2019s right to oppose their resettlement on its\nterritories must not be ignored. This opposition is\ngrounded in the principles of fairness, justice and\nsovereignty.\nIn the light of the above, we believe that a\ncomprehensive peace built on justice and on the\nresolutions conferring international legitimacy is the\nsole guarantee of the sustainability of any desirable\nsolution.\nThere are two fundamental questions in Lebanon\nthat are of direct concern to the United Nations: one is\nthe mandate of the international forces in southern\nLebanon and the other is the destiny of Palestinian\nrefugees in Lebanon.\nIn paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution\n1365 (2001), which was adopted on 31 July, the\nSecurity Council requested the Secretary-General to\nsubmit a comprehensive report on the activities of the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),\ntaking into account its possible reconfiguration into an\nobserver mission in the light of the developments on\nthe ground, following appropriate consultations with\nthe Government of Lebanon.\n15\n\nDue to the gravity of the situation, and in\nanticipation of the Secretary-General\u2019s report, it is\nimportant for me to stress from this rostrum that both\nlogic and the realities on the ground call for\nmaintaining Unifier\u2019s existing mandate without\namending it or reconfiguring the mission into an\nobserver force. On the contrary, we believe that\nUNIFIL\u2019s role must be strengthened, particularly as it\nhas not yet fulfilled the entire mandate entrusted to it\nby the international community in Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978), which was adopted on 19 March\n1978. That mandate cannot be implemented by an\nobserver force due to the following questions that are\nstill pending.\nThe first pending question is the verification of\nthe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. It\nis a known fact that the United Nations did not verify\nthe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. It\nonly verified the withdrawal of Israeli forces to a de\nfacto withdrawal line, which became known as the blue\nline. That line is not in conformity with Lebanon\u2019s\ninternationally recognized borders, a fact recognized in\nsubsequent reports of the Secretary-General.\nTherefore, the Shab\u2019a farms, on the slopes of\nMount Hermon, remained under Israeli occupation,\ntogether with three additional points along the line of\nwithdrawal drawn by the United Nations. At the time,\nLebanon expressed its reservations on these points.\nThese territories are Lebanese lands and Lebanon\nreserves its natural right to restore them and to extend\nits sovereignty to them. Lebanon would like to stress\nhere that it will stand up for every inch of its national\nsoil and for all its rights to its water resources, in\naccordance with international law. In that regard, we\nmust draw attention to the fact that Israel continues to\nviolate Lebanese sovereignty on a daily basis. In his\nreport issued in July of this year, the Secretary-General\ndescribed these violations as provocative. Furthermore,\nIsrael continues to increase the frequency of its threats\nagainst Lebanon and Syria.\nThe second pending question concerns the\nrestoration of international peace and security. In his\nreports to the Security Council between May 2000 and\nJuly 2001, the Secretary-General recognized that\nUNIFIL had not fully implemented the task entrusted\nto it. He repeatedly said that there is a third task the\ninternational forces have yet to undertake, and on\nwhich UNIFIL will have to concentrate. That task is\nthe restoration of international peace and security in\nthe region. How can we speak of a third task yet to be\ncompleted by UNIFIL under Security Council\nresolution 425 (1978) and at the same time discuss the\npossibility of reconfiguring UNIFIL into an observer\nmission?\nIn that respect, we are duty-bound to recall that\nthe security of the region is indivisible. We would be\ndeceiving ourselves if we were to believe that peace\nand security can be restored to the region outside the\ncontext of a comprehensive overall solution to all\naspects of the conflict on all its tracks. Such an\nundertaking requires an all-inclusive effort, not only by\nUNIFIL but also by the entire United Nations, which\nshould be responsible for the enforcement of its\nresolutions, particularly resolution 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 425 (1978).\nFrom this rostrum, I call on the United Nations\nSecretariat and the Security Council to preserve\nUNIFIL\u2019s existing mandate. The timing is of particular\nimportance, given the serious circumstances prevailing\nin our region and in the world. We must also recall that\nin May of this year the Security Council adopted a\nstatement in which members acknowledged Lebanon\u2019s\nconcerns and apprehensions, including those relating to\nthe future.\nLebanon is tirelessly seeking to achieve a total\nIsraeli withdrawal from its territories. At the same\ntime, it attaches great importance to the release of the\nLebanese people kidnapped by Israel during its\noccupation of our land and thereafter detained in Israeli\njails. They remain incarcerated in Israeli prisons as\nhostages, in contravention of international laws and\ninstruments, particularly the Geneva Convention of\n1949 and the subsequent Protocols thereto.\nThe 130,000 landmines that were left behind by\nthe Israeli occupation are still killing, maiming and\nharming scores of civilians in Lebanon. They curtail\ntheir freedom of movement and obstruct their work. We\nconsider this to be a continued \u2014 albeit indirect \u2014\nform of occupation of Lebanese territories by Israel. In\nthe light of this situation, the United Nations and the\ninternational community should make a greater effort\nto compel Israel to hand over all maps and records\ndisclosing the locations of the mines, which have to be\ncleared as soon a possible.\nHowever, with respect to the hundreds of\nthousands of Palestinian refugees who have been\nprovisionally hosted on Lebanese land ever since their\n16\n\nexpulsion from their homes in Palestine \u2014 and for\nwhose final status the United Nations bears essential\nresponsibility \u2014 we reiterate our demand for a just\nsolution to their cause, on the basis of the\nimplementation of their right to return and of our\nrefusal to resettle them in Lebanon.\nIn this regard, it behoves us to remember that the\nresettlement of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon\nwould constitute a time bomb that would jeopardize the\npeace, security and stability in the Middle East; such\nrefugees will relentlessly seek to return to their\nhomeland and Lebanon is unable to integrate them,\ngiven the precariousness of its own internal\nequilibrium and the fact that provisions of its national\npact do not allow for any form of resettlement.\nFurthermore, Lebanon appeals for greater\ninternational attention to enable us to provide urgently\nneeded assistance that could help return our liberated\nlands to normalcy, restore economic balance and\nprovide opportunities for growth after long years of\noccupation and destruction.\nThis is an era of responsibility and accountability\nfor the world, but accountability cannot be selective,\nnor can it be based on double standards. During the\nlong years of occupation of the Lebanese territories,\nIsraeli bombardment and the destruction that ensued\nkilled thousands and injured and disabled thousands\nmore. Our infrastructure, vital facilities, houses,\nschools, farms and bridges were destroyed and our\ngrowth and development were hindered. Lebanon must\ntherefore be adequately compensated. Lebanon will\nspare no effort in appealing to the relevant international\npolitical and judicial organs to request that Israel make\nreparations for the damage resulting from its acts of\naggression.\nIt may be useful to recall here that Israel did not\nwithdraw from most of the Lebanese territories of its\nown accord; neither did it withdraw in compliance with\nthe decision of an international authority or in response\nto a political requirement that remained on the table for\nover 22 years. Rather, it withdrew under pressure from\nthe Lebanese resistance, which was embraced by the\nLebanese State. It withdrew because of the\nsteadfastness of the Lebanese people. Its withdrawal\nwas not a voluntary d\u00e9marche for peace, as some\nwould have it. The withdrawal was a measure taken to\navoid peace, and instead to seek alleged security at the\nexpense of the requirements of a just and\ncomprehensive peace.\nLebanon is a democratic Arab country, open to\nthe world, with a civilization that goes back thousands\nof years. Thanks to our diverse social composition, our\nexperience is informed by coexistence and consensus.\nIt is a unique experience, rarely paralleled in our world\ntoday. We call on the Assembly to mobilize the forces\nof peace and justice in order to redress the historical\ninjustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people. The\nAssembly must bring about a just and comprehensive\nsolution to one of the most complex and dangerous\nregional conflicts in the Middle East. It is a conflict\nthat has depleted the resources of its people, hindered\nits progress and stunted its contributions to the world.\nThis solution will unfetter its creative capabilities and\nenable it to develop a global partnership free from fear,\ninjustice and terror.\nMy country is proud to be hosting the next Arab\nSummit, to be convened in Beirut in March next year.\nPreparations are already under way to receive the Arab\nmonarchs and presidents. We will also be hosting the\nNinth Summit of the International Organization of la\nFrancophonie in the fall of 2002, under the heading,\n\u201cDialogue among cultures\u201d. Lebanon is a founding\nmember of the League of Arab States, the United\nNations and the International Organization of la\nFrancophonie. Lebanon, which participated in drafting\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is capable\nof proving that it can reassert its active presence and\nagain take a pioneering role at the regional and\ninternational levels. We come from a time-honoured\ncivilization, and are blessed by unique and\ndistinguished experience of coexistence. We will put\nthis to the service of the noble objectives of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOsmonakun IbraimovI\nwould like at the outset to join in all the\ncongratulations that have been extended to the\nPresident on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly. I would like to assure\nhim that our delegation is ready to cooperate fully with\nhim and also to wish him, on behalf of the Kyrgyz\ndelegation, success in carrying out his duties.\nOur delegation would also like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election to a second term of\noffice and also on his winning the Nobel Peace Prize,\ntogether with the United Nations, this year. We\nconsider that this award was well deserved.\nThe work of this session is taking place at an\nextremely complex time for the international\ncommunity. Today, from this lofty rostrum, on behalf\nof the people of Kyrgyzstan, I convey our deepest\ncondolences to the people and the Government of the\nUnited States in connection with the tragic events of 11\nSeptember this year, which claimed many victims.\nTerrorism has laid down an extremely dangerous\nchallenge to all of civilized humanity, democracy and\nfreedom. In this context, the efforts of the international\ncommunity aimed at combating terrorism, first and\nforemost within the framework of the United Nations,\nare fully supported by Kyrgyzstan, and our\nGovernment is taking all necessary measures to\nimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\nand 1373 (2001). From the very outset, we have\nsupported and will continue to support the activities of\nthe United States and other countries within the anti-\nterrorist coalition, and consider the military operations\nto be inevitable and justified actions.\nOur position of principle with respect to terrorism\nstems from Kyrgyzstan\u2019s position at the epicentre of\nthe struggle against international terrorism and against\nthe illegal trafficking in drugs and weapons, which are\na threat to the stability and security not only of the\nCentral Asian region but of the entire civilized world.\nOur country has for three years been defending itself\nagainst incursions by terrorist bands that have resulted\nin the deaths of entirely innocent people. If it had not\nbeen for our firm determination to take a stand against\nterrorism and keep a firm lock on our borders, then\nserious destabilization of the entire region would have\nbeen inevitable. We do not wish to exaggerate our role,\nbut it is we who have prevented the terrorists from\n5\n\ncrossing our borders into other countries. I would also\nlike to note that Kyrgyzstan has also made its territory\navailable and the necessary transport vehicles for the\ntransit of international humanitarian assistance to\nAfghanistan on the Osh-Ishkashim-Faizabad road.\nA serious problem for us is that of refugees who\nhave come to the territory of our Republic from the\nregion of the conflict. Kyrgyzstan already hosts\napproximately 2,000 Afghan refugees. Their numbers\ncould increase very rapidly. All of this is a very serious\nproblem, and finding a solution will require active\nassistance from the relevant international\norganizations.\nOver the last few years we have all seen\nAfghanistan become a sanctuary for various\ninternational terrorist organizations. After the fall of\nKabul yesterday, the inter-Afghan conflict has entered\na completely new phase. Moreover, it is now more\nurgent than ever to deal with the question of a mutually\nacceptable solution to untie the Afghan knot.\nKyrgyzstan proceeds from a deep understanding of the\nneed for rapidly winding up the military confrontation\nin Afghanistan, with the subsequent formation in that\nlong-suffering country of a broadly representative,\nmulti-ethnic Government, that, first and foremost,\nmeets the interests and aspirations of the Afghan\npeople.\nIn this connection, Kyrgyzstan welcomes\nconstructive ideas and proposals aimed at establishing\na long-awaited peace in Afghanistan. For our part, we\nconsistently express our readiness to cooperate with all\nthe countries involved in order to settle the Afghan\nconflict. We consider that it is precisely the United\nNations, with its experience, capabilities and\ninstitutional potential, that should play a key role in\nbringing together the efforts of the international\ncommunity to combat terrorism. In this regard,\nKyrgyzstan proposes the creation of a special\ncommittee of the United Nations to restore peace and\nstability in Afghanistan, which could be a coordinating\nbody for all the practical measures to this end.\nToday we would like to recall one of the well-\nknown initiatives of the President of Kyrgyzstan, Askar\nAkayev, to hold a forum for dialogue on security\nquestions between the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference. It seems to us that there is now\nan urgent need for such a dialogue between these two\nauthoritative organizations. In this connection,\nKyrgyzstan took the very important initiative to hold\non 13-14 December of this year, under the aegis of the\nOSCE in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, an\ninternational conference on enhancing security and\nstability in Central Asia and strengthening\ncomprehensive efforts to counter terrorism. We are\nnow making active preparations, together with the\nsecretariat of the OSCE, for this important measure. In\nour view, the participation of the United Nations in that\nevent would facilitate a consolidated solution for\nworking out joint approaches to combating terrorism.\nThis would be an important step in strengthening the\ninternational community\u2019s capacity to avert the threat\nto security in Central Asia, including by expanding the\nassistance to countries in that region in the face of the\ngrowing threat. It is encouraging to note that many\nStates, including participants in the anti-terrorist\ncoalition, are showing serious interest in the Bishkek\ninternational conference to combat terrorism.\nKyrgyzstan attaches great importance to\nquestions of sustainable development. In this regard,\nmy delegation greatly appreciates the decision of the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly to hold a\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. It is a pleasure to note that\nKyrgyzstan made a very significant contribution to the\npreparation of the Rio + 10 summit on problems of\nsustainable development, having organized, together\nwith the United Nations Secretariat, in Bishkek, a\nregional round table. The results of the round table will\ncertainly be reflected in the key documents of the\nWorld Summit in Johannesburg.\nAs we well know, the United Nations has\nproclaimed next year the International Year of\nMountains. This is certainly a very important and\nproductive initiative on a global level. We, the\nmembers of the delegation of Kyrgyz Republic, can\nindeed be proud that one of the most important\ninitiatives of the International Year of Mountains was\ntaken by our President, Askar Akayev.\nIt is indeed true that the mountains of the world\nare a symbol of the lofty ideals of humankind, but\nmountains also pose related ecological, economic and\nsocial problems for the people living in those areas.\nHigh mountains should not cause these problems for\ntheir inhabitants. I fully agree fully with Mrs. Benita\nFerrero-Waldner, the Foreign Minister of Austria, that\nthe International Year of Mountains should be a year\n6\n\nfor new initiatives for exchanging experience and\ndrafting new programmes of cooperation.\nThe acuity of the ecological problems of\nmountainous areas and their connection to economic\nproblems led our specialists to examine international\nexperience in order to see how to restructure our debts\nby seeking debt-relief in exchange for ecological\ninitiatives. We feel that this approach provides a unique\nopportunity for financing national ecological and\nenvironmental projects and economic investment\nprogrammes. We should also like to express the hope\nthat at the upcoming International Conference on\nFinancing for Development in Mexico, sufficient\nattention will be given to the specific problems of\nmountainous countries.\nWe wish to take this opportunity to welcome the\ndecision of Member States to hold an official opening\nceremony for the International Year of Mountains in\nNew York in December of next year. We also note with\ngreat satisfaction that in October 2002, the capital of\nKyrgyzstan, Bishkek, will welcome representatives\nfrom all over the world for the Bishkek Global\nMountain Summit. We are already preparing for this\nvery important event, which will take place during the\nInternational Year of Mountains. We wish to express\nour hope that the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, will be able participate in the\nSummit.\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our deep\nconviction that the efforts of United Nations Member\nStates and the entire world community are aimed at\nimplementing the ideals and principles enshrined in the\nMillennium Declaration and the United Nations\nCharter, and that they will lead to the triumph of peace,\nfreedom and democracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation\nextends to you, Sir, its warmest congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of this body at its fifty-sixth\nsession. Given your impressive credentials, we are\nconfident that under your guidance we will conclude\nour deliberations successfully. I would like to take this\nopportunity to express our appreciation to His\nExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who\n17\n\nadmirably conducted the affairs of the epoch-making\nMillennium Assembly last year.\nLet me also warmly congratulate our\nindefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on\nhis reappointment to a second term of office and on his\naward, with the United Nations, of the 2001 Nobel\nPrize for Peace. As citizens of the West African\nsubregion, we in Sierra Leone are proud of his\nstewardship. Sierra Leone is indeed indebted to him,\nthe staff of the Secretariat and the United Nations\nfamily for their invaluable support of our effort to\nsecure peace and stability in my country.\nForty years ago, on 29 September to be exact,\nSierra Leone was admitted as the one hundredth\nMember of the United Nations. During the period that\nfollowed, we made our own modest contribution to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\nhave faithfully adhered to the purposes and principles\nof the Charter. We have practised, and continue to\npractise, tolerance and good-neighbourliness. Our faith\nin the Organization remains as strong as it was 40 years\nago.\nAt the same time, the United Nations and its\nagencies have done a lot for the people of Sierra\nLeone. As President Kabbah told the Millennium\nSummit last year, in the course of its membership,\nSierra Leone has tested the capacity of the United\nNations to respond to major challenges, especially in\nthe areas of peacekeeping, through the United Nations\nMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and of\nhumanitarian law, through the proposed special court to\ntry those who bear the greatest responsibility for\nserious violations of Sierra Leonean law, war crimes\nand crimes against humanity committed in Sierra\nLeone. In conveying our sincere thanks to the\nOrganization and the rest of the international\ncommunity for their support, my delegation expresses\nthe hope that Sierra Leone and the United Nations will\ncontinue to work closely for peace, security and\nsustainable development in the coming years.\nSadly, this session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place in the aftermath of the despicable acts of\nterrorism inflicted on our host country on 11 September\n2001 \u2014 acts that claimed the lives of thousands of\nAmericans and of the nationals of 86 other countries.\nAs we share their grief and renew our heartfelt\ncondolences to the families of the victims and the\nGovernment of the United States, we Sierra Leoneans\nare reminded of that ominous day in January 1999\nwhen over 5,000 innocent civilians were brutally killed\nduring the rebel onslaught on our capital city. Hundreds\nof others, including children and young girls, were\nabducted or raped or had limbs deliberately amputated.\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations is\ndeplorable and must be eradicated. My delegation\nwould like to assure this Assembly that we shall do\neverything within our power and available resources to\nsupport the current multilateral counter-terrorism effort\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\nThe new emerging coalition to counteract the\nscourge of terrorism is absolutely necessary. However,\nthe Sierra Leone delegation strongly believes that we\nshould also strengthen existing coalitions or build new\nones against those forces that continue to kill millions\nof children and adults throughout the world every\nsingle day. We know these forces. We know their\nvicious and destructive powers. Hunger, poverty,\nmalnutrition, malaria, HIV/AIDS, brutality and\nintolerance \u2014 these are but a few of them.\nSierra Leone calls upon this Assembly and the\nentire international community to use the current\ninternational solidarity against terrorism to translate the\nAgenda for Peace, the Agenda for Development, the\nMillennium Declaration, the Declaration and Plan of\nAction of the World Summit for Children and similar\nstrategies and goals into a series of new coalitions: a\nnew coalition against childhood diseases; a new\ncoalition against poverty and human\nunderdevelopment; a new coalition against the scourge\nof HIV/AIDS and malaria; and a brand new coalition\nagainst the accumulation of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThere has been a marked improvement in the\nsituation in Sierra Leone. The serious humanitarian\ncrisis still prevails, but is gradually subsiding.\nThousands of ex-combatants have been disarmed and\ndemobilized. Government authority and civil\nadministrative services are gradually being established\nin areas previously occupied by rebels. Our\nrestructured army is now truly professional, thanks to\nthe intensive training programme directed by the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom.\nBy all accounts, we can say that the overall\nsecurity and safety situation is one of great expectation.\nIn the coming months, the people of Sierra Leone will\nonce again start to enjoy to the fullest extent their basic\n18\n\nright to life \u2014 a life free from brutal armed rebellion\nsuch as that provoked and abetted by external forces\nand fuelled by blood diamonds for 10 long years. In\nthis connection, my delegation would like to express\nour sincere gratitude to the United Nations and its\nagencies, the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), UNAMSIL troop-contributing\ncountries, the United Kingdom and other friendly\nnations for their individual and collective contributions\nto the peace process in Sierra Leone.\nAllow me from this rostrum to express the\ncondolences of the Government and people of Sierra\nLeone for those brave and dedicated ambassadors of\npeace from the United Kingdom, Zambia, the Ukraine\nand Bulgaria who lost their lives in the recent\nhelicopter accidents in my country.\nDespite our optimism for peace and stability in\nSierra Leone, past experience of adventurous attempts\nby the rebels to renege on their obligations under peace\nagreements have taught us a lesson: We have to remain\nconstantly vigilant. The safety and security of the\npeople will remain high on our national agenda, as will\nthe process of consolidating the peace through\nsustainable development. This is why we would like\nthe United Nations, especially the Security Council, to\ncontinue to generate the necessary international support\nfor our post-conflict and peace-building effort.\nIn this connection, we would like to draw the\nattention of the international community and those who\nassist us in the implementation of our disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration programme to the fact\nthat the disarmament and demobilization of ex-\ncombatants will soon come to a successful end.\nHowever, the process of reintegration remains crucial.\nWe could lose the gains we have made in the peace\nprocess if we allow the reintegration of ex-combatants\nto collapse for lack of adequate funding. As President\nKabbah pointed out recently, we also have tens of\nthousands of young people who have never seen,\ntouched or used an AK-47 rifle or a rocket-propelled\ngrenade. They, too, are waiting to be integrated into the\nmainstream of our economic and social sectors.\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\nappeal to the international community, as a matter of\nurgency, to help us remove some of the root causes of\nconflict by increasing support for our reintegration and\nintegration programmes for the benefit of youths. We\nshould no longer allow the legitimate social and\neconomic needs or grievances of these young people to\nbe exploited by ruthless warlords whose sole objective\nis to drain our precious mineral resources for their own\nselfish ends.\nSpeaking of diamonds, I would like to inform this\nAssembly that our diamond certification system,\nestablished under Security Council resolution 1306\n(2000), has so far been a major success. First, there has\nbeen a substantial increase in revenue from legitimate\ndiamonds since the system was established just over a\nyear ago. Secondly, it has also helped to reduce the\nincidence of an old problem that preceded the\nphenomenon of conflict or blood diamonds \u2014 namely,\nsmuggling. My Government is in the process of\nupdating the status of the certification system in its\nthird report to the Security Council through the\nCommittee that is monitoring the implementation of\nresolution 1306 (2000).\nThe sacrifices we have made for peace in Sierra\nLeone are not for Sierra Leoneans alone; they are also\nin the interest of peace and stability in the Mano River\nUnion triangle in particular and the West African\nsubregion as a whole. The recent rapprochement at the\nministerial level, followed by meetings of the Joint\nSecurity Committee and the initiative launched by the\nMano River Union Women Peace Network in the three\ncountries \u2014 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2014 augur\nwell for the proposed Mano River Union summit\nmeeting. Meanwhile, I can assure the Assembly that\nPresident Kabbah remains committed to his\ndetermination to help restore adherence to the principle\nof good-neighbourliness in the Union. This should lead\nto a revitalization of economic cooperation\nprogrammes among the three countries. We must admit\nthat conflict and tension in the Union have had a\nnegative impact on the ability of ECOWAS to\nconcentrate on the principal objective for which it was\ncreated, namely, economic cooperation and\ndevelopment.\nWe are aware that primary responsibility for\nalleviating poverty, stimulating economic growth and\nreducing conflicts and their often disastrous\nconsequences lies in the hands of the developing\ncountries themselves. We are also aware that\ndevelopment requires sound fiscal policies and rational\nmanagement of both our human and natural resources.\n19\n\nHowever, the international consensus is that\nsustainable development also requires greater\ncooperation between developing and developed\ncountries in such areas as trade, debt relief and external\nfinancing. In this regard, Sierra Leone, one of the least\ndeveloped countries in the world, eagerly looks\nforward to the results of the forthcoming Conference\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\non Sustainable Development.\nThere are many pressing and unresolved\nproblems on the international peace and security\nagenda of the United Nations. One of them is the\nsituation in Palestine. It remains the core issue in the\nsearch for peace in the Middle East. In our view, it also\nbreeds tension, and directly fans the flames of war in\nother parts of the world. In the current state of affairs it\nis no longer enough to speak about the right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination. They have a\nright to an independent State of their own. In short, the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State is\nwell overdue. In terms of international peace and\nsecurity, we cannot afford any further delay.\nSierra Leone is obviously not a nuclear Power.\nHowever, as a member of the human family, we are\nconcerned about the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\nIndeed, we believe that these weapons pose the greatest\nthreat to human survival. Therefore, we shall continue\nto support universal adherence to regional and\ninternational disarmament and non-proliferation\ninstruments. For instance, Sierra Leone recently\nratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\nwhich we strongly believe is central to the question of\nthe vertical, or qualitative, proliferation of nuclear\nweapons.\nWe are also seriously concerned about the\nproliferation of conventional arms, including those that\nhave brought untold suffering to the people of Sierra\nLeone during the past 10 years.\nLast July, at the United Nations Conference on\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\nAll Its Aspects, we pleaded in vain for action to\nprevent the transfer of these weapons to non-State\nentities such as terrorists and rebels who commit\natrocities against innocent civilians. The recent\nterrorist attacks and the awareness that biological\nweapons in the hands of such non-State entities pose a\nthreat to us all should, in the view of my delegation,\nprod those Member States that were unable to support\nour plea last July to seriously reconsider their position\non this important issue of arms transfers to non-State\nentities. We also need their full support in the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action adopted at\nthat important Conference.\nIn conclusion, my delegation is convinced that\nthe international community has at its disposal the\ninstruments, institutions, strategies, targets and road\nmaps for counteracting and eradicating terrorism, HIV/\nAIDS, malaria, hunger, malnutrition and other deadly\nforces, through closer multilateral cooperation.\nLet the fifty-sixth session of this Assembly,\nwhich was interrupted by the common enemy of\nterrorism, go down in history as the new multilateral\ncooperation session, one that should inspire all nations,\nlarge and small, nuclear and non-nuclear, to deal\nresolutely with the other common enemies of the\nhuman race.\n\n\n"

We join the\ninternational community in extending our deep\ncondolences to the people of the United States in\ngeneral and the bereaved families in particular.\nWherever and by whomever committed, terrorism in\nany form or under any circumstances is unjustifiable.\nAs a nation that has had bitter experiences with\nterrorism, both on its own soil and against its aircraft\nand diplomatic service abroad, Myanmar is against\nterrorism in all forms and manifestations.\nThe challenges of combating terrorism are both\ndifficult and complex. Therefore, it is essential that the\ninternational community come together under the aegis\nof the United Nations to overcome the enormous\nchallenge.\nIn this regard, I commend the Secretary-General\nfor organizing a treaty event at United Nations\nHeadquarters from 10 to 16 November 2001. Myanmar\nis already a party to 4 of the 12 conventions on\nterrorism, and on 12 November we signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism and acceded to the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\nIn the aftermath of the economic crisis of 1997,\nAsian countries are still striving to return to a path of\nsustained growth. However, the current slowdown in\nthe major economies of the world is threatening to\nnegate whatever progress they have made. As these\neconomies continue with structural reforms to sustain\ntheir economic recovery, they are confronted with an\n17\n\ninternational economic and trading environment that is\nnot very encouraging.\nThis situation is creating difficulties, especially\nfor many developing countries and economies in\ntransition. Commodity prices are declining due to\nweakening world demand. External financing\nconditions are also worsening. Factors such as\nindebtedness, declining official development assistance\nand low levels of domestic and foreign investment\ncontinue to undermine the programmes of the most\nvulnerable States. It is against this unfavourable\nbackdrop that Myanmar is striving to achieve economic\ndevelopment of the country.\nThere are also hindrances to our efforts to\npromote the well-being of our people, such as denial of\nofficial development assistance and the application of\nunilateral and coercive economic measures. However,\nwe are resolute in our efforts to achieve our goals by\nrelying on our domestic resources and internal strength\nand by putting our comparative advantages to optimum\nuse. Our sustained national efforts for development\nhave resulted in 8.4 per cent average annual growth\nduring the last five-year plan, resulting in a substantial\nincrease in per capita income and in better living\nstandards for the people.\nIn their respective endeavours to bring about\neconomic development and social progress, the\ndeveloping countries continue to face formidable\nchallenges. The debt burden, the declining flow of\nofficial development assistance, the lack of market\naccess and access to technology, and the decline in\nforeign direct investment continue to persist. The\nUnited Nations must play a central role in helping\nthose countries to help themselves.\nIn this regard, we recognize the important role of\nUnited Nations funds and programmes in international\ncooperation for development. However, their important\nrole should not be undermined by practices that are not\nin conformity with the principles underpinning the\noperation of those funds and programmes. Moreover,\nthey should not be used as a platform for exerting\npressure on a country that needs and deserves\ninternational cooperation in its development efforts.\nWhile acknowledging the role of various funds\nand programmes, we are particularly appreciative of\nthe important role of the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP). In United Nations operational\nactivities for development, UNDP serves as the\nprincipal instrument for capacity-building in\ndeveloping countries. Myanmar regrets, however, that\nthe United Nations Development Programme is not\nallowed to have a country programme for Myanmar.\nWhile UNDP continues its useful activities in\nMyanmar, it is, however, prohibited from promoting\ncapacity-building for reasons other than those for\nwhich UNDP was created.\nIn the present context of an extremely difficult\neconomic and trading environment, the denial of the\nright of development to a country in need of\ninternational cooperation is a matter that deserves\nappropriate redress.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a serious\nchallenge to the international community. The response\nof the international community and the efforts being\nmade at the national, regional and international levels\nto counter this global threat are very encouraging.\nHowever, the real challenge for us is the high level of\nresources needed to combat this disease effectively. It\nis therefore most welcome that a global AIDS and\nhealth fund has been established. With the\ndetermination and will that has been demonstrated in\ncurrent efforts, and strengthened with adequate\nresources, we are convinced that we will eventually\nwin this war on HIV/AIDS. Myanmar fully recognizes\nthe nature and gravity of the HIV/AIDS problem, is\ntaking the necessary actions at the national level and is\nenhancing our cooperation at the regional and\ninternational levels.\nLet me take this opportunity to apprise the\nAssembly of the political situation in our country. As\nthe Assembly is aware, Myanmar is in the process of\nestablishing a multiparty democracy with a sound\neconomy. All of the measures that we have taken are\ndirected towards that end in a focused manner. This is\nthe course of action which we will pursue steadfastly to\nits logical end - that is, until democracy is firmly\nestablished. We have learned from bitter experience, as\nwell as from the lessons of other countries with similar\nexperiences, and we are taking great care to ensure that\nthe transition to a new system is peaceful, smooth and\neffective and that the foundations we are striving to lay\nare placed on firm ground.\nWe have also been taking effective measures for\nnational reconciliation. We have reached arrangements\nwith 17 out of 18 armed groups, who are now joining\nhands with the Government in national development\n18\n\nendeavours. In the same vein, we are also making\nnational reconciliation efforts with the political parties.\nHere, let me stress what the Secretary-General has so\nrightly outlined in his report. Our national\nreconciliation efforts are home-grown, and our goal of\nbuilding a peaceful and democratic society can be\nsuccessfully achieved only by the people of Myanmar.\nMyanmar continues to make relentless efforts to\ncombat the scourge of narcotic drugs. We have made\nconsiderable headway in the suppression of opium and\nheroin. The latest figures show that opium production\nhas declined by 38 per cent. To achieve this, we tackled\nthe problem in a holistic manner. We have strengthened\nour legislation; we have enhanced our enforcement\ncapacity; and we have combined these measures with a\ndevelopment programme to find alternative livelihoods\nfor people in remote areas, so that they do not have to\nresort to growing opium.\nWhile we are taking effective measures against\nthe cultivation, production and trafficking of the opium\npoppy, we are also taking action against the danger of\namphetamine-type stimulants, which are relatively new\nbut equally dangerous narcotic drugs. Due to their\navailability and affordable price, the widespread use of\nthese stimulants among young people has led to an\nalarming situation in our subregion. This situation calls\nfor renewed efforts at the national level and for\nstepped-up cooperation at the subregional level.\nTo enhance cooperation at the regional level,\nministers from Myanmar, China, Thailand and Laos\nmet in Beijing in August and agreed to cooperate\nclosely to fight the problem. Our efforts have achieved\ntangible results: the seizure of drugs and the arrest of\nthe traffickers involved.\nMyanmar fully understands how important and\nurgent it is to combat this scourge afflicting mankind.\nWe have made a firm commitment at the highest\npolitical level and are determined to translate these\ncommitments into practical and effective measures\nwithin the set time-frame.\nI wish to inform the Assembly that we have also\nenhanced our cooperation with the United Nations\nsystem. We continue our cooperation with Mr. Razali\nIsmail, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, who\ncompleted his fifth visit to the country in August.\nAnother visit towards the end of this year has also been\nagreed to. Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, Special\nRapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights,\nvisited the country twice earlier this year.\nDetermined to resolve the issue of forced labour,\nMyanmar is fully cooperating with the International\nLabour Organization (ILO). In September 2001, an\nILO high-level team paid a three-week visit to\nMyanmar to objectively assess the practical\nimplementation and actual impact of the legislative,\nexecutive and administrative measures adopted by the\nGovernment to eliminate the practice of forced labour.\nThe Government extended its full cooperation to the\nteam in arranging its meetings in Myanmar and its fact-\nfinding trips to various parts of the country identified\nby it. What was most important, we gave the team\nunfettered freedom and unlimited access to carry out its\nmandate successfully.\nLet me now make a few observations concerning\nthe work of the Organization. Last year, our heads of\nState and Government and leaders gathered in the\nGeneral Assembly Hall and charted a road-map to\nguide our future actions. All our work and energy must\nbe directed towards effectively using that road-map to\nachieve a peaceful and developed world. Peace and the\ndevelopment of nations are the twin objectives of our\nOrganization. While globalization has, to a\nconsiderable degree, reduced our planet to the village\nlevel, the issues we face in achieving peace and\ndevelopment are global in scale and complexity. As we\nare acutely aware, no one country is capable of\nresolving those issues on its own. It is only through\nconcerted efforts and genuine partnerships that we will\nbe able to address those issues of a global scale.\nWe believe that as the only universal forum with\nthe most comprehensive mandate, the United Nations\nmust play a central role and coordinate our actions in\nthose efforts. At the same time, the United Nations\nmust be further strengthened and vitalized to be able to\ncarry out its global mission effectively and\nexpeditiously. That will require the further\nstrengthening of its organs and institutions. For our\npart, we must provide the Organization with the\nresources and the level of support needed to implement\nits mandate. It is also vitally important to give real\neffect to our pledges through concrete actions if our\nOrganization is to be successful in building a world of\npeace and development."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe sudden\nspeeding up of events that has taken place since the\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and their\npotential impact on the future of humankind only\nconfirms our impression that our world is experiencing\ndevelopments that could, one the one hand, open the\ndoor to hopes for peace, stability and progress, or, on\nthe other, jeopardize these hopes and imperil prospects\nfor a better world.\nThe threat is real. We therefore must mobilize our\nefforts to an even greater extent to ensure that the\nideals of peace, solidarity, justice and tolerance can\ntriumph throughout the world.\nHatred and intolerance took centre stage on 11\nSeptember, when the United States, our host country,\nwas the target of terrorist acts of indescribable and\nunjustifiable barbarity.\nIn the face of the outrage and horror to which\nthose events gave rise, the President of the Republic of\nTogo immediately condemned these heinous attacks,\nwhich he called a veritable declaration of war, and\nwhich, regrettably, caused the death of nationals of\nnearly 80 countries, including mine.\nOnce again, in paying tribute to all of those who\nlost their lives in the tragedy of 11 September and in\nconveying once again our deep condolences to the\nAmerican people, I should like to express the fervent\nhope that, thanks to our collective efforts and to a\ngreater solidarity in our actions, we will be able to\ndefeat evil.\nBecause we have on several occasions been the\nvictims of terrorist acts, Togo is aware of the\nsignificance and seriousness of the consequences of\nsuch acts of murderous violence, which are committed\nwith complete disregard for respect for human life and\nfor human dignity.\nThe joint combat against international terrorism,\nin all its manifestations and wherever necessary, is a\ntask of great importance for the entire international\ncommunity, because no one is safe from this scourge.\nThis fight should not be understood as a confrontation\nbetween civilizations, cultures or religions. Identifying\nthe true causes of this scourge and finding appropriate\nsolutions to combat it \u2014 this is the true challenge that\nwe must meet.\nIn this context, it is important to do everything\nwe can to ensure the broadest possible participation of\nStates in the strict application of the 12 international\nconventions dealing with specific aspects of terrorism\nand to step up negotiations on the comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism.\nLikewise, it is essential for all States to cooperate\nclosely with the mechanism has been set up by the\nSecurity Council pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) in\norder to combat this scourge in an efficient and\ncoordination manner. My country is already complying\nwith its responsibilities in the context of this process.\n12\n\nHowever, cooperation in eradicating this scourge\nneeds to be strengthened at the regional level as well.\nThus our West African subregion notes with\nsatisfaction that it has set up functional structures to\ncombat terrorism, through the quadripartite agreement\nbetween Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria; and the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) Protocol on Mutual Assistance, Protocol\non Non-Aggression and Protocol relating to the\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management,\nResolution, Peacekeeping and Security.\nBefore continuing my statement, I should like to\njoin my voice to those of previous speakers in\nextending to Mr. Han, on behalf of my delegation and\non my own behalf, our warmest congratulations on his\nelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that, thanks to his\nexperience and diplomatic skills, the work of this\nsession will definitely be successful.\nI should like also to extend my warmest\ncongratulations to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, who so ably guided the work of the fifty-fifth\nsession.\nFinally, I should like to take this opportunity to\npay well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan. Thanks to\nhis skill and his vision, our Organization has regained\nits credibility and its primary role in the management\nof international affairs. His unanimous re-election to a\nsecond term of office, and the fact that he won the\nNobel Peace Prize for 2001 together with the United\nNations, attest clearly to the great confidence that the\nentire international community places in him.\nThere cannot be economic progress nor\nsustainable development outside an environment of\npeace, security and stability. Togo\u2019s foreign policy has\nalways been based on the principle of seeking peace,\nstability and solidarity between nations.\nSince coming to power, the President of our\nRepublic, Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, has worked to\nconsolidate peace. This requires the participation of all\ncitizens in political life as well as the construction of a\nstate that is truly based on the rule of law, in which all\nindividuals can make their contribution and use their\nskills in the building of a prosperous nation.\nThe President had already begun to democratize\npolitical life in Togo by the 1980s. Like any other\nhuman endeavour, the promotion of democracy and\ngood governance and the consolidation of the rule of\nlaw are part of a process that, by necessity, can be\nperfected and can evolve and that fits in a given time\nand place.\nWith various forms of support and aid from our\nforeign partners, this process is taking its course and\nregistering tangible and real progress. We should like\nhere to express our profound thanks to all our\ninternational partners who have supported us in our\nambition to pursue and achieve political reforms\nnecessary to consolidate democracy and rule of law in\nTogo.\nThe upcoming legislative elections, in March\n2002, are organized with the aim of making this\nambition more of a reality. In this regard, we are\ngrateful to the United Nations for having recently sent\nan assessment mission to Togo to make\nrecommendations in light of these elections. The long-\nawaited upcoming legislative elections, as well as the\nproper conduct of the balloting, will, without a doubt,\ncontribute to boosting the economy of our country.\nFor it is true that progress made in pursuing any\nprocess of democratization and establishing the rule of\nlaw can be protected only if accompanied by a\nsignificant improvement in the living conditions of the\npopulations concerned. In other words, to be lasting,\nthe advances in promoting civil and political rights and\nfundamental liberties should absolutely be underpinned\nby the real enjoyment of economic and social rights.\nIn such a context, we may well be surprised at the\nunjustified continuation of the economic sanctions\nimposed on Togo by our main partners in development\nfor almost 10 years. What has my country done to\ndeserve such a fate? What has the Togolese population\ndone to justify its daily suffering? Why apply this\npolicy of double standards? Given the way Togo is\nbeing treated, are we to see this as an concrete\nillustration of the views of the renowned, classic\nFrench writer Jean de la Fontaine: \u201cDepending on\nwhether you are powerful or weak, the judgement of\nthe court will make you white or black\u201d?\nThe Togolese people still cannot understand why\nTogo \u2014 which was one of the first countries in Africa\nto be committed to the path of democratization and\npolitical reforms and which, in all objectivity, made\nprogress in this area \u2014 continues to be subjected to\nsuch injustice. I would like to make once again an\nurgent appeal, on behalf of the Togolese Government\n13\n\nand people, for normalization of our cooperative\nrelations with our development partners.\nPeace, security and stability in Africa are still at\nthe heart of our concerns. We note with satisfaction\nthat significant progress in settling conflicts has\nrecently been made on the continent. I would cite by\nway of example the cessation of conflict between\nEthiopia and Eritrea, or the gradual return to normal\nconstitutional life in Comores, despite the vicissitudes\nof the last few days. All this was made possible thanks\nto the efforts of the Organization of African Unity, the\nOrganization of la Francophonie and the League of\nArab States. These are glimmers of hope and signs of\nrelief.\nNonetheless, must remains to be done to bring\nabout lasting peace and security in certain parts of the\ncontinent, notably in the Mano River region, the Horn\nof Africa, the Great Lakes Region and Angola.\nThe serious crisis endures in the Middle East.\nViolence can only beget bitterness and resentment and\nperpetuate violence. The hellish cycle of violence that\nthe region has known for already more than a year \u2014\nin particular, in the occupied Palestinian territories \u2014\nhas certainly had an impact on the negotiations being\npursued with a view to reaching a just, final and\ncomprehensive settlement to the question of Palestine\nthat is at the heart of the conflict.\nIt is therefore important that the parties in\nconflict show greater proof of the necessary political\nwill in applying the agreements that have been reached\nand work to conclude other arrangements on the basis\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this\nrespect, Togo welcomes the positive developments that\nhave been recently made with respect to the evolution\nof the position of certain Member States on the\ncreation of a Palestinian State.\nHumanity has fully entered the twenty-first\ncentury, but the economic and social position of\ndeveloping countries remains of concern. In sub-\nSaharan Africa and in the least-developed countries in\nparticular, we are witnessing an ongoing deterioration\nof living conditions and the unprecedented\nmarginalization of these countries \u2014 a situation that\ncan only exacerbate misery and extreme poverty.\nDebt burden, the decline in export earnings and\nthe lack of sufficient resources for development have\ngreatly contributed to making social and economic\nconditions worse. Therefore more resources must be\nallocated to these areas. In addition to these\ninsurmountable difficulties, we now have the\npandemics of AIDS and malaria.\nAfrica, which is already organizing itself and\ntaking matters in hand, expects the international\ncommunity to make good on the commitments\nundertaken at the Millennium Summit. Against this\nbackground, we hope that the major encounters that\nwill take place in 2002 \u2014 the International Conference\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\non Sustainable Development \u2014 will be opportunities to\ntake appropriate measures that can genuinely\ncontribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.\nWe also hope that specific and substantial support will\nbe given to Africa in implementing its development\nplan, as contained in the New Partnership for\nDevelopment in Africa.\nAt the start of the millennium, with great changes\nunderway in the world, the United Nations still is,\nwithout a doubt, the centre for new hopes and\nexpectations of humanity. More than ever before, it has\nshown itself to be the appropriate framework in which,\ntogether, we can and must work to meet the numerous\nand complex challenges that humanity faces in the\ncontext of an increasingly inexorable process of\nglobalization.\nWhile continuing to work to maintain peace and\nsecurity, promote sustainable economic development\nand move towards eradicating the great pandemics, we\nalso must confront poverty, injustice, selfishness and\nexclusion, which, it seems to me, still are the source of\nmany problems that often lead to acts of violence,\nterrorism and armed conflict. Thus, and only thus, will\nit be possible for us to establish a new international\norder of greater justice, solidarity and humanity."

        "file_text": "\ufeffSir, let me begin, like\nothers, by congratulating you on having been elected\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. Let me also very warmly commend you on\nyour commitment to making the most efficient use of\nthe Assembly\u2019s time, including \u2014 if I may say \u2014 by\nbeginning meetings punctually. I also want to join other\nspeakers in congratulating the Secretary-General, Kofi\nAnnan, and the United Nations more generally on their\nheartily deserved receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September in\nWashington, D.C., and here in New York City were not\njust attacks on the United States. Australia, along with\nmore than 80 other nations, lost innocent civilians. We\nare united in our grief for the victims and their\nfamilies. Australia condemns these attacks and\nreaffirms unequivocally that terrorism is never justified\nand must never be tolerated.\nAustralia has joined the international coalition\nagainst terrorism. We have invoked our mutual security\npact for the first time with the United States, and we\nare contributing military forces to the campaign against\nthose responsible for the 11 September attacks.\nThe international community is obliged to close\nranks against terrorism. We must starve terrorists of\ntheir support \u2014 financial, political and moral. We must\ndeny terrorists safe haven. We must bring terrorists to\naccount.\nAustralia commends Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001) of 28 September, which targets\ncomprehensively the terrorist menace. We will work\nclosely with the Committee on Counter-Terrorism of\nthe Security Council.\nAustralia has introduced new measures to prevent\nand suppress the financing of terrorism and is already\nparty to all but one of the 12 international counter-\nterrorism instruments.\nA comprehensive convention against terrorism is\npotentially a very important symbol of global\ncommitment on this issue. As the Assembly is aware,\nAustralia has taken a leading role in the negotiations,\nreflecting our strong commitment to strengthening the\ninternational legal framework. While we are\nencouraged by the progress this past month, we join the\nSecretary-General in urging the parties to conclude the\nconvention without delay.\nThe events of 11 September underline how\nimportant it is that we maintain and strengthen\ninternational non-proliferation regimes governing\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. If we want\nto prevent the spread of ballistic missiles and\nassociated technology \u2014 and if we want to strengthen\nmechanisms relating to conventional weapons \u2014 then\nwe also need a stronger commitment to other arms\ncontrol and disarmament instruments as well.\nLet me turn now to East Timor. We all have a\ndeep interest in a stable, secure, viable and democratic\nEast Timor. East Timor is no longer an emergency, but,\ninstead, an emerging nation.\nHowever, much more needs to be done. East\nTimor remains vulnerable, and the role of the United\nNations is not complete. We need, after independence,\nan integrated United Nations mission of civilians,\npolice and peacekeepers, under a single Security\n4\n\nCouncil mandate funded from United Nations assessed\ncontributions.\nAustralia therefore welcomes the Security\nCouncil President\u2019s statement of 31 October endorsing\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s recommendations for a United\nNations successor mission in East Timor. We look\nforward to working with others over the coming\nmonths to set a solid and sensible mandate for a\nsuccessor mission.\nCooperative relations between East Timor and\nIndonesia are key to East Timor\u2019s longer-term security\nand to that of the region as a whole. We very much\nwelcome steps by both sides to resolve outstanding\nissues.\nWe welcome progress by the Indonesian\nGovernment to resolve the situation in refugee camps\nin West Timor, and we urge continued efforts to ensure\nsecurity and to facilitate the safe return of refugees.\nJustice and reconciliation are important to East\nTimor\u2019s longer-term stability and prosperity. Australia\nwelcomes steps by President Megawati Soekarnoputri\nto expand the jurisdiction of the ad hoc human rights\ncourt and her Government\u2019s commitment to bring to\njustice those who have perpetrated human rights crimes\nin East Timor. That commitment was reconfirmed in a\nmost welcome way in the Assembly yesterday by the\nForeign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Hassan Wirajuda.\nAustralia will continue to support East Timor\ngenerously. We have an agreement to share resources\nfrom the Timor Sea. We are helping to reduce poverty\nin East Timor and we are building East Timorese\ncapacity to govern peacefully and democratically. We\nurge others to support East Timor. This is our chance,\ncollectively in the international community, to ensure\nthat the United Nations historic mission in East Timor\nis remembered as a success.\nLet me talk about what we in Australia call\n\u201cpeople-smuggling\u201d. Australia has a proud history as a\nmajor country of migration. We are, as a result of over\na century of planned and managed legal migration, a\ntolerant multicultural society. We will continue as a\ncountry of migration and we will continue to take more\nthan our fair share of refugees.\nRegrettably, Australia is also increasingly a\nfavoured target for illegal migration, assisted by\nindividuals and criminal syndicates engaged in the\npernicious crime of people-smuggling. Many other\ncountries \u2014 as either transit or destination countries \u2014\nare also affected by this problem. As with other\ntransnational crimes, combating the phenomenon of\npeople-smuggling requires not just national, but also\nconcerted regional and multilateral action.\nPeople-smugglers are primarily organized crime\nsyndicates. They exploit their victims. They find their\nclients among people who have experienced conflict or\npersecution, economic downturn or extreme\nenvironmental breakdown. They target those desperate\nfor a better life. The loss recently of more than 350\nlives, when a people-smuggling boat headed for\nAustralia sank, is a tragic reminder of the human costs\ninvolved and of the callousness of people-smugglers.\nIrregular migration, facilitated by people-\nsmuggling, undermines the integrity of the\ninternational protection system. All countries share an\ninterest in protecting and strengthening the\ninternational protection system. To do so, we must\ntackle the problem of people-smuggling. A year ago, at\nthe Millennium Summit, leaders committed us to fight\npeople-smuggling and other transnational crimes. We\nshould redouble our efforts to do so. We need\ncoordinated, comprehensive approaches and concerted\ninternational action to address all its aspects. Root\ncauses in source countries need to be addressed. The\nhumanitarian and other needs of displaced persons in\ncountries of first asylum need to be addressed. Transit\ncountries and countries of destination need to\ncooperate more effectively.\nAustralia is working closely with its neighbours\nin the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen our capacity to\nprevent and deter people-smuggling and to bring\nperpetrators to justice. This will continue to be a high\npriority for my Government. We will also continue to\ncontribute to broader international efforts to deal with\nthe causes of irregular migration. These efforts, which\nhave the protection needs of refugees at their core, will\ncontinue while we work with others in our region and\ninternationally to combat illegal migration and people-\nsmuggling.\nAfghans fleeing the devastation of their homeland\npose a particular challenge to the international\ncommunity. A renewed focus and a more coordinated\nresponse are needed. Australia supports the efforts of\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees and those of the countries of first asylum\nto protect refugees in South-West Asia. We have\n5\n\nadvocated, consistently and strongly, a comprehensive\nresponse to the Afghan situation and substantially\nincreased our assistance to displaced and vulnerable\nAfghans in South-West Asia.\nThe international community faces grave new\nchallenges that threaten global peace and prosperity. At\nthe same time, as the Secretary-General said in his\nstatement, the challenges that faced us before 11\nSeptember \u2014 poverty, disease, development \u2014 have\nnot diminished. The need for international cooperation\nhas never been greater. It is therefore tremendously\nimportant that agreement was reached in Doha to\nlaunch the development round of world trade\nliberalization. Free trade, including in agriculture,\noffers benefits for all countries and is crucial for\ndeveloping countries to overcome poverty.\nFinally, I want to say that Australia stands ready\nto support international efforts to combat international\nterrorism and the spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Australia stands ready to ensure that recent\nUnited Nations successes \u2014 such as in East Timor \u2014\nhelp create vibrant and sustainable democracies in\nwhich people can be assured of their future and that of\ntheir children. Australia stands ready to contribute to\nsustained international action against people-smuggling\nat source, in transit and at destination. Australia urges\nthat this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\nmakes substantial progress towards those same goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

At \u201cground zero\u201d we\nnot only witness death and destruction, but we also see\nhow American values have come under siege. These\nare shared values. That is why the people I represent\nnow stand squarely behind the United States.\n14\n\nNo matter how deeply moved we may be, we\nmust look beyond our anger and frustration. Through\nour tears, we should discover opportunity. Through our\nbitterness, necessity. We must turn compassion into\nsolidarity, turn solidarity into common action. We need\na plan \u2014 in sum, we must turn to the United Nations.\nThe reaction on the part of the United Nations\nfrom the beginning of this crisis has been prompt and\nresponsible. As we meet this week, we must try and\nkeep the momentum going. And that is precisely what\nwe are doing. There is something I have sensed in the\nfirst few days of this general debate \u2014 namely,\ndetermination \u2014 determination to use the United\nNations to the fullest, on many different fronts, as a\ncentre of gravity for our common actions \u2014 common\naction for confronting a global threat \u2014 common\naction to maintain the international order.\nWith regard to that common action, what have we\nlearned so far? Three lessons. Lesson number one: the\nlaw must be firmly in place. There is a wealth of legal\nrules to guide us in these difficult times, and more of\nthem are on the way. A striking example of innovative\nrule-making was presented by the Security Council.\nBinding under Chapter VII of the United Nations\nCharter, resolution 1373 (2001) takes action not in\nregard to a specific threat or breach of the peace, not\nagainst a particular Member State, but takes action to\nconfront a phenomenon, a threat to our human values\nand economic interests \u2014 action against unidentified\nenemies. By writing new law, the Council has broken\nnew ground. Even more so, as it has set up the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor the\nimplementation of its decision.\nJointly with our partners in the European Union,\nwe are taking the implementation of resolution 1373\n(2001) very seriously. One aspect of it is especially\nimportant to us: promoting ratification of all of the\nvarious anti-terrorism conventions and monitoring\ncompliance. My country has some expertise to offer\nand will gladly share it. Meanwhile, an overarching\nconvention against terrorism is in the works. That is\ngood. But we are getting bogged down over a\ndefinition of terrorism. That is bad. Let us not forget\nthat it took us 20 years to produce a fairly useless\ndefinition of aggression. The world cannot wait that\nlong. Besides, when terrorism stares you in the face,\nyou\u2019ll know it.\nIn addition to rule-making, the real challenge lies\nin implementation. There, we should try harder. Let me\ngive you one example. Just before the summer we lost\nour momentum in the fight against biological warfare,\nand therefore the fight against bio-terrorism as well.\nThe world is a scary place. Anthrax is only one motive\nfor retrieving that momentum. Let us resume our\nefforts to turn the Biological Weapons Convention into\nan instrument that can really make a difference.\nThe need for stepping up security is immediate,\ncomprehensive and self-evident. In the aftermath of 11\nSeptember, nobody would deny it. But we need to be\nconcerned with the downside of security as well. Parts\nof our value system may come under pressure when\nGovernments seek to bolster public safety, and by this I\nmean human rights and fundamental freedoms. As\nprivate citizens we must be ready to make concessions\nand, yes, we will be forced to relinquish some freedom\nfrom intrusion in our private lives. But we cannot be\nexpected to live in a never-ending state of siege.\nWherever we have to strike a balance, we have to do so\nwisely. Long ago, we drew a line beyond which we\ncannot step \u2014 we cannot detract from the basic\nprinciples of human rights. Those principles are the\ntrue measure of our evolution and our civilization. If\nwe look the other way, we lose the moral high ground.\nIf we compromise, we lose out to those who besiege us.\nWhat is being put to the test here is our own\nvalue system. The core notion of that system is\ntolerance. Tolerance must, however, come from all\nsides. Tolerance is not the equivalent of giving in to\nintolerance. It does not imply that you bend at the\nslightest pressure. Tolerance means that you stand up to\nbe counted, that you draw a line in the sand when your\nbasic values are challenged. That is lesson number one.\nLesson number two: there are \u201cblack holes\u201d in the\ninternational order: failing States. We knew they were\nthere all along, but we have never been quite sure how\nto deal with them. Why should we care about failing\nStates? For several reasons. Look at the avalanche of\ndrugs, drug-money, weapons, and warlords spilling out\nof Afghanistan. Look at the blood diamonds streaming\nout of Africa. Think of how failing States attract\nparasites and how they turn into breeding grounds for\nterrorism, a haven for international crime. Think of\npeace and security, too; of how faltering countries\nbecome a liability to their own people; of how they\nflaunt the rules of the game and become a liability to\nthe whole neighbourhood.\n15\n\nHow do we deal with failing States? That\nquestion has never been answered in a systematic\nmanner. Any answer begins by recognition on the part\nof the Member States of this Organization that failing\nStates are a problem. Indeed, it may turn out to be the\nmost pernicious problem of the new century. From that\npoint on, we need to build a strategy, and do so\ntogether, within the framework of this Organization.\nWhat are we aiming at? How ambitious are we?\nCan we get in early to prevent failing States from\nfailing? Are there any early warning signals to look out\nfor? If we see those signals, do we have the means to\nact? And the political will? Once States are failing, do\nwe try and fix them? Do we settle for ending the\nfighting, wherever fighting is going on? Or do we limit\nourselves to humanitarian aid? These are all difficult\nquestions.\nMy belief is that outside intervention only goes so\nfar. I do not believe that massive injections of aid are\nthe right answer to failing States. For one thing, donors\nare reluctant to poor money down a black hole. But\nmore importantly: the solution should not come from\nthe outside, but rather from the inside. Even in the\npoorest country we will find well-educated citizens just\nas committed to building better lives for their children\nas in the rest of the world. They need a helping hand in\nbuilding good governance and a viable civil society.\nYet, ownership is paramount. Failing States, too, have\nthe capacity to fix themselves. Indeed, only if they fix\nthemselves will they no longer fail. Our role should be\nto help galvanize and to enable those capacities.\nLesson number three: the United Nations should\nbe doing the right things. As of today the Northern\nAlliance has entered the city of Kabul. That fact makes\nit even more imperative that we speak about\nAfghanistan in the United Nations.\nConsensus is growing that in post-Taliban\nAfghanistan, the United Nations should play a central\nrole. I certainly support that view. But a central role in\nwhat? For make no mistake: once the bombing stops,\nthe difficulties are still overwhelming. The country is\nnot only rugged and ruined, but also the size of Central\nEurope and packed with landmines. Factional fighting\nis bound to continue. The United Nations can do a lot,\nbut we need to beware of sending the United Nations\non an impossible mission. Instead of calling on the\nUnited Nations for functions where it is weak, let us\ncall on the United Nations for functions where it is\nstrong.\nFor example, take governance, a major worry to\nus all. Much as we seek to avoid it, a political vacuum\nis a realistic prospect, given that tribal conflict in\nAfghanistan is as old as the country\u2019s history. Afghans\nare a proud people. Hostility towards outside\nintervention is strong. The country needs to be\ngoverned from within. We may be looking both for a\nbroad-based interim Government and for a stable\npermanent structure. Without rushing to elections, we\nneed to be satisfied that such a political settlement is\nsupported by the population. In the process, the United\nNations might play a central role as a catalyst and as an\nadviser, but not as a governor. Afghanistan is not East\nTimor. It is important, too, that any settlement be\nsupported by the neighbouring States and by a Security\nCouncil resolution.\nAs regards security: in the absence of a functional\nnational army, transitional military arrangements are\nessential. They are essential to create a secure\nenvironment enabling reconstruction to begin and\nrefugees to return home. Choosing the right format is\ncritical. A conventional United Nations peacekeeping\noperation may not be a good idea \u2014 certainly not for\nthe country as a whole. Supplying peacekeepers is still\nvoluntary. Realistically, the troop levels needed for a\ncountry this size would almost certainly not be\nattained. Bosnia has taught us the hard lesson of the\nprice we pay when we send in a United Nations force\nthat is below par. We should be careful to avoid another\nSomalia. Different formats for security arrangements\nare possible, and we should reflect on them as a whole.\nIn a previous context, Ambassador Brahimi has offered\nus a wide spectrum of lessons learned about United\nNations peacekeeping. We should take them to heart.\nNow, as the Special Representative, he deserves all the\nsupport he needs from us.\nConcerning mine clearance: Afghanistan has\nmore landmines than any other country in the world.\nThe country cannot possibly get back on its feet as long\nas those mines are there. We have to get rid of them,\nand the United Nations can help us to do that. We must\npay the bills.\nAs to reconstruction: we should capitalize on\nwhere the United Nations is uniquely positioned either\nto deploy operations in the field or to coordinate those\nof others. Let us not limit our view to the part of the\n16\n\nUnited Nations here in New York, but rather broaden it\nto the entire United Nations system, including the\nDumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods institutions. We\nneed to bring the full weight of that system to bear on\nthe future of Afghanistan. I am speaking of the World\nHealth Organization and the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, of the Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\nand the United Nations Drug Control Programme, of\nthe International Labour Organization and the World\nFood Programme, of the United Nations Development\nProgramme and the World Bank. There is no need to\nset up a whole new mechanism. The Afghanistan\nSupport Group is fully entrenched, and we should use\nit.\nEspecially now, caught in the crossfire, the\nAfghan people are not to be envied. Their plight will\nnot be over once the guns are silent. Food stocks,\nhealth care, housing, utilities, schooling, agriculture \u2014\nthe list of concerns is a long one. But all of us need to\npush that agenda. We may not be part of the problem of\nAfghanistan, but we must be part of the solution.\nYet again, reconstruction cannot be imposed upon\na nation. Here, too, a sustainable recovery needs to\ncome from within. All the men, and especially the\nwomen of Afghanistan, must once again become the\nmakers of their own fate and future. The answer lies\nwith them.\nThe United Nations is not merely \u201can ineffective\nacronym\u201d, as a misguided message on the Internet\nwould have you believe. For global issues, multilateral\ncooperation is the only answer. Multilateralism is\nsolidarity worked into a plan. As I said, the reaction by\nthe United Nations system in the aftermath of 11\nSeptember has been prompt and responsible. In order\nto maintain that level of performance, we, the Member\nStates, will have to show the stamina, support and\ncommitment to make it happen. Our track record is not\nimpeccable. The United Nations can go no faster than\nwe will let it, which means we have to make it work.\nThis also means we have to provide it with all the\nresources, and the political will, to give it the push and\npunch we need.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nHis Majesty\u2019s Government, I should like to express\nonce again my warmest congratulations to the\nPresident on his election and our appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, President of\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would\nalso like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his\nre-election. We are extremely pleased that he is\ncontinuing to serve the United Nations. The award of\nthis year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize is a fine tribute to his\nwork and to the United Nations agencies and workers\nin the field, who have served us all with such\ndedication to the principles of the Charter.\nSadly, of course, this comes at a time when their\nwork is perhaps more crucial than ever before. The\natrocities committed in the United States on 11\nSeptember have rightly received the absolute\ncondemnation of all civilized people. There is no\njustification for terrorism. As we have stated both\nindividually and in our regional associations, Brunei\nDarussalam will continue to do all it can to work\nclosely with the United States and all members of the\nSecurity Council to play its part in overcoming the\ndirect challenge that terrorism poses to the proper\nconduct of international affairs.\nThe existence of terrorism is, however, a grim\nreminder that the United Nations agenda, set over the\nlast half of the twentieth century, has yet to be\ncompleted. There are many unwelcome legacies from\nthe past 50 years. Though none justify acts of terror,\nmany offer justification for deep resentment and\nprofound despair. Perhaps the most apparent of all at\nthis time is the situation in Palestine, where the justice\nimplicit in the Security Council\u2019s resolutions on\nPalestine is still denied to what is now a third\ngeneration of Palestinians. In this respect, we welcome\nthe recognition given by many world leaders, including\nthe President of the United States and the Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom, to the principle of a\nPalestinian State. Brunei Darussalam hopes that all\nconcerned and interested parties involved in the Middle\nEast peace process will act with urgency in order to\nbring this about.\nAs we all know, dispelling feelings of past\ninjustice is an extremely difficult task. In essence, we\nbelieve it must involve new approaches to security. We\nbelieve all members of all regional associations have a\ncrucial role in this. Brunei Darussalam is trying to do\nthis through the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in an approach that\nhas been taking shape over nearly a decade now. This\ninvolves all the nations of South-East Asia and our\npartners in North America, East Asia, Europe and\nOceania. We seek common understandings through\nconsultation and various confidence-building measures.\nMembers have recognized the complex nature of\nmodern conflict. They have accepted that its roots are\noften deep and intricately entwined. As elsewhere in\nthe world, it can be the result of long-standing\nterritorial claims, centuries-old animosities and\ninstinctive suspicions or conflicting ideologies. Or it\ncan be as basic as local land disputes or simple lack of\nbasic resources.\nWhatever the cause, however, the members\nbelieve the Forum is seeing signs of success. This year,\nfor example, it has been able to move things another\nstage forward and is now looking into the very\nchallenging area of preventive diplomacy. In short, the\nmembers see dialogue and consultation not as a series\nof meetings but as a process. As such, it may never\nend. In fact, in the long run, the process itself may\nindeed become the solution.\nThat, we think, is the framework within which the\nideas expressed at the Millennium Summit can be\npursued successfully. In short, we believe that the key\nto security today is the capacity to think locally,\nregionally and globally at the same time. To us this\nmeans that a positive, forward-looking United Nations\nis crucial. It is here that all these thoughts can truly\ncome together. It is here that all nations can renew and\nstrengthen the tolerance and friendship that are the real\nbuilding blocks of security.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation would like\nto congratulate the distinguished Foreign Minister of\nthe Republic of Korea on his election as President of\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have\nno doubt that under his able and wise stewardship he\nwill be able to guide the proceedings of this Assembly\nto a successful conclusion. Our congratulations also go\nto the other members of the Bureau, including your\ngood self, Sir.\nI should also like to join other speakers in\nexpressing my delegation\u2019s gratitude to Mr. Harri\nHolkeri for the excellent manner in which he conducted\nand guided the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nI should also like to congratulate Mr. Kofi Annan\non his re-election as Secretary-General for another\nfive-year term. We are confident that he will continue\nto serve the Organization with the same single-minded\ncommitment he has shown in the past. We also\ncongratulate him and the United Nations on being\nawarded the centennial Nobel Peace Prize. That is due\nrecognition of the many contributions that he and the\nOrganization have made in the service of the\ninternational community.\nWe are gratified that we are finally able to\nconvene the general debate after the uncertainties that\nwe have had to face in the wake of the horrific events\nof 11 September 2001. Malaysia strongly condemned\nthe terrorist attacks and shared the anguish of the\nAmerican people over the senseless deaths of so many\nthousands of innocent people. We once again express\nour profound condolences to the United States and\nother countries that lost their nationals in that tragedy.\nWe ourselves lost a number of our own and understand\nthe pain of the bereaved. As an Islamic country, we are\nvery much concerned that a group of misguided people,\nidentified as Muslims, carried out such terrible acts in\nthe name of our sacred religion. They have tarnished\nthe name of Islam, which stands for peace, and have\ntried to equate their creed of terror with that of our\nfaith, thereby doing a great disservice to our great\nreligion and our community. Fortunately, their ploy has\nnot worked. In this regard we are grateful to President\nGeorge W. Bush and other world leaders for\ncategorically rejecting the stereotyping and association\nof Islam and Muslims with terrorism. In this regard,\nevery effort should be made to ensure that people of\nthe Islamic faith are not discriminated against simply\nbecause of their faith, ethnic background or the country\nthey come from.\nOn an unrelated matter, my delegation extends its\nsincere condolences to the delegations of the United\nStates and the Dominican Republic, and those of other\nMember States, for the loss of their nationals in the\ntragic air crash that occurred yesterday on Long Island.\nMalaysia is ready to contribute to the global\neffort to combat the scourge of terrorism. In dealing\nwith the issue, there is a need for the international\ncommunity, through the United Nations, to work out a\nsound strategy incorporating all aspects of the problem.\nWhile we understand the natural urge for retribution\nagainst the people who are believed to be behind the\nheinous attacks and their supporters, we do not think\nmilitary actions are the best and most effective\nsolution, nor politically a wise one. We are concerned\nthat military actions may raise more problems than\nthey solve. A sound strategy should include, aside from\nthe military option, political/diplomatic efforts and\nlegal, economic and other measures. It should involve a\nlong and sustained campaign in an effort to get at and\ndestroy, once and for all, each and every root of the\nterrorist organization or organizations behind these\nattacks.\nA concerted and coordinated effort on the part of\nthe international community is the most appropriate\nand effective approach. For this purpose there is a need\nfor the convening of an international conference at the\nhighest level to consider the issue of terrorism in all its\naspects and manifestations, including the necessity of\nagreeing on the definition of what constitutes\nterrorism. That is important so that pure terrorism,\nwhich cannot be excused under any pretext, can be\ndifferentiated from the legitimate struggles of peoples\nunder colonial or alien domination and foreign\noccupation for self-determination and national\nliberation, as recognized by the relevant resolutions of\nthe United Nations and other international declarations.\nAgreement on the definition of terrorism is vitally\nimportant so as to clear up any ambiguities and\nuncertainties that may hamper international\ncooperation. Such a conference should also address the\nimportant issue of the root causes of, or factors that\nspawn, terrorism. Those factors may be political,\neconomic or social, but they must be addressed in all\n26\n\nseriousness and objectivity so that appropriate\nstrategies and practical and effective measures can be\nformulated to deal with them.\nAs for Afghanistan, there should be an immediate\ncessation of the current bombings in order to spare the\nhapless people of Afghanistan further harm and\nsuffering. They have suffered too long enough \u2014 20\nyears too long. They should be allowed to return to\ntheir villages and homes to prepare for the cold winter\nseason and Ramadan, which are fast approaching. The\ncessation of the bombings would also allow for the\nreturn of international relief workers so that they can\nresume their commendable humanitarian work.\nEnormous amounts of international assistance are\nrequired. We commend those countries that have\nresponded generously and appeal to those that have not\ndone so. We ourselves have set up an Afghanistan\nRelief Fund with a very positive response from both\nthe Government and the public. On the political/\ndiplomatic front, the United Nations should make every\neffort to bring peace to Afghanistan through a political\nsettlement. We hope that the debate that is now going\non in the Security Council on this issue will yield\nconstructive results.\nThe situation in Palestine and the Middle East\ncontinues to be a matter of serious concern to the\ninternational community. The issue must be urgently\naddressed, not only for its own sake but also to prevent\nit from being exploited by certain groups of people for\ntheir own ends. It is imperative, if enduring peace is to\nbe achieved in the Middle East, for the peace process\nto be revived on an urgent basis. We believe that the\nMitchell report offers a good basis for bringing the\nsituation back to the negotiating table. We commend\nthe Palestinian Authority for unambiguously accepting\nthe report. However, we regret that the Israeli side,\nwhile indicating general \u201cacceptance\u201d, rejected major\nparts of the report, including the call for the complete\ncessation of settlement activity, one of the main causes\nof the current cycle of violence in the occupied\nPalestinian territory.\nThe continued military offensive against the\nPalestinians raises questions about the sincerity of the\nIsraeli leadership to work for peace. The Israeli\nauthorities have tried to cow the Palestinian people by\nan overwhelming use of force, using an assortment of\nits formidable arsenals. That excessive use of force has\nresulted in more than 800 Palestinians being killed and\nmore than 20,000 being wounded. Regrettably, the calls\nof the international community have fallen on deaf ears\nas the Israeli forces continue their offensive against the\nPalestinians on the pretext of ending the campaign\nagainst terrorism. The aggressive actions by the\noccupying Power must cease if peace is to be given a\nchance to grow.\nThere is no military solution to the problem.\nIndeed, the provocative measures taken by Israel will\nonly aggravate the situation. We therefore strongly urge\nthe Israeli Government to desist from pursuing a\nmilitary solution. A just, comprehensive and lasting\nsolution is possible only through a negotiated political\nsettlement \u2014 a process that the international\ncommunity and this body must actively pursue. This\nmust include the complete withdrawal of Israel from all\nArab and Palestinian land occupied since 1967,\nincluding the city of Al-Quds al-Sharif and the\noccupied Syrian Golan. We also reaffirm our support\nfor the establishment of an independent State of\nPalestine, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Only\nthe implementation of all international resolutions on\nthe Palestinian issue can guarantee lasting peace\nbetween Israel and Palestine. We once again call on\nIsrael to comply with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and all other relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\nAssembly. Equally, we look forward to the return of the\nSyrian Golan without further delay. We hope to see a\nfuture environment that will bring development and\nopportunities in a peaceful and stable Middle East.\nMalaysia has consistently voiced its opposition to\nthe use of sanctions as an instrument of collective\npunishment. No one can deny its debilitating effects on\nthe general populace of the affected countries. We\ntherefore strongly urge the international community, in\nparticular the Security Council, to seriously review the\nimpact of sanctions on Member States, particularly\nthose imposed on Iraq and Libya, which in our view\nshould be lifted as soon as possible as they have\nalready served their purpose.\nThe danger of a nuclear holocaust remains real\nand serious. We should strive for the ultimate objective\nof a world free of weapons of mass destruction \u2014\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We should\nmake every effort to strengthen all existing nuclear-\nrelated disarmament, arms control and reduction\nmeasures. The multilateral search for genuine measures\nfor disarmament and non-proliferation, particularly in\n27\n\nthe nuclear area, must remain the highest priority on\nthe global disarmament agenda.\nAfter more than 20 years of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, the United Nations finally recognized its\ncatastrophic impact on populations around the world\nand convened a special session for an expanded\nresponse to the pandemic. It is now up to the\ninternational community to take resolute and concerted\naction to combat this scourge and to acknowledge that\nthe world\u2019s most affected populations are also among\nthe poorest and lack the much-needed resources to act\nalone. With about 95 per cent of all HIV-infected\npeople living in developing countries, it is essential\nthat every assistance be given to them to combat the\nscourge. We hope that a review conference will be\nconvened a few years from now to assess how far we\nhave come in our fight against this devastating disease.\nRacism constitutes one of the most heinous forms\nof human rights violations, not only in itself, but as it\nalso gives rise to other egregious forms of systematic\nhuman rights violations such as colonialism, slavery\nand genocide. These have in turn resulted in poverty,\nunderdevelopment, marginalization and social\nexclusion for far too many. We are therefore heartened\nthat the outcome of the World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance, held in Durban recently, contained\nelements that will further our efforts to eradicate\nracism, the most prominent of which is the recognition\nby the international community that slavery and the\nslave trade are crimes against humanity. Unfortunately,\nwe view the outcome documents as inadequate as they\ndo not sufficiently address the plight of the Palestinian\npeople, who are victims of policies based on\ndiscrimination and exclusion.\nWe look forward to the upcoming special session\non children as an affirmation of the centrality of\nchildren to our common future and a positive proof of\nour commitment to ensuring the survival, protection\nand development of all children around the world.\nWhile many of the goals set by the World Summit for\nChildren have been achieved, an estimated 600 million\nchildren are still struggling to survive, eat and learn on\nless than $1 a day. Let us also not overlook the plight\nof children affected by sanctions, such as the hapless\nchildren of Iraq, many of whom do not survive beyond\nthe age of five.\nMany of us in the developing world had\nwelcomed, indeed embraced, globalization almost\nunquestioningly as if it were a panacea for all our\nproblems, only to be disillusioned over time when we\nfound that rather than a holistic process benefiting all\nof humanity, it was being pursued more often than not\nas a strategy for the benefit of a few. While the world is\nricher today, millions of people are still living in\nabsolute poverty, suffering from want, sickness and\nmalnutrition. Globalization is a complex process, with\nas many opportunities as challenges. While the impact\nof globalization is profound and pervasive, not all of it\nis necessarily positive. As we embrace it there is a need\nto ensure that we minimize its negative impact,\nparticularly on the developing countries.\nIf globalization in its present form is pursued,\ncharacterized, inter alia, by weakened national\nsovereignty and growing ownership and control of new\ntechnologies by powerful nations, it will not be the\nuniversal remedy it was thought to be. The Asian\nfinancial crisis demonstrated forcefully the downside\nof globalization. It demonstrated the inherent\ninstability of the world economic system, in which\ntrade and economic liberalization have not necessarily\nled to faster growth and development for the\ndeveloping countries. What is clear is that growth and\ndevelopment require an enabling international\nenvironment and international support that can promote\ngrowth with equity for the benefit of all.\nTo enable developing countries to participate in\nand benefit equally from globalization, adequate\nfunding for development, among other things, is\nrequired. It is therefore most disheartening to see the\nsteady decline over the years in the volume of official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to developing\ncountries. The continued need for an inflow of ODA\nand new and additional financial resources will become\neven more critical with the advancement of\nglobalization and the shift to the new knowledge-based\neconomy. Unless the ODA situation improves, the\ndeveloping countries will be further marginalized in a\nrapidly globalizing world economy, characterized by\nrapid change, high technology and stiff competition.\nThe developing countries, particularly the least\ndeveloped, must therefore continue to be assisted in a\nmore sustained fashion in order to bring about a more\nequitable distribution of growth and economic\nprosperity. The developing countries, for their part,\n28\n\nmust put their house in order by adopting sound\neconomic policies.\nThe issue of financing for development is\nparticularly relevant and vitally important in solving\nthe problems of development faced by many countries.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, in Mexico early next year, will provide\nthe opportunity for us to achieve international\nconsensus on issues pertaining to financing for\ndevelopment in all its aspects. We thank the\nGovernment of Mexico for its willingness to host that\nimportant Conference and look forward to participating\nconstructively in Monterrey. We hope that the\nConference will be able to address the core problems\nrelating to financing for development, including other\nsystemic issues such as the reform of the international\nfinancial architecture, on which, in spite of a general\nrecognition of the need for reform, there has been no\nprogress thus far.\nAs an innovative source of financing for\ndevelopment, the Conference in Monterrey could also\nconsider, inter alia, the possibility of establishing an\nappropriate system of international taxation for the\npurpose of infrastructure-building in the least\ndeveloped countries. This international tax, which was\nsuggested by my Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir\nMohamad, will be contributed by those countries that\nhave benefited from international trade, over and above\nthe economic aid given by them to the developing\ncountries. Malaysia is quite prepared to contribute to\nsuch an infrastructure tax.\nThe challenge facing developing countries in\nintegrating themselves into the international trading\nsystem lies in their ability to fully and actively\nparticipate in the multilateral trading system.\nRegrettably, many developing countries have not\nbenefited from global trade liberalization because of\ntheir inability to have access to the markets of\ndeveloped countries. Although globalization carries\nwith it the notion of free trade, many developed\ncountries maintain protectionist regimes and subsidies\nas basic instruments of economic policy, even as they\ninsist on opening up the markets of the developing\ncountries in the name of globalization. It is also\ndisappointing to the developing countries that,\nstructurally, little has been done in the area of trade to\nimprove their ability and capability to compete in the\nglobal market. There is, therefore, an urgent need to\nfacilitate the integration of the developing countries\ninto the global trading system through, inter alia, the\nspecial differential measures provided for under the\nUruguay Round. A new round, should it be launched,\nshould ensure that negotiations effectively address the\nparticular concerns and problems of developing\ncountries. However, any negotiations will have to\nformally recognize that the least developed\ncountries \u2014 indeed, for that matter, many of the\ndeveloping countries \u2014 have neither the financial nor\nhuman resources to meet their existing obligations, let\nalone the outcome of future negotiations. In this regard\nwe believe that the role of the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as\none of the few mechanisms concerned with the\ndevelopment of the developing countries, is of the\nutmost importance. We hope that UNCTAD will\ncontinue to play a leading role in helping developing\ncountries, particularly in efforts to reach the\nMillennium Declaration\u2019s development target of\nhalving poverty by the year 2015.\nWith regard to the situation in Africa, my\ndelegation welcomes the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration adopted last year, which, among other\nthings, pledged to pay special attention to meeting the\nspecial needs of Africa. The international community\nmust continue to assist African countries in their\ndevelopment needs. We should continue to assist our\nAfrican brothers in their struggle for lasting peace,\npoverty eradication and sustainable development.\nMalaysia, for its part, has been able to make a modest\ncontribution through the Malaysian Technical\nCooperation Programme, launched in 1981. To date,\nmany participants from African countries have taken\npart in various short-term and medium-term courses in\nthe public, administration and technical fields in\nMalaysia. We have also developed economic relations\nwith some African countries based on the concept of\nsmart partnership, involving Governments and the\nprivate sector, with the goal of promoting sound and\nsustainable economic activities to ensure a win-win\nrelationship for all. Within our limited resources,\nMalaysia looks forward to further consolidating our\ncooperation and solidarity with Africa in the spirit of\nSouth-South cooperation.\nMalaysia welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s\npledge to move the United Nations from a culture of\nreaction to a culture of prevention. This culture should\nbe the cornerstone of the Organization\u2019s collective\nsecurity system for this century. It is a far better and\n29\n\nmore cost-effective approach, in financial as well as in\nhuman terms, than mounting any operation or activity\nafter a conflict has erupted. We are pleased to note that\nthe Secretary-General continues to pursue that culture\nwith the relevant regional organizations in order to\nfurther enhance a comprehensive approach by drawing\non regional preventive strategies. We urge the\nSecretary-General to continue to consult the relevant\nregional or subregional groups in this regard.\nIn conclusion, I should like to raise an issue that\nwas mentioned by my Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir\nMohamad, when he addressed the fifty-fourth session\nof the General Assembly. The problem relates to\nimmunities granted to nationals of Member States by\nvirtue of the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and\nImmunities of the United Nations and the 1947\nConvention on the Privileges and Immunities of\nSpecialized Agencies once they are appointed as\nofficials of the United Nations, such as a rapporteur.\nWhile Malaysia acknowledges the need for immunities\nto be granted to ensure that these officials are able to\ncarry out their mandate effectively, it seems that they\nare able to hide behind this cloak of immunity for\nevery criticism made of their own Government,\nincluding words that fall outside their mandate. Surely\neven they should be treated as ordinary citizens,\ngoverned by the laws of the land, when they are not\nofficially \u201con mission\u201d. My delegation calls for clear\nguidelines to govern the conduct of United Nations\nofficials, especially when residing in their own\ncountries, so that their actions fall strictly within their\nmandates and that they will enjoy immunities there\nonly at such times as they are officially performing\ntheir functions as United Nations officials, and not all\nyear round. Surely, also, there should be a better basis\nfor the appointment of United Nations officials \u2014 a\nnominee should be one who is known for his or her\nneutral or unbiased views, and not who, in the words of\nmy Prime Minister \u201cis well known for his virulent\nattacks\u201d \u2014 to report on any given matter. Surely on\nthis issue the United Nations would be among the first\nto agree that while there is a need to protect and ensure\nthe freedom and impartiality of its officials, it must\nalso, at the same time, protect the rights and interests\nof its Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We will certainly make our contribution to\nthe process of reflection that the international\ncommunity will undertake together throughout this\nsession to elaborate measures aimed at the eradication\nof terrorism.\nBefore proceeding, I should like warmly to\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election to the presidency\nof the General Assembly at this session, as well as the\nother members of the Bureau. His expertise in\ninternational affairs, together with his wisdom, will\nguarantee the success of our work, and the delegation\nof the Central African Republic would like to assure\nhim of its cooperation. My delegation greatly\nappreciated the skilful way in which his predecessor\nconducted the work of the Millennium Assembly.\nWe would also like to address, on behalf of the\nCentral African Republic, our warmest congratulations\nto Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as Secretary-\nGeneral. He has been honoured for his commitment to\nthe cause of the Organization by the award of the\nNobel Peace Prize, which is a tribute both to him and\nto the United Nations as a whole. He can continue to\ncount upon the cooperation of the Central African\nRepublic in the fulfilment of his extremely difficult\n10\n\nmission, in the wake of last year\u2019s adoption by Member\nStates of the Millennium Declaration, which\nestablishes a new framework for cooperation between\nStates.\nIndeed, the Millennium Declaration must be\nviewed as a strategy within which States should work\nso as to be able meet the many challenges facing the\nworld today, which include poverty, conflict,\nintolerance, terrorism, debt, marginalization, endemic\ndisease and HIV/AIDS. These growing challenges, the\npersistence of which leads to global imbalance, can be\ndealt with only through multilateral cooperation, above\nall in the framework of the United Nations.\nSuch cooperation must first of all aim to eradicate\nthe causes of certain frustrating problems in the world,\nby, for example, achieving a just and lasting settlement\nof the question of the Middle East.\nLikewise, my delegation urges the parties\nconcerned to implement the provisions of the Lusaka\nAgreement so that the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo can regain its territorial integrity and unity and\nestablish a lasting peace, which will be of benefit to the\nCentral African Republic.\nFurthermore, States should cooperate in support\nof Africa, which is currently burdened by the weight of\nnumerous challenges. The Millennium Summit rightly\ncommitted the international community to a campaign\nfor development cooperation so as to make the right to\ndevelopment, like human rights, a reality for all.\nThe Central African Republic, which endorsed\nthe Millennium Declaration, urges the countries of the\nNorth to establish a true partnership with Africa, at\nboth the public and private level, so as to support the\ndevelopmental efforts of the continent. This will\nrequire a degree of political will, since, given the\nconflicts that are taking place today between, and often\nwithin, States, our partners sometimes give in to\ndespair and indifference when confronted with slow\nprogress, or occasionally allow themselves to be\nswayed by emotions incited by certain people who\nwish to discourage initiatives by abusively\nmanipulating ideas that promote genocide and ethnic\ncleansing \u2014 phenomena that some countries have\nrecently endured, but that can gain no foothold today in\na country such as the Central African Republic.\nWe often forget that the deep-seated sources of\nsuch conflicts are the lack of a culture of democracy in\nour societies and extreme poverty. That is why our\npartners should support our efforts to achieve\ndemocratization and contribute to consolidating the\nfoundations of our young democracies, above all by\npaying priority attention to the economic aspect,\nwhich, unfortunately, is not always the case.\nIn the case of the Central African Republic, for\nexample, on 28 May last an attempted coup took place\nwith the aim of ending the march of democracy in the\ncountry. That was the fourth such attempt in the five\nyears since 1996. We would like briefly to shed some\nlight on those events.\nAt its 4261st meeting, on 23 January 2001, the\nSecurity Council considered the situation in the Central\nAfrican Republic. While noting certain shortcomings,\nthe Council recognized the efforts of the Government\nand asked it, along with representatives of all parts of\nsociety in the Central African Republic, to continue\ndown the path towards the consolidation of democracy\nand the preservation of peace. To help in that task, the\nmandate of the United Nations Peace-building Support\nOffice in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) has\nbeen extended because, with the assistance of others, it\nis doing remarkable and productive work.\nDespite everything, the Central African Republic\nis determined to continue resolutely to be a small\nhaven of relative stability in a region torn apart by war,\nas one eminent personality put it recently. The social\nand political tension has, indeed, begun to diminish.\nSince May 2001, there has been an international\npresence.\nContrary to all expectations, the same groups that\nhave repeatedly subjected the people of the Central\nAfrican Republic to acts of terrorism for five years\ncommitted an act whose foreseeable and tragic\nconsequences are well known. When condemned by\nboth the national and international community, those\ngroups rushed to hide behind claims of genocidal\npractices in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable, thus\ncreating ethnic division in various parts of the country.\nThis recurrence of violent crises raises questions\nabout justice in our young States, which are trying to\nestablish the rule of law, but where amnesties are\ngranted in lieu of justice, allowing impunity to prevail\nand thus encouraging recidivism.\nFortunately, the world has spoken out in\ncondemnation of the most recent coup attempt, and we\n11\n\nwould like to take this opportunity, from this rostrum,\nto thank the United Nations, the European Union, the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\nCommunity of Sahel Saharan States, as well as\nbrotherly and friendly countries, which responded\nimmediately, calling for the re-establishment of\nconstitutional legality.\nAny coup, be it failed or successful, always gives\nrise to actions to undermine freedom, human rights, the\nrights of society and national rights. The Central\nAfrican Republic did not want to play that game. Thus,\na number of appropriate measures have been taken,\nincluding the creation of a joint judicial inquiry\ncommission; the establishment of contacts among the\nvarious social sectors and with the chancelleries,\norganizations and accredited institutions in the Central\nAfrican Republic at the governmental and presidential\nlevels; and diplomatic activity with the countries of the\nsubregion and the region, which are being pursued.\nHowever, beyond the attempted coup of 28 May,\nthe entire situation in the Central African Republic\nmust be assessed as a whole. Just recently, having\nrefused to present himself to the commission of judicial\ninquiry that had been established specifically to\ndetermine the consequences of the attempted coup of\n28 May, the former army Chief of Staff organized\nresistance that threatened to turn into a rebellion and\nalmost plunged the country into renewed tragedy. The\nrapid reaction of the Organization of African Unity, the\nCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States and neighbouring\nbrotherly countries has certainly helped to calm the\nsituation for the moment.\nAll these events, sorely trying to men of good\nwill, have again highlighted the question of the march\nof democracy in the Central African Republic. That\nmarch has been made even more difficult by the\nnation\u2019s extreme poverty and fragility, which, because\nof enormous financial hardships, is unable to cover the\ncosts of sovereignty, creating a veritable breeding\nground of instability. The attempted coup on 28 May\nexacerbated the country\u2019s situation by plunging it into\ntragic destitution.\nThis situation has been clearly grasped by the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU), which, on 2\nAugust, reminded its member States, for their\ninformation and possible action, of the decision on the\nsituation in the Central African Republic, adopted at\nthe seventy-fourth ordinary session of the Council of\nMinisters in Lusaka, which\n\u201cAppeals to Member States and the rest of\nthe international community to provide the\nnecessary economic and financial assistance for\nthe reconstruction of the Central African\nRepublic and in particular calls on the countries\nwhich have promised to provide funds at the\nPledging Conference in favour of the Central\nAfrican Republic in New York in May 2000 to\nhonour their commitments.\u201d (CM/Dec.602\n(LXXIV), para. 4)\nThe Central African Republic thanks the OAU for\nthat decision. We also wish here to express our\ngratitude to the Security Council, which has always\nshown great interest in the situation in our country. We\nfurther wish to make special mention here of Gabon,\nFrance and the Secretary-General of the United\nNations, as well as the friends of the Central African\nRepublic represented here, for their firm involvement\nat the side of the Central African Republic. We hope\nthat they will not despair over these repeated crises\nbecause, in spite of everything, we in the Central\nAfrican Republic are truly determined to overcome our\nproblems.\nWe therefore hope that the United Nations will\nadvocate even more energetically the cause of our\ncountry before the various international financial\ninstitutions with a view to securing greater assistance\nfor us, because the repercussions of the series of events\nthat began in 1996 will require significant financial\nresources to ensure the recovery of the country, the\ntotal collapse of which would have an impact\nthroughout our subregion, if not beyond.\nWe are called upon at this session to consider the\nmanner in which States should implement the\nMillennium Declaration through their conduct. It is\nonly through cooperation and solidarity that we can\nachieve this and thus ensure for the world the\nfulfilment of the objectives set out in the United\nNations Charter. This cooperation should also allow us\nto find the necessary means of meeting the common\nchallenge of terrorism, which is more apparent today\nthan ever before.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish warmly to\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his unanimous\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. We\nshare the conviction that he will infuse the work of the\nAssembly with dynamism and a new perspective.\nI also join in the warm tributes paid to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. We congratulate\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his staff on having\nbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. He has\nbrought honour to us all. His re-election to a second\nterm is a just tribute to his dedication, commitment and\nsheer hard work.\nThe catastrophe of 11 September has scarred us\nall deeply. It has brought irrevocable change and\ninevitable hardship. Yet it has honed and hardened a\ncommon resolve, a steely determination to confront and\ncondemn all such irrational and mindless acts of\nviolence. Bangladesh stands committed to fight against\nterrorism, in all its forms and manifestation, by\nwhoever and wherever it is committed. We believe that\nterrorism hampers peace and security and creates\npolitical chaos and economic instability around the\nworld.\nWe have therefore pledged total support for the\nconcerted efforts of the international community to\nconfront this scourge as best, as quickly and as\ncomprehensively as we can. We have initiated the\nprocess of identifying any possible administrative or\nfinancial focus or network of suspected terrorists. We\nhave not given, and will not give, any form of\nsanctuary, training or support to any kind of terrorist\ngroup or cell. We are responding to the call of the\nSecretary-General and working towards becoming a\nparty to a number of United Nations anti-terrorist\ninstruments. We already subscribe to the 1987 South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\nConvention on Suppression of Terrorism and believe\nthat it has scope for further strengthening.\nAs a member of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference (OIC), we support, and will actively\nparticipate in, efforts to reach an agreement on the\nearly completion and adoption of a comprehensive\nconvention to combat terrorism. We hope that an\ninclusive approach will be taken that will unite us all in\nour common struggle against terrorism.\nWe are aware that terrorism has no consistent\nprofile and that it has many variables reflecting the\nincreasing complexity of human society. But this much\nis certain: we know what it is not. We must emphasize\nand underscore emphatically the fact that terrorism has\nno connection to any one religion or to any particular\n41\n\nregion of the world. It is a global phenomenon and\nshould be addressed as such. We therefore welcome\nPresident Bush's statement to the General Assembly, at\nthe 44th meeting on 10 November, during which he\nquoted the sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world's\noldest Islamic institution of higher learning, as having\ndeclared that terrorism is a disease and that Islam\nprohibits killing innocent civilians.\nPrevious speakers have underlined the fact that\nthe spotlight on terrorism should not blind us to the\npursuit of other pressing objectives. Indeed, terrorism\nis but one aspect of the many negative forces that shape\nthe substance of what we call globalization, including\ndrugs, organized crime, the illicit transfer of small\narms, money-laundering, environmental degradation,\nand the new diseases that have invaded all societies.\nMany have intrinsic interlinkages, and none respect\nborders. They call for collective approaches and\nconcerted global action.\nOn the positive side, two crucial forces have\nimpelled globalization  mass consciousness of\nindividual rights and the impact of science and\ntechnology. The push for individual rights,\nhumanitarian concerns and a burgeoning new\nhumanitarian law are reflected in the worldwide sweep\nof democracy. Advances in science and technology\nhave closed the information and communications gap.\nTogether, these forces have changed the nature of our\nworld, challenged the context and meaning of\nsovereignty, and brought about a need for new and\ndynamic approaches.\nThe radical changes that came in the wake of the\nend of the cold war coincided in Bangladesh with the\noverthrow of military dictatorship in 1990 and the\nadvent of democracy. Since then, Bangladesh has held\nin succession three general elections that have been\nacclaimed by all impartial observers, both local and\nforeign, as being eminently free and fair. We have the\nunique distinction of being the only parliamentary\ndemocracy in which elections are constitutionally\ncarried out by an interim caretaker government within\na 90-day period.\nThe roots of democracy have taken hold and have\nspread far and wide. Today, despite all of Bangladesh's\nlimitations due to poverty, its people have\ndemonstrated unequivocally that they are a functioning,\nmoderate, modernizing Muslim country. The most\nrecent elections, held on 1 October 2001, had a voter\nturnout of 75 per cent of an electorate of over 70\nmillion people. What was extraordinary was the\nunprecedented number of women who freely exercised\ntheir right of franchise.\nIn an overwhelming demonstration of support, the\npeople have returned the four-party alliance led by\nPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to power, with\nmore than two-thirds majority seats in the Bangladesh\nParliament. This is an outstanding endorsement of, and\ntriumph for, democracy. It also imposes a huge burden\nof responsibility on the Government to measure up to\nthis massive mandate.\nThe Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Begum\nKhaleda Zia, has responded firmly. The new\nGovernment is committed to consolidating and\ndeveloping a sustainable structure of democracy with\nthe participation of the opposition. The primary focus\nis to restore law and order and to ensure social peace,\nharmony and justice, so as to improve our capacity to\nfight poverty, illiteracy and underdevelopment. Four\nfactors pace the economic agenda: reducing poverty,\nraising rural productivity, boosting trade and\nencouraging investment.\nIn pursuing these key factors, the Government\nwill refine its already established four-fold strategy of\n1991-1996: encouraging macroeconomic reform,\nstimulating the private sector, enhancing the quality\nand quantity of development expenditure and\nconcentrating on the quality, not quantity, of\ninvestment. There will be a cardinal push for\naggressive economic diplomacy in the wake of\nglobalization, which has called for closer interaction\nbetween domestic and foreign policy and which has\ntriggered intense competition for greater access to\nmarkets, the flow of resources and investments, the\ntransfer of technology and employment opportunities\nabroad.\nIn the pursuit of the pre-eminent objective of\nalleviating poverty, a key concern remains to place\npeople at the centre of all public policies.\nIn the field of foreign policy, a fundamental\ncharge remains that of reinforcing mutual, beneficial\nand cooperative relations with all countries and the\nconsolidation of our image abroad as a responsible,\nstable, moderate, democratic and contributing member\nof the world community.\n42\n\nOur unwavering policy is to maintain close and\nfriendly relations with our neighbours on the basis of\nequality, mutual respect, non-interference in internal\naffairs and the settlement of outstanding bilateral issues\nthrough dialogue and negotiation. It is a matter of some\ngratification that, close on the heels of the formation of\nthe new Government, special envoys of the leaders of\nboth India and Pakistan visited Bangladesh as a\ngoodwill gesture to renew and reinvigorate ties.\nIn our region, a priority objective will be to\nrevitalize the momentum and credibility of the South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\nIt is a matter of particular satisfaction that the stalled\ntwelfth SAARC Summit will now be taking place 4-6\nJanuary 2002 in Kathmandu, Nepal. It is of vital\nimportance that this first millennium summit of South\nAsian leaders forge a new vision for the future of the\nregion that will encompass promotion of not only its\nsocio-economic mandate, but also the reduction of\ntension, the normalization of relations and the creation\nof a broader-based climate of confidence-building.\nBangladesh believes that the most compelling\nsecurity challenge facing South Asia is promoting\nsustainable growth, reform and development.\nNuclearization in South Asia has, if anything, enhanced\nsecurity concerns in the region. Bangladesh adheres to\nthe belief that security goes beyond the weapons a\nnation possesses and extends to raising living standards\nand building stable and healthy democracies. The link\nbetween development and security is thus crucial in\nSouth Asia. This was the underlying rationale of\nSAARC. The guiding motivation  as enunciated by\nthe late President Ziaur Rahman  was to visibly\nimprove the quality of life of the common people in an\nenvironment of peace.\nIn the global context, a cardinal priority for\nBangladesh will be to play an active role through\nconcrete initiatives in all socio-economic forums, to\npromote the cause of developing countries as a whole\nand the least developed in particular and, especially, to\nkeep alive special treatment for the poorest of the poor.\nA fundamental objective for Bangladesh\nconsistent with our Constitution is to strengthen the\nrole of the United Nations as the central organ for the\ncooperative management of the world's problems.\nBangladesh will continue to actively contribute to the\npeaceful settlement of disputes, to bolster collective\nsecurity and peace-building. Our commitment to\npeacekeeping remains firm and has manifested itself in\nthe participation of Bangladeshi military and civilian\ncontingents in many areas of simultaneous conflicts.\nWe are immensely proud to be currently the largest\ncontributor among blue helmets, serving in ten United\nNations missions. In the field of peacekeeping, we\nbelieve that the recommendations of the Brahimi Panel\nprovide a good basis, and we feel that the Department\nof Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) should be\nequipped adequately to handle such a requirement.\nBangladesh strongly believes that the issue of\nrepresentation of troop-contributing countries in the\nmilitary, civilian police and diplomatic components in\nthe DPKO and in other departments, as well as in the\nmission headquarters, should be seriously considered in\nthe context of the proposed expansion scheme.\nBangladesh's term in the Security Council is now\nabout to come to an end. We have sought to live up to\nour responsibility with pragmatism and moderation. We\nhave tried to make the work of the Council more\ntransparent, open and proactive and to develop an\neffective interface between the Council and the general\nmembership to reflect the aspirations of all on issues of\ncommon interest.\nToday, certain issues both political and economic\nhave assumed centre stage, and our attention is\ntelescoped upon them. Prime among them is the\nsituation in Afghanistan. Bangladesh is a part of the\ninternational coalition that seeks to establish a stable,\ndurable, social, political and economic structure in\nAfghanistan as soon as possible. It is our hope that the\nAfghan people will have a true opportunity to choose\ntheir own system of governance in line with human\nvalues and democratic practices in a post-Taliban\ndispensation. Such a Government should be broad-\nbased, multi-ethnic, demographically and equitably\nrepresentative, responsive to the needs of the Afghan\npeople and acceptable to the people of Afghanistan, the\nneighbourhood and the international community. We\nwelcome efforts to focus on positive and finite\nsolutions to the problems of Afghanistan, especially\nefforts being made with the assistance of the United\nNations for forming an interim transitional Government\nacceptable to the Afghan people. We also welcome two\nkey projects: first, a massive reconstruction and\nrehabilitation plan and efforts to mobilize funding;\nsecond, a hard focus on ways and means to facilitate\nthe return of the refugees. Of immediate importance is\nthe vast humanitarian tragedy in Afghanistan, the need\n43\n\nto contain and minimize the loss of human life and to\nreach out with immediate relief to refugees and\ndisplaced persons.\nWhile new threats to peace, security and\neconomic stability are emerging, the old ones remain.\nOccupation, inter-State and intra-State conflicts,\nparticularly in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans,\ncontinue to threaten regional and global peace and\nstability. We are particularly concerned at the steady\ndeterioration of the situation in Palestine, arising out of\nthe encroachment on Palestinian territories and the\ncollective punishment meted out to the Palestinians.\nBangladesh will continue to maintain its unflinching\nsupport of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople to an early establishment of a State of their own\nwith Jerusalem as its capital.\nPoverty today remains the pre-eminent moral\nand humanitarian challenge of our age and hence\nneeds to be tackled with due priority. The Secretary-\nGeneral has reminded us of the commitments made by\nour leaders during the Millennium Summit last year to\neradicate this scourge.\nThe role of external financial support in the\ndevelopment process has assumed greater importance\nby virtue of the fact that better education, knowledge,\nskill and awareness must be effectively integrated into\nthe global economic and market mechanism. In this\ncontext, we look forward to the Monterrey\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment in March 2002.\nOver the last few decades, access to global\nmarkets has been seriously limited for the products of\nthe developing countries in general and the least\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) in particular. In this\ncontext, Bangladesh calls upon development partners\nto create more access for trade, including offering\nduty-free, quota-free access to products from the LDCs\non a secure, long-term and predictable basis with\nrealistic and flexible rules of origin to match the\nindustrial capacity of the LDCs. We are hopeful that\nthe current Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\nOrganization in Doha will be able to effectively focus\non the obligations to implement the commitments made\nearlier during the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Debt\nrepayment is also an enormous burden on the\ndeveloping countries, particularly on the LDCs. We\nurge the developed countries to expand the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) facility to include\nmore indebted developing countries, with particular\nfocus on the LDCs.\nBangladesh is committed to strengthening and to\nfollowing up on many ideas to bolster the United\nNations capacity to lead, especially that of the General\nAssembly. Bangladesh strongly supports the idea of\nforging better coordination between the major organs\nof the United Nations, namely the General Assembly,\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council,\nfor working out a long-term strategy for sustainable\npeace and development.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that it is not the\nlack of resources that prevents the promotion of a\ncollective and shared perspective on common\nchallenges. What we perhaps need is to muster the\ndetermination and courage to build up a collective and\ninclusive approach for undertaking pragmatic and\nforward-looking actions. The challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century remind us once again that we must seek\nharmony through diversity, peace through dialogue,\nand prosperity through mutual cooperation. The United\nNations offers the most appropriate and central\nmechanism to promote our best aspirations and\nobjectives. The journey to peace has always been\narduous; nonetheless, it is the longing for peace,\nprogress and justice that has inspired us to work for our\nbetter tomorrow.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\nsession of the General Assembly is facing the very\nimportant task of comparing and coordinating the\npositions of the members of the international\ncommunity on the most urgent issues of our time, that\nis, ensuring strategic stability and equal security for all\nStates, strengthening the coordinating role of the\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\npeace and security and the settlement of regional\nconflict, fighting poverty and disease, and creating\nconditions for sustainable development and prosperity\nof all peoples on our planet. It is clear that the search\nfor a collective response to the unprecedented\nchallenge thrown down to mankind by international\nterrorism on 11 September has become a key subject of\nthis session.\nThe twentieth century proved convincingly that\nthe United Nations has indeed become the centre for\nharmonizing the actions of nations in maintaining\n36\n\npeace, ensuring collective security, developing\ninternational cooperation, and ensuring respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Thanks to the\njoint efforts of its Member States, the Organization has,\nin 55 years, become a universal forum capable of\ndeveloping joint political approaches of the community\nof nations towards resolving the most urgent and\ncomplicated problems of world development. The role\nof the United Nations as the most representative\ninternational forum for discussing the whole range of\nproblems faced by mankind, and developing\napproaches for international cooperation in dealing\nwith such problems, is becoming more significant with\neach passing year. In the view of the President of\nTajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, the task of\nstrengthening the central role of the United Nations has\nbecome more rather than less urgent.\nDuring the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly the Republic of Tajikistan will be celebrating\nthe tenth anniversary of its United Nations\nmembership. Since the first day of its international\nrecognition, Tajikistan has been working closely with\nthe United Nations. Cooperation with the United\nNations in the first years of its independence helped\nTajikistan to stop civil strife, to find an effective\nformula for peace and national accord and now to start\npost-conflict peace-building.\nWe will never forget that dramatic period and the\nselfless assistance and support that we were given by\nMember States, the Security Council, and specialized\nagencies. Our special gratitude goes to the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose contribution to the\nsettlement of the inter-Tajik conflict deserves the\ngreatest appreciation. We believe that the Nobel Peace\nPrize awarded to the United Nations also reflects the\nsuccess achieved under its leadership by the\ninternational community in the peaceful settlement of\nthe internal conflict in Tajikistan and in overcoming its\nconsequences. We are convinced that the unique\nexperience of peacemaking in Tajikistan deserves in-\ndepth consideration and study. Practical lessons learned\nfrom the settlement of the inter-Tajik conflict and the\nUnited Nations peacemaking activities will enable the\ninternational community to find new approaches\ntowards resolving conflicts in other hot spots on the\nplanet.\nThe variety of problems dealt with by the United\nNations highlights the unique and universal role played\nby the Organization in regulating international affairs.\nThat is particularly important in the field of\ninternational security. The Republic of Tajikistan calls\nfor ensuring strategic stability in the world based on\nmaintaining the existing system of agreements and\ntreaties on disarmament and a continuing process of\narms limitation, on both a unilateral and multilateral\nbasis. Tajikistan, for its part, is prepared to make its\ncontribution to this process. In cooperation with our\nneighbouring States, we are actively working to\nimplement the initiative of establishing a nuclear-free\nzone in Central Asia. We hope that a treaty to this\neffect will shortly be ready for signing by the heads of\nState in our region, and expect that all nuclear Powers\nwill become its guarantors.\nThe appalling acts of terror perpetrated in the\nUnited States on 11 September forced the whole world\nto confront the issue of international terrorism and take\na fresh look at it. In order to solve this problem, it will\nbe necessary to analyse the whole set of new\nchallenges and threats and develop new approaches\ntowards creating a credible and effective system for\ncountering them. May I remind Member States that, on\nbehalf of the people of Tajikistan, immediately after\nthe terrorist acts, President Emomali Rakhmonov\nconveyed sincere condolences and sympathy to the\nfamilies of all those who had died or suffered. He\nexpressed full solidarity with the people of the United\nStates and readiness to cooperate closely with their\nGovernment and the Governments of other States in\neradicating international terrorism.\nTajikistan has always condemned terrorism in all\nits manifestations and categorically rejects the use of\nterrorist acts as a means of achieving political or other\ngoals. We reject any attempts to justify acts of terror on\npolitical, religious, philosophical, ethnic or racial\ngrounds. International cooperation in combating\nterrorism and extremism is not an abstract notion for\nour country. The Tajik people are very well aware of\nthe methods and practices of international terrorism. In\nrecent years, Tajikistan has repeatedly been a target of\nterrorist activities carried out from outside. In addition\nto the huge material losses, such actions always entail\nloss of life and enormous human suffering. What is\nworse, terrorism attempts not only to derail the peace\nprocess in Tajikistan, but also to destabilize the\nsituation over a vast region of Asia. Acts of\n37\n\ninternational terrorism constitute a grave threat to\ninternational peace and security. In combating\nterrorism in any part of our planet, the international\ncommunity should be guided by similar criteria and act\nin a resolute, sincere and, most important, consistent\nmanner. All States must unconditionally and fully\nimplement the provisions of United Nations Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), including those which\ncall for depriving terrorists and their sponsors of\nfinancial or any other support and haven.\nWe believe that one of the primary objectives of\nthis session of the General Assembly is to consolidate\nthe legal framework, under United Nations auspices,\nfor the interaction of States in combating international\nterrorism. In our view, the early adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention on combating international\nterrorism and the convention on combating acts of\nnuclear terrorism could be of great significance in this\nregard. On various occasions, in particular from this\nrostrum, the President of Tajikistan has called for\nuniting the efforts of the community of nations to\ncombat the international terrorist underground. Our\ncountry has interacted effectively with other States in\ncombating international terrorism on a bilateral and\nmultilateral basis, in particular within the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the\nShanghai Cooperation Organization and other\ninternational organizations. The United Nations, with\nits unprecedented experience and authority in\ncoordinating the efforts of its Member States, is called\nupon to play the key role in establishing a global\nsystem to counteract a threat of such magnitude as\ninternational terrorism. It will take much effort and\ntime. However, the lofty and vitally important goal of\neradicating this dreadful phenomenon is worthy of such\nendeavour.\nThe five weeks that have elapsed since the\nbeginning of the military operation in Afghanistan have\nproved that the Afghan problem cannot be resolved by\nmeans of force alone. There is simply no military\nsolution to it, and history has provided convincing\nproof of that. At the high-level meeting yesterday of\nthe Six plus Two Group, and today at the meeting of\nthe Security Council on Afghanistan, the delegation of\nTajikistan emphasized that under current circumstances\nthe Afghan people have a unique opportunity to return\nto peaceful and stable development. This is an\nopportunity for Afghanistan to become a full-fledged\nmember of the international community and to change\nits unfortunate image of an accomplice in international\nterrorism and other criminal, destructive, destabilizing\nmovements. The Afghan nation is on the threshold of\nfundamental change. The most crucial task, and I\nwould say a matter of honour for the international\ncommunity, is to help the Afghan people to take\nadvantage of this opportunity. Everything must be done\nto make sure that in the future Afghanistan is no longer\na threat to the Afghans themselves, to neighbouring\ncountries and to international security overall.\nEverything must be done in order to ensure respect for\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in\nAfghanistan, including putting an end to the shameful\ndiscrimination against women and girls. Everything\nmust be done to restore to the Afghan people hope for a\npeaceful future and prosperity. Tajikistan is prepared,\nin cooperation with other concerned States, and with a\ncentral coordinating role for the United Nations, to\nassist Afghanistan, a country with a great history, to\nregain a worthy future and to restore its former\nattractive image in the eyes of the international\ncommunity. We believe that determining the future of\nAfghanistan is the exclusive prerogative of the Afghan\npeople themselves. One of the indispensable conditions\nfor returning Afghanistan to a peaceful life is ending\noutside interference and uniting, under United Nations\nauspices, the efforts of the international community to\naccelerate the process of political settlement of the\nAfghan problem and the rehabilitation of the country.\nFurthermore, it is essential that all hotbeds of\nterrorism, elements of organized crime and the\nstructures and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 the production\npotential of the drug business be eliminated in\nAfghanistan.\nIt goes without saying that the territorial integrity\nof Afghanistan must be guaranteed. Only the\nestablishment of a freely chosen, effective, broad-\nbased, politically balanced and multi-ethnic Afghan\nadministration can guarantee peace and stability in the\ncountry. It also goes without saying that the Taliban\nmovement as a political group has no place in a future\nAfghan administration since this could be fraught with\nthe danger of the recurrence of terrorism and the drug\ntrade in Afghanistan.\nWe are profoundly concerned about the grave\nhumanitarian situation in Afghanistan. The refusal of\nthe Taliban regime to fulfil the demands of the anti-\nterrorist coalition to hand over the masterminds and\norganizers of the acts of terror in the United States has\n38\n\nresulted in new sufferings for the Afghan people and an\nincrease in the numbers of refugees and displaced\npersons. According to the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, among the 22\nmillion refugees throughout the world, at least one out\nof six is an Afghan. According to the estimates of the\nhumanitarian organizations, the drought that has\ncontinued for three years in Afghanistan has already\nresulted in the incredible impoverishment of the entire\npopulation, and military operations and the\napproaching winter have placed millions of Afghan\npeople on the edge of extinction. The actual reality is\nsuch that the coming winter threatens millions of\nAfghans with death from starvation. Right after the\nbeginning of the United States anti-terrorist operation\nin Afghanistan, the Tajikistan Government issued a\nspecial decision expressing its readiness to open its\nairspace and related infrastructure for providing\nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan\nwho have been suffering from the Taliban tyranny for a\nlong time. We call upon all Member States and\nhumanitarian institutions and organizations to give all\nthe necessary assistance to the people of Afghanistan\nwithout delay. If that is not done, then Afghanistan will\nbecome the scene of a horrendous humanitarian\ntragedy. It could cause a wave of instability in\nneighbouring States and in the region as a whole. We\ncannot allow that to happen.\nThe policy of drug production and export pursued\nby the Taliban regime can be described as a policy\nagainst humanity. It is sad that Afghanistan, one of the\nfounding Members of the United Nations and one of\nthe cradles of world civilization and culture, has now,\nthrough the fault of the Taliban regime, become one of\nthe world\u2019s largest producers of lethal drugs.\nAccording to the United Nations Office for Drug\nControl and Crime Prevention, the considerable\ndecrease in the poppy crop in Afghanistan this year has\nnot resulted in a reduction of illicit heroin trafficking,\neither to neighbouring countries or to Europe. Huge\namounts of raw opium stored in the Taliban-controlled\nterritory were used for heroin trafficking. The quantity\nof heroin that has been destroyed in Tajikistan this year\nalone is three times as much as last year, and this\namounts to tons of this deadly product.\nAs a result of the tragic events of 11 September, a\nnew situation has emerged in Afghanistan. The United\nNations has been unable to continue assistance to the\nAfghan farmers and exercise control over drug\nproduction and trade. The Taliban movement, for\nwhom, under the current circumstances, drug\ntrafficking has become one of its major sources of\nincome, took advantage of this situation. That has put\nan additional burden on neighbouring countries, such\nas Tajikistan, that are trying to block drug trafficking\nfrom Afghanistan. We understand that the drug threat\nemanating from Afghanistan can be eliminated only\nthrough a lasting peace settlement in the country and\nby establishing a new coalition government that would\nensure fulfilment of all its international commitments.\nHowever, that will take time. For this reason we\nexpress our gratitude to the Office for Drug Control\nand Crime Prevention and to all donor States that are\nfunding the anti-drug programmes implemented by the\nOffice, and call upon them to increase their assistance\nto Tajikistan in its noble struggle against illicit flows of\ndeadly substances from Afghanistan, a struggle that\nserves the interests of millions of people in various\ncountries. We in Tajikistan attach great importance to\nthis struggle and view it as an important contribution to\ncombating international terrorism by depriving it of\none of the main sources of its financial support.\nThe Millennium Summit and Millennium\nAssembly, which have become milestones in the\ninternational dialogue, identified globalization as the\nmain challenge to the international community. There\nis no doubt that globalization, which is an objective\neconomic process, provides unprecedented\nopportunities for accelerated development. At the same\ntime, it is obvious that the benefits of globalization are\ndistributed quite unequally, and the balance of benefits\nand costs is definitely in favour of the developed\nnations. The conclusion is obvious: for various reasons\nmany developing countries and economies in transition\nrun the serious risk of finding themselves on the\nsidelines, away from the mainstream development of\ncivilization. Only by applying all available mechanisms\nof multilateral international institutions can we stop the\nwidening gap in development and incomes between\nrich and poor countries that was caused by\nglobalization, and prevent an increase in poverty,\nunequal access to advanced technologies, cross-border\ncrime and the spread of hidden forms of discrimination\nin international trade.\nAs for Tajikistan, it faces the long-term problem\nof rebuilding a country that has been heavily damaged\nby civil strife. The Government is undertaking all\npossible measures to strengthen civil society, to\n39\n\nencourage economic recovery and to create favourable\nconditions for healthy and sustainable social and\neconomic development. We hope that the participants\nin the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan, held\nin Tokyo in May 2001, will fulfil their commitments to\nTajikistan, which would enable us to channel additional\nresources to rehabilitation projects. That would\nincrease employment and substantially reduce poverty.\nThe problem of combating poverty will remain, in the\nshort term, one of the priority tasks for the Government\nof Tajikistan. The targeted comprehensive programme\nthat is currently being implemented in the country\nenvisages, in particular, measures to create new jobs, to\nimprove primary education, to ease access to loans and\nmicrocredits, and, what is particularly important, to\nenhance the development of rural regions. We are\ncarefully studying the experience of other countries in\ncombating poverty. The progress made by some\nStates \u2014 in particular in China, our neighbour \u2014 is\nquite encouraging. However, the high level of external\nindebtedness of Tajikistan is a major obstacle in this\nregard. It also impedes post-conflict peace-building\nand poses a serious threat to social and economic\nstability in our country. We are convinced that in order\nto support the developing countries and economies in\ntransition in combating poverty it is important for the\ninternational community to become more dynamic and\nflexible in easing the debt burden for our countries.\nIn recent years we have witnessed an increasing\nnumber of major natural and industrial disasters,\nincluding hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and forest\nfires. Human casualties and material losses caused by\nthem have become a serious destabilizing factor. For\ntwo years running, Tajikistan has suffered as a result of\na large-scale drought, unprecedented in the twentieth\ncentury. One third of our cotton and grain crops was\ndestroyed by drought. Cattle farming and animal\nhusbandry products have sharply declined. Shortages\nof water, including fresh water, have increased. We\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General, to the\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and donor\ncountries for their prompt and generous response to the\nappeal made by our President in connection with the\nunprecedented drought in the spring and summer of\nthis year. The concerted collective response of the\ninternational community to natural disasters is\nevidence of the increasing effectiveness of the\navailable international machinery in this regard. The\nUnited Nations has played an important role in\ndeveloping them. The outcome of the United Nations\nInternational Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction\nhas shown the need to increasingly use national\nopportunities and to enhance international cooperation\nin this field.\nIn the context of globalization, natural and\nindustrial disasters demand an appropriate global\nresponse. It is essential that the community of nations\nunite its efforts to prevent natural disasters and deal\nwith their consequences by training personnel and\nexchanging experience and the results of scientific and\napplied research. That would also allow coordinated\napproaches to such global challenges as the greenhouse\neffect, the depletion of the ozone layer, endangered\nbiodiversity and desertification. All these issues are\ndirectly linked to the problem of protecting the\nenvironment, a problem that is global by its very\nnature.\nAmong the environmental challenges of the\ntwenty-first century, the problem of maintaining water\nequilibrium and access to fresh water is one of the most\nurgent. The population of earth is increasing, and the\nneed for fresh water is also increasing, while natural\nwater resources are not increasing. One out of six\npeople on earth does not have access to fresh water\ntoday. The danger of the world\u2019s diminishing fresh\nwater resources is quite evident: it represents a threat\nto the environment and to all life on earth. This\ntendency is not becoming less acute, and therefore\nTajikistan, which possesses considerable water\nresources in Central Asia, greatly appreciates all efforts\nto deal with the problem of fresh water resources at all\nlevels throughout the world. We are pleased that the\ninitiative of the President of Tajikistan, Emomali\nRakhmonov, to proclaim 2003 the international year of\nfresh water has received wide-ranging support in the\ncommunity of nations. We believe that the preparation\nand holding of events dedicated to the international\nyear of fresh water, at both international and national\nlevels, will help us all to find answers to the global\nchallenges faced by mankind and to come closer to a\nsolution to the strategic problem of providing access to\nfresh water to every person on earth.\nWith the beginning of the new century, the\nnumber of problems faced by mankind has not\ndiminished. The entire history of the United Nations\nhas demonstrated that the best way to deal with\nproblems is through collective action, based on an\nagreed platform. We have such a platform: the\nMillennium Declaration adopted by our heads of State,\n40\n\non a basis of global consensus, in the autumn of 2000.\nThe task that lies before us, the United Nations, is to\nmobilize energy and resources to achieve our common\ngoals in meeting the challenges of globalization. The\npeoples of our planet believe in the effectiveness of our\nOrganization. We should not fail to meet their hopes\nand expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAntigua and\nBarbuda is pleased that this is the United Nations Year\nof Dialogue among Civilizations. However, we can\nhave meaningful dialogue only if the dominant\ncountries reach out with genuine understanding when\nothers speak. We can have dialogue only if the basic\nprinciples of the United Nations are made the core of\nreality. We cannot have dialogue if multilateralism\nremains selective or if the principle of rotation\ncontinues to be based on demographics, military might\nand economic principles. The people of my country\nrepresent an integral part of human civilization and we\nwish to contribute our voice and our ideas to the debate\non the future of the journey of humankind on this\nplanet.\n28\n\nThe tragic events of 11 September in the host\ncountry of the United Nations have presented a\nchallenge to world civilization. The Parliament of\nAntigua and Barbuda on Thursday, 18 October, passed\nstrong anti-terrorism legislation. Also, the Caribbean\nCommunity, meeting in special emergency session in\nthe Bahamas on 11 and 12 October, recognized\nterrorism as a global problem requiring a resolute\nglobal response. The heads of Government stated:\n\u201cWe are conscious that the unprecedented\nand barbaric terrorist assaults of 11 September\nwill require of us extraordinary vigilance and\ncoordination in the future, to ensure that our\nterritories, our institutions and our citizens are\nnot used in any manner to facilitate the activities\nof terrorists or to undermine our national and\nregional security.\u201d\nWe share the agony of the United States, for we\ntoo had nationals who perished in the 11 September\natrocity. We fully support Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), which makes it obligatory for all States to\nimpose far-reaching measures to combat the scourge of\nterrorism. We support the work of the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee. International terrorism is in\nreality an act of war against the world\u2019s peace-loving\npeoples. It is imperative that all countries of the world\naddress in a more meaningful manner the underlying\nsocial, economic and political problems that cause\nhuman misery and perpetuate injustice. We must act to\nensure that the entire global society lives in an\nenvironment of freedom and is free from fear. The fight\nagainst terrorism will be a long and arduous one, but it\nis one in which we must thoroughly and completely\nengage ourselves.\nAntigua and Barbuda has now ratified the Rome\nStatute for the International Criminal Court. The\ncitizens of my country believe that in the prospect of an\ninternational criminal court lies the promise of\nuniversal justice, since the Court will have the power to\nindict individuals. Antigua and Barbuda is certainly\ndisappointed that crimes pertaining to drug trafficking\nand terrorism have been put on the back burner at the\nInternational Criminal Court, but we are prepared to\ncontinue our dialogue to bring them under the ambit of\nthe Court when it becomes active. The cancer of drug\ntrafficking will continue to threaten human civilization\nuntil we fashion a truly global response to its menace.\nThe battles in Seattle, Windsor and Quebec are an\nintegral part of world civilization\u2019s struggle to\nhumanize globalization. Interestingly, we find\nourselves agreeing with the statement made by the\nManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF) in his address to members of the Deutsche\nBundestag on 2 April 2001 in Berlin. Mr. K\u00f6hler\ndeclared that it is political and economic madness for\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries to spend $360 billion a\nyear on agricultural subsidies, while poverty rages in\ndeveloping countries, especially in the rural and\nfarming regions. He went on to say that it is high time\nfor industrial countries to honour their commitment to\nprovide 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for\nofficial development assistance.\nAt the United Nations Millennium Summit, my\nown Prime Minister, Lester Bird, castigated the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment for its unilaterally devised set of\nstandards for international taxation to be imposed on\nother jurisdictions and for demanding that States\nchange their domestic laws to suit OECD purposes.\nThe rule of law has become the rule of the jungle,\nwhere rules do not apply, and only might is right. In\nreality, the OECD Harmful Tax Competition project\nhas nothing to do with money laundering, but has more\nto do with the fact that OECD believes that its member\nStates would lose capital to other States with more\ncompetitive tax regimes.\nGlobalization has left States like my own with a\nfeeling of exclusion, a feeling of being cast aside and\npushed outside, from where we observe the gains of the\ndominant. It is a feeling of not being able to participate\nin the determination of our own destiny. The \u201cgreen\nroom\u201d process evident at World Trade Organization\n(WTO) ministerial meetings has done nothing but\nincrease our apprehension. We call for serious reform\nof the global political and economic architecture to be\nundertaken, both at the United Nations and at the\nWorld Trade Organization. The multilateral trading\nsystem needs to be transparent. It needs to be fair and\nequitable, and all countries should be able to share in\nits benefits.\nAntigua and Barbuda, as a small island State, is\nextremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The most\nprevalent threat is that of hurricanes, three of which\nrecently impacted our sister States of Belize, Cuba and\nthe Bahamas. A single hurricane can set back the\n29\n\ndevelopment of a small island State by 10 years.\nBetween 1995 and 2000, our beloved twin island State\nwas hit by seven hurricanes.\nWe call on the international community to\nacknowledge in a meaningful way the vulnerability of\nsmall States like Antigua and Barbuda. We point to our\nlack of capacity in financial and human resources to\nbounce back from natural disasters and from external\nshocks to its economy caused by economic recession in\nthe major economies of the world, which also happen\nto be our main trading partners. It is therefore\nimperative that we be able to continue to access\nconcessionary financing through the World Bank. Our\nsocial and economic development needs, including\ninfrastructure, seem not to register in the boardrooms\nof the international financial institutions.\nCountries like Antigua and Barbuda are viewed\nas middle income because of the per capita income\ncriterion, but this is a flawed measurement and should\nbe abandoned. Financing for development should take\ninto account a mix of factors and should be linked to\nthe vulnerability index on which the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has\ndone important work.\nNo account is taken of the considerable\ntransaction costs faced by small States because of their\nremoteness and the disproportionate burden they bear\nin order to effectively participate in world trade. No\naccount is taken of the openness of our economy to\ngoods and services from all over the world, without\ncorresponding market access for our own limited range\nof goods to the markets of Europe and North America.\nAn inhospitable stranger known as \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d\ncontinues to slam the door in our face.\nIn these circumstances, we cannot overemphasize\nhow important it is for the IMF and the World Bank to\napply special and differential treatment to measuring\nthe fiscal and economic performance of small island\nStates. Our limited capacity to raise revenue and our\nnecessity to spend at a disproportionate level in order\nto maintain a decent standard of living for our people\nshould lead the IMF to have special and differential\nprogrammes of assistance for small island States.\nThese programmes should not merely prescribe the\ntraditional formula of large-scale public sector\ndismissals and reduction of public sector investment\nprogrammes. Instead, innovative ways should be found\nto provide long-term financing at repayment periods\nand rates of interest that would allow small States to\nmaintain democracy, human rights, low crime rates and\neconomic growth.\nMy country welcomes the successful conclusion\nof the Marrakesh meeting on climate change, where the\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change finalized the operational details of\nthe Kyoto Protocol, thereby opening the way to\nwidespread ratification by Governments and the\nProtocol\u2019s early entry into force. This was the result of\nseveral years of tough negotiation in which Antigua\nand Barbuda was very active and took a leadership\nposition. What we now have in place are the\ninstitutions and detailed procedures of the Kyoto\nProtocol, and the next step is to test their effectiveness\nin overseeing the five per cent cut in greenhouse gas\nemissions by developed countries over the next decade.\nThe agreements reached in Marrakesh also made\nimportant progress on strengthening the flow of\nfinancial and technological support to developing\ncountries so that they can move towards a sustainable\nenergy future. They also send a clear signal to\nbusiness, local governments and the general public that\nclimate-friendly products, services and activities will\nbe rewarded by consumers and national policies alike.\nThe meeting also adopted the Marrakesh\nMinisterial Declaration as an input into next\nSeptember\u2019s World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg. The\nDeclaration emphasizes the contribution that action on\nclimate change can make to sustainable development\nand calls for capacity building, technology innovation\nand cooperation with the Biodiversity and\nDesertification Conventions. With the Summit a little\nless than a year away, small island developing States\nsuch as my own, which are among the most vulnerable\nto the adverse effects of climate change, continue to\nurge the speedy ratification of the Protocol.\nThat will require a global coalition among States\nto ensure that it enters into force and becomes legally\nbinding after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties\nto the Convention, including the industrialized\ncountries that represent at least 55 per cent of the total\n1990 carbon dioxide emissions from this group. While\nit remains true that those with the highest per capita\nlevels of greenhouse gas emissions should take the\nlead, it is incumbent upon all countries to work\n30\n\ntogether to ensure that there is full compliance with\ncommitments contained in the Protocol.\nThere is a deep concern in our countries, a\nconcern that takes on paramount proportions and that is\ncentred around the transhipment of nuclear waste\nthrough the waters of the Caribbean Sea, and which\nrepresents a blatant disregard of our sovereignty. The\ncountries of the Caribbean have insisted that it be\nstopped, but to no avail; and our populations live in\nconstant fear of an accident. We call on those who\nengage in this deadly traffic to respect the rights of\ntransit States such as Antigua and Barbuda.\nThe most populous democracy in the world,\nIndia, spoke on the first day of the general debate and\nhighlighted concerns that we find it necessary to\nreiterate. There needs to be a more determined\nmovement towards the liquidation of the external debts\nof low income and highly indebted countries. There\nshould be poverty alleviation programmes designed for\ncountries facing financial crises, and there should be\nstabilization of international prices of primary\ncommodity exports.\nThe measures that we have outlined here are\nessential to building a just and equitable international\norder. Anything less would simply be the imposition of\nthe will of the powerful upon the pusillanimous. All\nsocieties are measured by the way they treat their most\nvulnerable members, and the international community\nof nations is no different. I call on all representatives\nhere assembled to heed the plea of the victims and to\nconstruct an international order that can lift human\ncivilization to achieve the highest ideals of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset,\nlet me express my sincere felicitations and those of my\nGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands, on\nyour election, Sir, as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. As you know, the\nRepublic of Korea and Solomon Islands enjoy very\nwarm and cordial relations. My delegation is therefore\ndelighted to see you presiding over this Assembly. Our\ngratitude also goes to your predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri, for the efficient manner in which he conducted\nthe work of the previous session. I also congratulate the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his well-\ndeserved reappointment for another term in office, and\non the award, to him and to the United Nations, of the\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe horrendous terrorist attack on the United\nStates on 11 September was an attack against humanity.\nWhat we witnessed on that day was unimaginable. It\nbrought pain and loss on an inconceivable scale; there\ncan be no justification for it. This morning I visited\nground zero to pay my respects to the thousands of\ninnocent people buried there and to reaffirm the\nsolidarity of Solomon Islands with the Government and\nthe people of the United States of America.\nTerrorism is an evil phenomenon which must be\neradicated. Individuals and organizations perpetrating\nsuch evil must be brought to justice. Similarly, States\nthat harbour or provide safe haven for terrorist\nactivities must play their full part in eradicating this\nmenace.\nThe war against international terrorism must aim\nto have far-reaching solutions, rather than be merely\nreactive. Effective international cooperation is critical\nto the global implementation of anti-terrorism\nmeasures, in order to deny terrorists any weak spots\nthat they could exploit to launch their criminal\noperations. Solomon Islands is taking steps towards the\nratification of the various international conventions\nagainst terrorism. Countries such as mine need\ntechnical support in law enforcement, surveillance and\ninformation-sharing so as to effectively implement\nthese instruments. In this regard, I welcome President\nBush\u2019s offer to help countries that need assistance in\n2\n\nstrengthening and implementing anti-terrorism\nstrategies.\nWhile the war against terrorism is a matter of\nurgency, the United Nations should not underestimate\nthe continuing need to address other global issues that\nalso threaten human security. Persistent poverty and\nunderdevelopment; environmental degradation; internal\nconflict and war; the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction, as well as of small arms and light\nweapons; trade in illicit drugs; the deadly spread of\nHIV/AIDS; and violations of human rights are all\ncomplex global problems that continue to demand\nconcerted global responses.\nWith their limited resources and capacity, small\nisland developing States like Solomon Islands are\nunable to cope with the magnitude of these problems.\nPost-cold-war security now rightly embraces human,\nenvironmental, economic and political dimensions.\nThe inter-ethnic crisis that the Solomon Islands\nexperienced between 1998 and 2000, and its\ndevastating impact on the country, is a sobering\nreminder that peace and development are intrinsically\nlinked. One cannot be achieved if the other fails. In\nmost situations, including in our case, peace takes\nprecedence, as no rebuilding is possible without\nsecurity and stability. My Government has worked\nresolutely to bring the warring factions to the table.\nOur efforts culminated in the signing of the Townsville\nPeace Agreement in October 2000 and of the Marau\nPeace Agreement earlier this year.\nThe Townsville Agreement led to the cessation of\nthe conflict. However, progress in the implementation\nof the Agreement\u2019s disarmament provisions has been\nslow. With a considerable number of high-powered\nweapons still to be handed in, the peace process\nremains fragile. A review of the Agreement was begun\nrecently, but it has been temporarily suspended. We are\nconfident that the review process will soon resume in\norder to positively consolidate the ongoing peace\nprocess.\nAt this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the\ncontributions of our development partners towards the\npeace process, in particular the Governments of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand\nand the countries of the European Union. My\nGovernment is also grateful to civil society institutions,\nincluding the churches and non-governmental\norganizations, for their efforts, especially at the height\nof the crisis.\nThe challenge is far from over. With a shattered\neconomy and a delicate peace process, the task of\nrebuilding the country and ensuring lasting peace is\nformidable. It requires the patience, cooperation and\ncommitment of all Solomon Islanders. My Government\nhas adopted a National Peace Plan and Programme of\nAction aimed at addressing the root causes of the\nconflict through meaningful dialogue and discussion\nand by encouraging a more participatory approach in\nthe country\u2019s socio-economic and political\ndevelopment. The recent ruling by our judiciary\naffirming the constitutional legitimacy of my\nGovernment has given us additional resolve to\nimplement this Plan and Programme of Action. In this\nconnection, the understanding and support of the\ninternational community, in particular our development\npartners, is important.\nDevelopment cooperation should strive to reduce\nthe vulnerability of societies to violent conflicts. Aid\nshould go beyond immediate humanitarian needs. It has\nto be linked to peace-building initiatives in order to\nmake peace sustainable. Development assistance could,\ntherefore, be a means of conflict prevention and an\ninstrument for peace-building.\nThere is a clear imperative to address the poverty\nand inequality that exist among our countries. But there\nis also an irrefutable common interest for doing so, as\nmany of today\u2019s problems \u2014 especially in the least\ndeveloped countries \u2014 are rooted in underdevelopment\nand poverty. The timely implementation of the\noutcomes of the Third United Nations Conference on\nthe Least Developed Countries is therefore imperative.\nWe are fully aware that primary responsibility to put in\nplace the necessary reforms for poverty reduction and\neconomic growth lies with the least developed\ncountries. Education, infrastructure development and\nimproving basic health services remain priority issues\nfor Solomon Islands.\nUndoubtedly, investment of overseas\ndevelopment assistance resources to support our efforts\ncan accelerate development. Donor countries and\nagencies must be more inclined to ensure that they do\nnot give with one hand, only to take away with the\nother. In a globalizing world, donor partners\u2019 policies\n3\n\nin virtually every sector \u2014 including trade and\ninvestment, financial systems and the environment \u2014\nmust help promote development for the poorest. In the\nabsence of that, the goal of attaining sustainable\ndevelopment and managing globalization in a way that\nmaximizes its benefits for all will be difficult to\nrealize.\nIn the same spirit, I call on the development\npartners to consider more practical and realistic\nmeasures to deal with the huge amount of debt burden\nthat poor countries continue to shoulder. Development\npartners must continue to positively consider measures\nsuch as writing off debts; for even the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative and the Paris Club\ninitiatives to address the problems of highly indebted\nand poor developing countries have been cumbersome\nand slow.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, which is to be held in Mexico next\nMarch, offers a unique opportunity for achieving\nconsensus on how to mobilize new and additional\nresources for development. Solomon Islands looks\nforward to participating actively in the Conference.\nAgenda 21 remains a valid blueprint for the\nmanagement of the Earth\u2019s environment and the\nsustainable development of its resources. The World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\nJohannesburg next year, 10 years after Rio, should\nreach consensus on ways and means to ensure wider\nand effective implementation of Agenda 21 and\nsubsequent international programmes, including the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\nThe ocean and its bounty continue to be a\nprincipal resource for Solomon Islands. Our priorities\nconcerning oceans include sustainable fisheries\nmanagement, habitat protection and avoidance of\nmarine pollution. For us, the success of national\ndevelopment planning depends significantly on the\ncontinued health of the marine environment.\nThe unique circumstances of small island\ndeveloping States must be fully understood by the\ninternational community as we strive to address the\nserious threats of natural disasters, climate change and\nsea-level rise. The Kyoto Protocol remains a significant\nfirst step on the path to ensuring effective global action\nto combat climate change. The international\ncommunity must now build on the outcomes of the\nseventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the\nFramework Convention and work further towards the\nresolution of all outstanding negotiating issues.\nWe must recall the vision which the United\nNations was created to serve, i.e. that each and every\nhuman being deserves to live in dignity, be well\nnourished, be educated, have access to decent health\ncare and decent work, be respected and consulted, and\nbe able to develop their talents and creativity. Our\nchallenge is to strengthen the United Nations and other\ninternational institutions to strive more effectively\ntowards that vision. Solomon Islands remains\ncommitted to the reform initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral.\nThis session should also continue with efforts to\nmake the work of the General Assembly more efficient\nand effective. Furthermore, discussions on the reform\nof the Security Council have gone on for too long\nwithout substantial progress. Greater flexibility is\nrequired in order for this process to be completed. The\ngoal is to have a more democratic, transparent and\neffective Security Council.\nIn what is surely one of the bitter ironies of our\ntimes, free and democratic Taiwan, home to 23 million\npeople and a peace-loving country, has been excluded\nnot only from the United Nations and all its specialized\nagencies but also from nearly every other\nintergovernmental organization in the world. Although\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan willingly abides by\ninternational norms, standards and obligations, it is not\nable to enjoy the same normal standard privileges and\ntreatment accorded to others. This is simply unfair and\nunjust. The time has come to reconsider the exclusion\nof the Republic of China from the United Nations. The\nRepublic of China on Taiwan was a founding member\nof the Organization. It is a model of economic success\nand democratic politics. Taiwan has continued to share\nits development experiences with the wider\ninternational community when given the opportunity.\nIts continuing assistance during humanitarian crises\nalso deserves full commendation.\nSolomon Islands\u2019 appeal for Taiwan\u2019s\nrepresentation and participation in the United Nations\nsystem is premised on the principles of justice, dignity\nand the right of the people of Taiwan to be heard and\nrepresented in the international arena and for them to\nbe able to enjoy the same benefits that the rest of us\nenjoy. My Government firmly believes that Taiwan\u2019s\n4\n\nmembership in the United Nations will effectively\nserve to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the two\nChinas and provide a solid basis for a lasting\nreconciliation between them. Dialogue is the only\nmeans to resolve differences, and parity and mutual\nrespect must be the foundation upon which both sides\ncan build trust and confidence. The United Nations is\nthe best forum to nurture that trust and confidence. The\nissue of Taiwan\u2019s membership is consistent with the\nUnited Nations principle of universality. But, above all,\nit must be acknowledged that the Republic of China on\nTaiwan is fully committed to fulfilling the obligations\nof the United Nations Charter.\nFinally, next month my country is going to the\npolls to elect a new parliament, and thereafter a new\nGovernment will be formed. This election manifests\nour continuing commitment to constitutional and\nparliamentary democracy. It is a critical election, as it\nwill confer a new mandate for the next Government to\ncontinue with the ever-important responsibilities of\nensuring the rule of law, rebuilding the economy and\nfurther consolidating the current peace process.\nThose are difficult tasks, but we are determined\nto write a new page in our young history \u2014 a new page\nthat should provide for ethnic harmony and co-\nexistence, comprehensive and lasting peace, economic\nprosperity, and, above all, engender and nurture a\nbetter future and hope for our children and future\ngenerations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to extend my\nwarmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\nwell-deserved election as President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly. I also extend my\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for\nhis effective leadership during his presidency.\nThe heinous terrorists attacks of 11 September\nhave undeniably transformed international relations.\nThe United Nations is called upon to reinforce its\nprimary role as the standard bearer of the principles\nthat will shape the new environment and unite\nhumanity in the pursuit of justice, tolerance, the dignity\nof human beings, respect for human rights, the\npromotion of peace and zero-tolerance for the dark\nforces of terrorism.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\nCyprus, I reiterate our deep condolences and sympathy\nto the American people for the tragic loss of innocent\nlives caused by the abhorrent terrorist acts of 11\nSeptember. We unreservedly condemn these barbaric\nacts, which we consider to be attacks against the values\nand principles of humanity.\nThe community of nations must individually and\ncollectively take concerted and resolute action against\nterrorism. We believe that there is no justification or\nexcuse for terrorism and, at the same time, we reject\nany notion of linking this scourge with any particular\nreligious faith or ethnic group. We renew our\ncommitment to implement fully Security Council\nresolutions on terrorism, in particular resolution 1373\n(2001). Cyprus is actively participating in the common\neffort. It has ratified or acceded to nine of the 12\ninternational conventions pertaining to international\nterrorism. Furthermore, we expect an early ratification\nof the most recent Convention for the Suppression of\nthe Financing of Terrorism, which is already before the\nHouse of Representatives.\nThe Council of Ministers of the Republic of\nCyprus approved on 20 September a comprehensive\nproposal for the establishment of a task force to combat\ninternational terrorism.\nThe United Nations continues to be faced with\nold and new tasks: globalization, good governance,\nprotection of the environment and the need for\nsustainable development. The elimination of poverty\nand pandemics, securing a world free from the threat of\n2\n\nweapons of mass destruction and maintaining\ninternational peace and security remain high on the\nagenda. That is why we consider it imperative and the\nduty of each and every Member to provide the\nnecessary resources and support to our Organization.\nCyprus strongly supports the implementation of\nthe commitments we undertook last year in the\nMillennium Declaration. We also advocate the\nstrengthening and rationalization of the United Nations\nsystem, and we welcome the commitment of the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, to strive for a better\nand more just world. We congratulate him on the award\nof this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, which is well-\ndeserved recognition of the central role of the United\nNations and a tribute to its achievements, as well as to\nhis personal devotion and commitment.\nAt the beginning of this new millennium, we have\na special obligation to place new emphasis on the\npromotion and the protection of human rights and the\ndefeat of terrorism.\nHowever, the adoption of declarations and legal\ninstruments in the area of human rights is not enough.\nWe need to make accountable those violators of human\nrights and decisively strike at the culture of impunity.\nThis is why Cyprus strongly supports the early entry\ninto force of the International Criminal Court.\nWe are also deeply concerned with the increasing\nnumber and scope of humanitarian emergencies leading\nto an ever-rising number of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons. The plight of these unfortunate\npeople merits special attention and coordinated action.\nThe tragic events of 11 September have\nhighlighted the need to continue and accelerate efforts\nto prevent and resolve regional conflicts. The inability\nof the international community to put an end to the\nunacceptable situation in the Middle East undermines\nthe credibility of the system of collective security.\nCyprus, as a neighbouring country with close relations\nto the peoples of the region, is particularly pained by\nthe continuing cycle of violence, the tragic loss of\ninnocent human lives and the plight of the Palestinian\npopulation.\nWe look forward to a region living in peace,\nstability and security for all States, including the State\nof Israel. We reiterate our support for the fulfilment of\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding the creation of their own State. We urge both\nparties to work immediately towards finding ways to\nput an end to this cycle of violence and to respect the\nprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. We\nconsider the implementation of the recommendations\nof the Mitchell report as an absolutely necessary first\nstep in this direction. Cyprus reiterates its long-held\nposition for the implementation of Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\nWe follow the situation in the Balkans with\nparticular interest. Cyprus supports the implementation\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) on Kosovo.\nWe hope that the forces of peace and reconciliation will\nprevail and welcome the recent positive developments\nin the country. We support respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, including the right of return of\nrefugees and the return of property of displaced\npersons, and the principle of the inviolability of\nborders and territorial integrity.\nResolution of the Cyprus problem is long\noverdue. I cannot conceal my deep disappointment,\nshared by the Security Council in its statement to the\nPress of 26 September, at the refusal of the Turkish\nside to continue with the proximity talks to help the\nSecretary-General\u2019s efforts to find a comprehensive\nsettlement. The refusal of Turkish Cypriot leader\nMr. Denktash, with the support of Ankara, to resume\nthe talks that he abandoned a year ago, despite the\nofficial invitation extended by the Secretary-General in\nSeptember, is particularly disturbing.\nThe Secretary-General is now trying to invigorate\nthe process of negotiation. Therefore, in order to\nfacilitate the Secretary-General\u2019s effort, I will refrain\nfrom making remarks that normally I would have\nmade, other than to identify the reason for the failure to\nmake progress, which is the lack of political will on the\npart of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leader,\nMr. Denktash.\nThe Turkish side has abandoned the concept of a\nbi-zonal, bi-communal federal Cyprus, which Security\nCouncil resolutions have provided as the basis for the\nsolution. The Turkish side is also calling the\ninternational community to accept the so-called\nrealities, which is the legalization of Turkey\u2019s\noccupation of 37 per cent of Cypriot territory, in breach\nof international law, the forceful expulsion of Greek\nCypriot refugees from the occupied area and the\nsubsequent importation of 120,000 settlers from\nmainland Turkey in an effort to change the\n3\n\ndemographic character of Cyprus. As is well known,\nthe international community, through a plethora of\nUnited Nations resolutions, has repeatedly rejected this\npolicy. Acceptance of these so-called realities would\ncreate a very dangerous precedent in international\naffairs, striking at the very heart of the cherished\nprinciples of State sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nI would like to refer to the purely humanitarian\nproblem of missing persons, the resolution of which\nremains one of the most pressing issues for the\nGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus and for all\nCypriots.\nUnfortunately, Mr. President, I must once again\nreport to you that the agreement on missing persons of\n31 July 1997 between Mr. Rauf Denktash and myself,\nproviding for the exchange of information and for\ninformation on the location of graves of Greek Cypriot\nand Turkish Cypriot missing persons, has not been\nimplemented because of the continuing negative\nattitude of the Turkish side. We appeal again to the\nGovernment of Turkey to show the necessary political\nwill in order to bring a final solution to this tragic\nhumanitarian issue and abide by the l0 May 2001\njudgement of the European Court of Human Rights.\nIn the face of current difficulties, we do not\ndespair. Our vision for Cyprus is a departure from the\npassions of the past. History is often described as the\nbest teacher of wise men. We see as the future of our\ncountry: a reunited federal State, member of the\nEuropean Union, with human and other rights of each\nand every citizen fully protected under the process of\ndemocracy and the rule of law. We see a State with a\nsingle citizenship, sovereignty and international\npersonality, a demilitarized State enjoying the fruits of\nits labours in the wider European family, while at the\nsame time playing its rightful role in our immediate\nregion of the Eastern Mediterranean.\nI recommend to the leadership of Turkey that it\nabandon its threats to annex the occupied part of\nCyprus. I urge them to consider the obvious advantages\nof the solution of the Cyprus problem for stability in\nour region, the consolidation of the Greco-Turkish\nrapprochement and the promotion of Turkey\u2019s\naspirations to join the process of European integration.\nI urge the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktash,\nto join me in sharing the vision of a Cyprus too small\nto be divided but huge for the common prosperity of all\nits inhabitants. I urge him to look to the future and not\nto the past, to listen to the increasingly desperate\nvoices of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots and stop\nplacing obstacles, at each turn, to the good offices of\nthe Secretary-General for a solution to the Cyprus\nproblem.\nIt is noteworthy that the economic prospects for a\npost-settlement Cyprus are truly impressive. This\ngrowth will be even greater for our Turkish Cypriot\ncompatriots, who are currently suffering because of the\ndire political and economic situation in the occupied\narea. Tragically, almost 50 per cent have been forced to\ntake the cruel road of emigration. The Turkish Cypriots\nwill benefit considerably from the accession of our\ncountry to the European Union.\nI urge Mr. Denktash to realize that he and I are\nnot getting any younger and that we owe it to the\nyounger generations of Cypriots to do away with the\nwalls of division. For my part, I reiterate my readiness\nto engage in the process of negotiations with the\nnecessary political will and good faith for finding a fair\nand viable solution based on the United Nations\nresolutions, meeting the legitimate interests of all\nCypriots.\n\n\n\n"

On behalf of the\ndelegation of the Congo, I offer my most sincere\ncondolences to the bereaved families.\nI wish at the outset to congratulate you sincerely,\nSir, on your outstanding election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. The\ntrust that has been placed in you reflects the\n14\n\ninternational community\u2019s recognition of your qualities\nas an experienced diplomat and is a tribute to your\ncountry, the Republic of Korea, for the decisive role it\nplays in maintaining peace and security throughout the\nworld. You may rest assured of the full cooperation of\nthe delegation of the Congo.\nI express our gratitude to your predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the competence and deftness\nwith which he carried out his task.\nI also take this opportunity once again to offer\nour sincere congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan on his brilliant re-election and on his reception\nof the Nobel Peace Prize, which is a crown on his\npersonal contribution and on that of our Organization.\nWe still have in our mind\u2019s eye the terrifying and\nunbearable images of the attacks perpetrated against\nthe United States on 11 September \u2014acts of pure\nbarbarity, blind terrorism that we condemn absolutely,\nas we do all other forms of violence, which must be\ncurbed and eradicated. In keeping with the commitment\nundertaken at the Millennium Summit, we must be\nespecially vigilant and determined in the fight against\nthat evil, which has no place in the world today. The\nCongo fully endorses all the relevant United Nations\nresolutions aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of\nthe response of the international community to\nterrorism, in particular Security Council resolutions\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\nThe African continent, which has suffered for\nmany years from violence that has hampered its\ndevelopment and integration into the world of today,\nhas clearly condemned such acts, which can lead only\nto further destitution and poverty. That is why, at a\ntime when it is launching new initiatives to help it to\nemerge from crisis and promote development, Africa is\ndressing its wounds and appealing for various forms of\nlocal, regional and international mediation. These\ninitiatives have already borne fruit.\nWith regard to the conflict in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which is of particular concern\nto my country, we welcome the progress that has been\naccomplished in implementing the Lusaka Agreement,\nwhich is enabling the United Nations Organization\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n(MONUC) to move on to phase III of its deployment.\nIn this context, we welcome the Security Council\nmeeting with the Political Committee of the Lusaka\nAgreement. We invite all the parties to continue to\ndemonstrate their goodwill in carrying out the\ncommitments they have undertaken. We have great\nhopes for the inter-Congolese dialogue, which is\nscheduled to take place in South Africa.\nAfter years of war and illegal exploitation of its\nwealth, that brotherly country needs to return to peace,\nnational unity and political stability and to fully\nrecover its sovereignty so that it can achieve the\nprogress promised by its enormous potential. My\ncountry, for its part, has always maintained good-\nneighbourly relations with the other side of the Congo\nRiver, and we will continue to contribute in every way\nwe can to ensure the peace and normalization that are\nso greatly desired.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank\nMr. Kofi Annan and, through him, his Special\nRepresentative, Mr. Namanga Ngongi, for the action\nthat has been carried out within the framework of\nMONUC.\nAs for Burundi, we would like to pay tribute to\nPresident Nelson Mandela for his mediation, which has\nled to the formation of a government of national unity,\nto which we wish every success. This process, which\nshould contribute to a return to lasting peace and\nstability for that country, deserves the full support of\nthe international community.\nIn Angola, the consistent resort to terrorism and\nother acts of sabotage by UNITA, in disregard of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, should lead us to\nstrengthen the sanctions against that organization,\nwhich is responsible for the continuation of war in the\ncountry. The Congo reaffirms its solidarity with the\npeople and the Government of Angola, who are sparing\nno effort to restore peace and rebuild their country. The\ninternational community must provide all necessary\nassistance to Angola.\nGiven the continuing violence in the Middle East,\na return to the Oslo accords is urgently required if the\ncurrent deadlock is to be broken. We appeal to the\nparties in conflict to show a willingness to move\nforward so as to re-establish a dialogue, which remains\nthe only way to restore lasting peace in an area of the\nworld that has been troubled for far too long. We\ntherefore welcome the constructive proposals made by\nthe President of the United States of America, His\nExcellency George W. Bush, on the coexistence of two\nStates, Israel and Palestine, within secure and\n15\n\nrecognized borders, as required by Security Council\nresolutions.\nSituations such as these are often and almost\nsystematically accompanied by the massive\ndisplacement of populations, which causes\ndestabilization in neighbouring countries and worsens\ndomestic problems. Such is the case in my country,\nwhich is currently hosting more than 200,000 refugees\nmainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nAngola, Rwanda and, more recently, the Central\nAfrican Republic. The situation is a great cause for\nconcern in a country that is only just emerging from\nwar itself and is thus confronted by many other\nchallenges. Given the seriousness of this situation, I\nwould like once again to repeat the appeal of my\nGovernment for adequate assistance.\nAfter the signing, at the end of 1999, of\nagreements on the cessation of hostilities, the priority\ntasks set out by President Denis Sassou Nguesso were\nnational reconciliation and relaunching the democratic\nprocess, with a view to ensuring the reconstruction and\ndevelopment of the Congo. Today, almost all of these\nobjectives are in the process of being achieved.\nAt the political level, we organized in\nBrazzaville, from 14 March to 17 April 2001, a\nnational dialogue from which no one was barred, under\nthe auspices of an international mediator, His\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the\nGabonese Republic, to whom we would like once again\nto express our deep gratitude. That dialogue has been\nsanctioned by the signing of the convention for peace\nand reconstruction in the Congo, as well as by the\nadoption of a preliminary draft of the constitution. This\npreliminary draft was approved by the National\nTransitional Council \u2014 our transitional parliament \u2014\non 2 September, and it will be submitted to a\nreferendum before the end of this year. In preparation\nfor the constitutional referendum and the general\nelections, an administrative census has just been\ncarried out so as to draw up electoral lists.\nI would also like to mention the efforts being\nmade by the Government within the context of\nstrengthening the consolidation of peace. These\ninclude, in particular, the demobilization of over\n25,000 militia members; the collection of 10,817\nweapons and rounds of ammunition, of which 6,484\nhave already been destroyed, with the technical support\nof the International Organization for Migration;\nassistance for the reintegration of 6,844 former militia\nmembers, with the United Nations helping with more\nthan 2,190 small-scale projects; and the large-scale\nreturn of displaced persons and refugees to their\nnormal domicile.\nFurthermore, the establishment of a high\ncommission responsible for reintegrating former\ncombatants, a Committee for the follow-up of the\nconvention on peace and reconstruction in the Congo,\nand a national committee to eradicate poverty all form\npart of this momentum for the consolidation of peace.\nOur work will long continue to reflect the painful\nbackground against which it is taking place \u2014 the\nterrorist attacks. We have committed ourselves \u2014\nrightly, unanimously and resolutely \u2014 to fighting this\nscourge. But this means that we must eradicate\nanything that might be used as a pretext for acts of\nblind destruction. To decrease tension throughout the\nworld is to deal with situations that can foster\nterrorism. But we should remember that an apparently\nlocal crisis can have repercussions very far away \u2014\nsometimes even at the global level. In this context,\nglobalization must not be seen solely in economic and\ncommercial terms. In reality, we are talking about the\ndaily existence of individuals, peoples and nations,\nclosely linked because of the rupture of borders.\nThe eleventh of September just gave us a painful\nreminder that the world is one in its suffering, meaning\nthat we must also remain as one as we seek better\ntimes. That is why we must reduce, as quickly as\npossible, the gulf that separates the poorest among us\nfrom the wealthiest.\nThe socio-economic tensions we see throughout\nthe world are also the result of extreme poverty in\ndeveloping countries. Over 1 billion men and women\nare victims of malnutrition and do not even have access\nto drinking water or minimal health services. Unless\nwe accelerate growth, poverty will continue to worsen.\nWe must all therefore mobilize generally in order to\nurgently implement the strategies we ourselves have\nadopted here, especially those adopted during the\nMillennium Summit.\nWe should welcome the recent United Nations\ninitiative to set up a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS\nand to respond to the desire of developing countries to\nhave access to new therapies at a lower cost.\n16\n\nWith regard to the particular economic situation\nin Africa, Congo expects that during this session the\ninternational community will support the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development. As the\nAssembly is aware, the New Partnership \u2014 which\nharmonizes the concerns of the new African Union in\nthe areas of development and economic integration \u2014\nis the response that Africa unanimously intends to\npresent to the challenges of globalization.\nIt is also appropriate now to again look at the\nessential instrument in that international struggle,\nnamely, the United Nations. The conferences and\nspecial session organized by the United Nations this\nyear \u2014 on the least developed countries, AIDS, human\nsettlements, the illicit trade in light weapons in all its\naspects, racism and many other issues \u2014 once again\nproves that our Organization remains a vital and\nirreplaceable instrument at the service of humankind. It\nis also in this framework that the fight against terrorism\nmust take place.\nAs we stated during the Millennium Summit last\nyear, we must, while relying on the United Nations,\nwork more resolutely and methodically to find\nsolutions to all those concerns. It is for this reason that\nI would like, in conclusion, to reaffirm my country\u2019s\ncommitment to the United Nations, which must remain\nthe preferred forum for international coordination and\ndialogue among civilizations, for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, for the peaceful\nsettlement of conflict, and for international economic\ncooperation in the service of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I should also like to extend my\ncongratulations to all the other members of the Bureau.\nI am sure that your prestige and acknowledged\ndiplomatic skills will contribute to the successful work\nof the General Assembly at this session.\nI should also like to extend sincere\ncongratulations to this Organization and to the\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. Mexico welcomes the\nfact that they were awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Peace\nPrize. That is a well-deserved recognition of the\ndedication and clarity of vision that have marked the\nwork of the Secretary-General. It fills us with hope\nregarding the efforts that this Organization will have to\nmake in order to meet the international challenges of\nthe twenty-first century.\nI am addressing the General Assembly on behalf\nof the women and men of my country, Mexico \u2014 a\ncountry that is in the process of a profound\ntransformation, determined to strengthen democracy\nand development, as well as to take on greater\nresponsibilities in shaping the new international system\nwith a view to fostering the prosperity, peace and\nsecurity that every inhabitant of the world deserves.\nMexican society is firmly committed to making\nMexico a country that contributes positively to the\nworthiest objectives of human well-being. Aware that\nthere is a diversity of views on ways to achieve this\nend, Mexico favours dialogue and agreement as\nbenchmarks to guide our endeavours. For Mexico the\nUnited Nations is the best example of a global forum\nwhere the voices of all men and women can merge into\na veritable concert of nations.\nThis is a Mexico that today renews its full\ncommitment to the United Nations \u2014 which not only\ndemands full respect for the purposes and principles of\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law,\nbut that is also committed to the development of new,\nuniversally observed rules and standards for the\nregulation of international relations.\nThis is a Mexico that acts firmly in the defence\nand protection of human rights and of democracy, at all\ntimes and in all places, beginning, of course, within our\nown territory, promoting full respect for fundamental\nfreedoms on the basis of tolerance, plurality and equity.\nThat is why my Government has initiated formal talks\nwith the various political parties in Mexico in order to\ncreate favourable conditions for the promotion of a\nconstitutional reform that will allow Mexico to ratify\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\nwhich our country signed last year.\nMy Government has also started a necessary\nupdating of Mexico\u2019s international obligations in the\nfield of human rights and international humanitarian\nlaw. I have submitted for consideration by the Mexican\nSenate the ratification, accession or acceptance of 11\nother legal instruments in areas such as the forcible\ndisappearance of persons, the rights of the child, the\nelimination of discrimination against women and the\nprotection of victims of international armed conflicts.\nThis new commitment on the part of Mexico to\nthe defence of human rights was also reflected in the\nrecent release, for humanitarian reasons, of Rodolfo\nMontiel and Teodoro Cabrera, two environmental\nactivists in Mexico. This effort in the field of human\nrights was also reflected in the broad disclosure of\nState security agencies files, which will contribute to\nincreasing transparency regarding both present and past\nevents, thus making it a central element of my\nadministration. Mexico is taking concrete steps to\ndemonstrate that its commitment to the norms of the\ninternational community is profound, sincere and\nresolute.\n17\n\nThe establishment of the United Nations more\nthan 50 years ago was the triumph of hope and freedom\nover the suffering inflicted by the two world wars on\nhumanity, Today, however, threats to peace and\nsecurity do not emerge only from acts of aggression\namong States. The new threats also arise from internal\nconflicts that have cross-border effects, such as the\nmassive movement of displaced peoples, humanitarian\ntragedies, grave violations of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, and the exacerbation of\nnationalism and religious fanaticism. These threats also\nderive from worldwide phenomena such as\ntransnational organized crime, environmental\ndegradation, AIDS, and, of course, terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations.\nThere is no doubt that the magnitude and the\ncruelty of the 11 September attacks have underscored\nthe vulnerability of States and the fragility of world\npeace. It is a matter of concern to us that terrorist\ngroups can gain access to weapons of mass destruction\nand that they also benefit from the traffic in arms,\norganized crime, money laundering and drug\ntrafficking.\nInternational terrorism not only flouts\ninternational law, but it also endangers the stability of\nthe community of nations and economic development\nprocesses, increasing unemployment and preventing\nheadway from being made in the alleviation of poverty.\nFor this reason, Mexico categorically rejects any\nargument that seeks to justify terrorist activities.\nNothing \u2014 not the justness of a cause, the inequality of\nforces with respect to an antagonist, poverty, or any\nother grounds \u2014 can justify resorting to violence for\npolitical ends.\nMexico reiterates its commitment to the fight\nagainst terrorism and its decision to fully implement\nresolution 1373 (2001) of the Security Council, which\nestablishes a series of measures for fighting\ninternational terrorism and cutting its ties to practices\nsuch as money laundering and organized crime.\nWe are firmly committed to the fight against new\nthreats to international peace and security. We believe\nthat the international community should meet these\nchallenges on the basis of three principles: first, the\nsupremacy of the United Nations; secondly, the\nstrengthening of international cooperation in resolving\nglobal problems; and thirdly, the shaping of an\ninternational order based on universally observed rules\nand standards that meet the needs and aspirations of the\ncommunity of nations.\nThe Government of Mexico is determined to\nassist in this effort. For that reason, Mexico feels\ndeeply honoured to have been elected, after a 20-year\nabsence, as a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil for 2002-2003. It wishes to express its deep\ncommitment in this respect. We thank the international\ncommunity for its support and express our\ndetermination to work actively and responsibly in\nfavour of the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. Our intention is that Mexico\u2019s participation in\nthe Security Council will amplify the voices of\ncountries that are not usually heard on the international\nscene.\nIn the search for lasting solutions to the new\nthreats now facing the international system, we must\nnot fail to address situations that have contributed to\ntheir emergence, such as the lack of economic\ndevelopment in many nations, the deepening of poverty\nand exclusion. The challenges of development not only\nremain with us, but have gradually increased with the\ngrowing economic and social inequalities.\nMexico therefore calls on the international\ncommunity to give priority to the fight against poverty\nand social exclusion. My country reaffirms its interest\nin taking a lead in promoting the Agenda for\nDevelopment, providing it with renewed impetus and a\nmore effective approach, so that the United Nations\nand the multilateral institutions can fulfil the\ncommitments contained in the Millennium Declaration.\nIt is because of the importance we attach to this\nissue that Mexico offered to host the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Monterrey. I invite all heads of State or\nGovernment to contribute, through their active\nparticipation in the Conference, to strengthening the\ninternational community\u2019s efforts to promote world\ndevelopment that is more just and more equitable, thus\ncreatively helping to improve the institutions\nresponsible for development financing.\nWe face the complex task of integrating our\nsocieties, without exclusion, in the process of the joint\ncreation and equitable distribution of the opportunities\nand benefits of globalization. We must ensure that all\ncitizens become stakeholders in that process; to do that,\nwe need an enabling international environment,\nincluding sufficient levels of public and private\n18\n\nfunding, along with the consolidation of an inclusive\ninternational economic system that is conducive to\nmore equitable human development.\nIt will be impossible to make the world more just\nif we permit the exclusion of the most vulnerable\ngroups. That is why my Government has just proposed\nthe establishment of a special committee to draft a\nbroad, comprehensive international convention to\npromote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled\npersons. The convention\u2019s ultimate goal should be to\nput in place a binding universal legal instrument for the\nbenefit of the disabled, guaranteeing the fundamental\nrights of millions of men, women and children\nworldwide. Mexico hopes that this important\nendeavour will enjoy the support of the States Members\nof the United Nations.\nThe history of relations among nations reflects\nsuccesses, but also sadly missed opportunities. Today,\nour efforts to combat terrorism and to promote\ndevelopment \u2014 the two focuses of my statement\ntoday \u2014 may be the start of a new history of successes\nfor the United Nations.\nThe brutal events of 11 September make it\nimperative that we, the international community,\nengage in multilateral negotiations to formulate new\nrules and standards to guarantee international peace\nand security. There is no doubt that the way in which\nour nations face the challenge of terrorism will have an\nimpact on the principles and priorities of international\nrelations in coming years.\nAs a country that is a bridge between regions and\ncultures, Mexico is determined to play an active and\nleading role in shaping an international system that can\nmeet the challenges facing us today.\nThis is a defining moment. Our fundamental\nvalues and the vitality and viability of the United\nNations are being put to the test. The community of\nnations must show that it can meet this extraordinary\nchallenge. This can be a new founding stage in the\nhistory of the Organization, which will yield the\nmandates and competences that are indispensable in a\nworld that is starkly different from that of 1945 but\nwhose aspirations to peace, respect for human dignity,\njustice and freedom still remain those of the San\nFrancisco Charter.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am speaking\nhere while still in shock over the terrible aeroplane\ncrash in Queens, our immediate neighbourhood,\nespecially since the area of Rockaway, where so many\nbrave New York firefighters live, was already suffering\nin the aftermath of the earlier catastrophe. I wish to\nexpress my deep sympathy to all those families and to\nthe great number of people affected by this tragedy.\nLet me at the outset congratulate His Excellency\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to this high office.\nWhile assuring him of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation\nand support, I am confident that under his guidance and\nleadership \u2014 which he has already proven in the first\ndays of his new function \u2014 this session of the General\nAssembly will contribute to strengthening global\ncooperation and its indispensable platform, the United\nNations, in the coming months.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\nreiterate my very best wishes to the Secretary-General\non his appointment to a second term of office.\nFurthermore, I would like to congratulate him very\nwarmly on being awarded, jointly with the United\nNations, the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour and\nrecognition he truly deserves for his leadership,\ndedication and courage in the service of our\nOrganization. This award also signals recognition of\nand encouragement for the United Nations and all those\nwho are committed to its mission, not least United\nNations staff members.\nAllow me to also express here our thanks to the\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the many efforts he\nundertook not only in conducting day-to-day business,\nbut also in revitalizing the United Nations, in particular\nthe General Assembly.\nMy colleague, the Foreign Minister of Belgium,\nhas already addressed this Assembly on behalf of the\nEuropean Union. Austria fully endorses his remarks.\nTwo months have passed now since the heinous\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. Although we are still\nin shock at the loss of thousands of innocent lives, we\nhave, however, also been encouraged by the resolve\nexpressed in the collective response of the community\nof nations, here in the General Assembly and in the\nSecurity Council. This unanimous strong reaction gives\nus hope that today our nations are ready to cross over a\nthreshold, leaving behind a world of deadly divisions\nand entering a genuine global community.\nThere are some positive signs to that effect.\nThese are, first, that during the past weeks, we have\nwitnessed new astonishing political \u2014 maybe even\ngeopolitical \u2014 alignments that, if followed through,\nare comparable to other watershed events of historic\nproportions. Secondly, the menace of an\nunprecedented, devastating type of terrorism is\ncompelling us to take a fresh look at the root causes of\nmuch that is unacceptable in our world, according to\nour own standards, but which we have been tolerating,\nor at least living with, quite contrary to our declared\nprinciples. I refer to the abject levels of poverty,\ninequality and injustice. These factors are at the origin\nof many conflicts around the globe. Some of them are\nparticularly dangerous, providing breeding grounds for\nglobal terrorism or serving as pretexts for terrorists. It\nwould be irresponsible if we \u2014 the international\ncommunity \u2014 did not engage in renewed efforts to find\nsolutions to these regional conflicts, be they in the\nMiddle East, in Afghanistan, in Kashmir, in the\nCaucasus or in the Balkans, as well as in the area\naround the Great Lakes, for instance, which has seen so\nmuch human suffering.\nThe European Union, on a continent marked by\ncenturies of war, has developed its model of conflict\nresolution. It is held in three words: cooperation,\npartnership, integration. The European Union is\nengaged in a welcome policy of extending this zone of\npeace. We hope that the enlarged Union, planned to\n23\n\nbecome a Union of 28 and later more, will be able to\ncontribute more effectively to peace and stability in the\nworld.\nUnder the present circumstances, Austria\u2019s\npriorities outside Europe are the Middle East and\nCentral Asia, not least because these areas have a direct\nbearing on the fight against terrorism in its present\nphase.\nThe Middle East conflict has been on our agenda\nwithout interruption since the time of the creation of\nthe United Nations. There is no doubt that we have a\nspecial obligation to contribute to a just and viable\nsolution. A heightened sense of responsibility is felt\nwhen, on the one hand, violence escalates, but when,\non the other \u2014 as I see it \u2014 new opportunities have\nemerged. Austria is therefore of the opinion that major\nconcerted efforts should be undertaken so that\nnegotiations can resume on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions without delay. Only sincere\nnegotiations and a sincere renunciation of violence can\nbring a rapprochement of the two parties and, finally,\npeace.\nAfghanistan is a reminder of what happens when\na conflict is neglected too long. Now, there is a new\ndimension unfolding. We are forced to act. The\nhumanitarian tragedy is obvious. In this context,\nCentral Asia deserves increased attention, for example,\nin view of assistance in the maintenance of stability\nand concertation aiming at the necessary reconstruction\nof Afghanistan.\nI should like to say a word as to the Balkans, a\nneighbouring region to my country. It must not be\nneglected, although new dangers emerge elsewhere. In\nthe western Balkans, there is progress, especially in\nZagreb, in Belgrade, in Tirana and in Sarajevo, but\noverall stability and economic recovery are not yet\nassured. Extremists have not yet disarmed. We have to\nkeep up a high profile of international commitment.\nCombating terrorism is, of course, not a one-\ndimensional task. It requires cooperation on many\nfronts. I see the United Nations as playing a key role in\nthis regard. This requires a clarification and\ncoordination of tasks within the United Nations system\nso as to ensure the necessary synergy. There is also a\nrole for regional cooperation. To provide an example, a\nso called regional security partnership has been\nestablished between Austria and some of its\nneighbours, candidates for European Union\nmembership, across the boundaries that, for half a\ncentury, divided Europe.\nOverall, we must address long-term societal\ndevelopment at the local, national and global levels and\nthe capacities required to build a universally shared\npolitical culture based on respect for human rights and\nhuman dignity, including for the plurality of identities\nat all levels of society.\nLet me elaborate now on the United Nations role.\nThe time has certainly come to significantly strengthen\nthe United Nations capabilities and programmes in\ncombating and preventing terrorism. The complexity of\nthe challenge requires intersectoral and inter-\ninstitutional cooperation. We have to enable the\nprincipal organs of the Organization, including their\nspecialized subsidiary organs, such as the Security\nCouncil\u2019s Committee on terrorism, the General\nAssembly\u2019s Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism, the\nEconomic and Social Council\u2019s Commission on Crime\nPrevention and Criminal Justice and the appropriate\nSecretariat units to perform the tasks that are now\nurgently needed.\nThe Commission on Crime Prevention and\nCriminal Justice will hold a special meeting on\nterrorism in the context of the Vienna Declaration on\nCrime and Justice on 15 November 2001. Just one\nweek prior to the terrorist attacks of 11 September,\nplans of action for the implementation of the Vienna\nDeclaration were adopted. They will play an important\nrole in the system-wide response to international\nterrorism, including a comprehensive set of\nrecommendations for both national and international\naction. These recommendations stress once more the\nexisting relationship between terrorism, on the one\nhand, and crime, including transnational organized\ncrime and illicit drug trafficking, on the other.\nThe United Nations Centre for International\nCrime Prevention and its Terrorism Prevention Branch\nhave received a focused mandate, which should serve\nas a solid basis for enhancing the capabilities of the\nUnited Nations in the prevention of terrorism. To this\nend, the human and financial resources should be\nstrengthened accordingly.\nNeedless to say, the challenge of terrorism\nrequires the full support of each and every\nGovernment. Ratification of the various international\nlegal instruments, as well as the conclusion of\nnegotiations concerning a comprehensive international\n24\n\nconvention against terrorism, are of fundamental\nimportance. The Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\nUnited Nations should also get immediately active in\nproviding, where requested, concrete assistance to\nMember States in implementing national legislation\nrequired by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\nas well as in national capacity-building.\nSeveral items on our global agenda have\nreminded us of the fundamental importance of the\nindividual citizen and of society in economic, social,\ncultural and institutional development. Increasingly, we\nhave understood the strategic role of the basic\nprinciples and values of our societies upon which the\nfuture of mankind is based. Our rejection of terrorism\nmust be absolute. At the same time, we need to\nstrengthen our networks and skills in dialogue, cross-\nidentification and solidarity.\nWe do need a globally shared political culture\nthat is based on respect for global diversity, which\nfinds its only limits in the right of others to diversity.\nWe must never allow fanaticism, violence and\nterrorism to undermine the fabric on which peace and\nsecurity are built. Now more than ever, we have to\nredouble our efforts in the development of our societies\nbased on plurality and trust among peoples and\ncultures.\nIn this context, the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to\npromote dialogue among civilizations, an initiative of\nPresident Khatami, can have enormous significance.\nAustria had the pleasure of inviting the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Group of Eminent Persons for its first\nmeeting in Vienna and was honoured by the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s personal participation in last summer\u2019s\nSalzburg dialogue among civilizations. Austria\u2019s\ncommitment to dialogue has found its expression in a\nseries of inter-religious encounters, especially between\nChristianity and Islam, over the past 10 years. These\nencounters have served to identify common values and\nto project them into the wider communities. For us,\nsuch dialogue has the core objective of developing\nsocieties\u2019 capacities in preventing hatred,\ndisintegration and politically motivated violence\nagainst fellow citizens.\nAustria\u2019s efforts have also focused on another\nelement of societal development. Long-term strategies\nof terrorism prevention require a globally shared\nculture of human rights. Let me mention briefly the\ngrowing cooperation between qualified regional\ninstitutions for human rights education and learning in\nAfrica, South Asia, the Far East and the Pacific,\nEurope and Latin America. The proclamation of human\nrights cities in all of these regions might merit specific\nattention by the appropriate organs of the United\nNations, including the Commission on Human\nSettlements.\nWe are aware that there is a direct relationship\nbetween the internal negation of human rights, on the\none hand, and a culture of violence that may eventually\nproject its effects not only internally but also\ninternationally and even globally. In view of\naccelerated globalization and worldwide economic,\ncultural and information relations, we may have to take\nproactive measures to strengthen our shared basic\nbeliefs and political values through education and\nlearning processes. The current United Nations Decade\nfor Human Rights Education might also offer\nopportunities for appropriate initiatives in response to\nthe horrifying scenario of global terrorism.\nIn this context, we have to give greater\nrecognition to the role of women in providing human\nsecurity and human development in all our societies.\nThe recognition is due in particular in crisis areas\nwhere women have not only been the victims of most\nof the intra-societal violence, but have also assured the\nsurvival of the neediest.\nA case in point is Afghanistan and Afghan\nsociety. Eighty-five per cent of refugees and internally\ndisplaced persons are women and children. In fact,\nthose who are often depicted as the weakest element in\nsociety had to bear the brunt of violence and\nrepression. As we design our programmes for\nreconstructing a post-terrorist Afghanistan, we must\nconceive of programmes by which women, in\nparticular those now in refugee camps, are enabled to\ncontribute their share in a governance of development,\npeace and cooperation. This is essential for a society\nthat wishes to overcome the scars of decades of\nconflict and war. To be concrete, I therefore suggest\nthat education and training programmes aimed at\nempowering women \u2014 in particular, those in refugee\ncamps \u2014 to assume public responsibility in the\nreconstruction of their country be immediately\nimplemented.\nThe media bear an increasingly important\nresponsibility in shaping societies\u2019 value structures and\ncapabilities. As Austria\u2019s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang\n25\n\nSch\u00fcssel said in his statement on the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations at the General\nAssembly\u2019s 42nd meeting, Austria is taking an\ninitiative, in the context of the partnership between the\nEuropean Union and the Mediterranean countries, that\nwill focus on the special role and responsibility of the\nmedia in this partnership and in the societal\ndevelopment towards accepting and benefiting from the\nplurality of cultures and identities in this region.\nIn conclusion, I should like to make a few\ncomments on other very important developments with\nregard to items on our global agenda. The sustainable\nuse of the local, national, regional and global natural\nresources with which we are endowed continues to be\nof foremost importance. The recent study by the\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\n(IIASA) on the projected dramatic reduction of\nagricultural productivity \u2014 between 45 and 55 per cent\nin Africa, India, southern China and Latin America \u2014\nover the next 50 years due to climate change reminds\nus that the processes of long-term global change need\nas much action as our activities in coping with crises\nand combating criminal terrorism. The World Summit\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will need\nnot only a technical but also a political focus with an\nappropriate resolve for our shared global development.\nOne specific area where newly shared policies\nand institutional support may be required, is the\nintegration of energy policies into the global\nsustainable development agenda. The Commission on\nSustainable Development at its ninth session and the\nthird United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries recognized the strong connection\nbetween energy-policy interventions and poverty\nreduction. Energy considerations should therefore be\nfully integrated into the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration. Vienna, which hosts four\nprominent international organizations in the field of\nglobal energy policies \u2014 the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization of\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and\nIIASA \u2014 could offer, with Austria\u2019s support, a\nframework for developing an innovative platform in\nthis regard. I look forward to exploring this issue\nfurther with interested partners.\nWith many developing regions having to cope\nwith the difficult and often precarious management of\nmountain resources, we should take advantage of the\nInternational Year of Mountains, 2002, for new\ninitiatives in exchanging experience and for new\nprogrammes of cooperation.\nFinally, we are still working on implementing our\nresolve to strengthen the Economic and Social Council\nof the United Nations for accomplishing its important\ntasks. The Economic and Social Council reform paper\nby the Secretariat\u2019s Department of Economic and\nSocial Affairs contains, I think, very valuable\ncontributions to our ongoing debate. As Austria already\nsuggested years ago, coordination and integration of\nthe United Nations system\u2019s reporting in economic and\nsocial affairs and the preparation of a comprehensive\n\u201cstate of the world\u201d report by the Secretary-General\nwould not only facilitate but significantly enhance the\nrole of the Economic and Social Council in policy\nformulation in this field.\nWhen coping with the dynamic processes of\nglobal change in the economic sector, we have to put\nthe human being back into the centre of our policies.\nNew efforts have to be undertaken to internalize the\nmultiple dimensions and costs of globalization. In this\ncontext, let me especially welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s initiative of a new partnership with the\nglobal business community, inviting it to share in the\nresponsibility for what is happening in the global\npublic space.\nAll the concerns I am addressing in this statement\nhave a common focus: understanding the human being\nas an actor, a perpetrator, a victim and a partner, in\nother words, as the basic paradigm of global\ndevelopment. This is why human development, human\nrights and human security are the points from which we\nhave to address both the current crises and our long-\nterm development objectives."

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\nsession is taking place at a time when there is a new\ninternational awareness of the global nature of\nproblems of peace, security and development. The\nbarbaric terrorist attacks against the United States on\n11 September, and their alarming consequences, made\nit clear that terrorism is now a factor for worldwide\npolitical and economic destabilization.\nAlgeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to the\nfamilies of the victims of those horrible acts. It did so\nwith all the more sincerity and feeling because for\nmore than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring the\nhorrors of terrorism. The international reaction to this\ndevastating scourge has been a heartening collective\nwake-up call. Mobilization and multifaceted action to\ncombat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is\nnow worldwide. In that regard, Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) unquestionably constituted a\nmajor breakthrough. It was adopted under Chapter VII\nof the Charter and obliges all States unequivocally and\ndutifully to outlaw terrorist activities and their\nsupporters and sponsors, wherever they may be.\nAlgeria is fully cooperating with the international\ncommunity in the implementation of that universal\ncollective endeavour. Algeria stresses how important it\nis that the resolution be strictly implemented and\nreaffirms the imperative need for universal adherence\nto existing international anti-terrorism instruments and\nfor the ratification of relevant regional instruments.\nAlgeria believes, inter alia, that the adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention to combat terrorism is\nessential. For its part, my country is ready to cooperate\nwith other nations to achieve this as quickly as\npossible.\nThe dangers that terrorism poses to global peace\nand security highlight the need for a ruthless struggle\nagainst it, in particular through dismantling bases and\nnetworks, draining sources of financing, cooperating in\nexchanging information and providing proper\nequipment to countries that are victims of terrorism,\nand reviewing permissive national legislation regarding\nthe right of asylum as well as the justification for\nmurder or planning criminal activities to be committed\nin third countries.\nWhile the urgency of this struggle has made it\npossible to achieve notable progress in a few weeks,\nwe must be unanimous in our determination if we are\nto confront the roots of terrorism \u2014 that is, we must\naddress the problems that constitute a breeding ground\nfor extremism and intolerance throughout the world.\nThis means that Islam, a religion of peace and\ntolerance, cannot in any way be associated with\nterrorism, which is alien to its values. It also\nunderscores the importance of ensuring that the anti-\nterrorist struggle is not aimed at any one country,\nreligion, culture or civilization.\nThe United Nations, which has often diagnosed\nand analysed the state of our world, has rightly\nemphasized that problems tend to be of an economic,\npolitical and social nature and that their causes are both\nnational and international. The denial of the right of\npeoples to self-determination, the exacerbated\nphenomena of exclusion and poverty, the persistence of\neconomic imbalances, the intensification of social\ninequalities, the continued deterioration of the\nenvironment and the pursuit of the arms race are all\nproblems awaiting solutions and concrete measures\nthat, in many cases, United Nations forums have\nalready defined and adopted in many cases adopted.\nThe commitments undertaken recently to make\nglobalization a factor of integration rather than of\nexclusion \u2014 in particular the objectives enshrined in\nthe Millennium Declaration \u2014 take on full importance\nhere, since they highlight the urgent need for effective\nmeasures to build a stable and united world on a solid\nfoundation. Today, reality amply demonstrates that\nglobalization, despite its enormous potential and\nopportunities, has not yet yielded the expected results\nwith regard to the universal improvement of living\nconditions. The processes to which it leads have too\noften widened the existing cracks within societies and\nexacerbated differences among nations. This has\nencouraged marginal groups to exploit the difficult\nsocial situations to which many peoples are subject and\nto promote isolationism and rejection of the other.\nThe Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by\nthe Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nprovide a framework for inspiration and action to build\nmore harmonious and fraternal relations among people.\nFirst of all, there is a need at the United Nations\nlevel to set aright unacceptable situations of injustice\nand denial of rights. In Palestine, the serious situation\nthat prevails as a result of the continued Israeli\noccupation and its oppressive practices requires the\nattention of the entire international community. It\ndemands urgent action to put an end to the daily trials\nof the Palestinian people, who are subjected to a\ndeliberate policy by the Israeli army of intimidation,\n25\n\nabuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger the\nresumption of the peace process, taking the entire\nregion to the brink of a conflagration with incalculable\nconsequences.\nGiven the situation, Algeria reaffirms its total\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people and their\ninalienable right to an independent State with Al-Quds\nal-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon the\ninternational community to ensure the protection of the\nPalestinian people by sending international observers\nto the region.\nAlgeria wishes to emphasize that only a solution\nbased on international legality \u2014 in particular Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) \u2014 as\nwell as on the principle of land for peace, adopted at\nthe Madrid Conference, can ensure just and lasting\npeace and security for all the peoples of the region, as\nChairman Yasser Arafat indicated in his speech this\nmorning. Algeria would also like to reaffirm its\nsolidarity with the brotherly peoples of Syria and\nLebanon for the restoration of their lands still under\nIsraeli occupation. In addition, Algeria welcomes the\ndecision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions on\nthe brotherly people of Sudan and seizes the\nopportunity to renew its appeal for the lifting of the\nsanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples.\nThe situation in the Western Sahara, where the\nsettlement process has been halted for more than a year\nand a half, is also a source of great concern and a factor\nof instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole.\nThe United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\nWestern Sahara (MINURSO) has not been able to\ncontinue the implementation of the settlement plan of\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU), though it had been accepted by the two\nparties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and\nthe Frente Popular para la Liberaci\u00f3n de Saguia el-\nHamra y del R'o de Oro (POLISARIO), in particular\nbecause of the many challenges that followed the\nidentification stage.\nAction by the United Nations in the Western\nSahara, carried out through MINURSO since 1991,\nshould be commended, and the progress made within\nthe framework of the implementation of the settlement\nplan \u2014 in particular the identification of the electoral\nbody \u2014 should be maintained and consolidated. Here,\nthe two parties should be reminded of their obligation\nto cooperate openly and sincerely with MINURSO, to\nconclude the referendum process and to call upon the\nbodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue to\nstrictly respect their mandate.\nThe unswerving position of Algeria on the issue\nof the Western Sahara stems from its dedication to\ninternational legality and to respect for the right of\npeople to self-determination. Algeria therefore supports\nthe holding of a free and transparent referendum,\norganized by the United Nations that will allow this\npeople to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiative\nto settle that dispute must be part of the framework of\ninternational legality and, in particular, of the\nresolutions on decolonization adopted by the General\nAssembly.\nElsewhere on the African continent, the\ndetermination of African peoples and leaders and the\nsupport of the international community are starting to\nbear fruit in the areas of conflict prevention and\nsettlement. The Peace Agreement concluded in Algiers\nin June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea put an end\nto a devastating two-year war between those two\nbrotherly African countries and opened the way to a\npeaceful settlement of their dispute. The progress made\nsince the full deployment of the United Nations\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea attests to the\ncommitment of those two countries to strengthening\nthe basis for a lasting peace and for mutually beneficial\ncooperation.\nSimilarly, the implementation of the Lusaka\nCeasefire Agreement, which has long been plagued by\nnumerous difficulties, is now well under way. The\ninternational community must pursue its efforts to\nmake the settlement process irreversible and to\nfacilitate the inter-Congolese dialogue.\nAfrica also welcomes the progress made in Sierra\nLeone in the implementation of its disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration programmes, which\nhave been made possible by the courageous and\ndetermined action of the United Nations Mission in\nSierra Leone.\nDespite the positive developments that have\noccurred in Angola there, UNITA continues to sow\ndeath and destruction among the people of that country.\nA return to security will require strict respect by all\nStates for the punitive measures laid down by the\nSecurity Council against UNITA.\n26\n\nFinally, regarding recent events in Burundi, my\ncountry welcomes the decision of the parties to the\nconflict there to establish a transitional Government\nthat guarantees the participation of all the inhabitants\nof that country in the management of their own affairs.\nWe hail the important role played by Mr. Nelson\nMandela in achieving understanding among the parties\nin Burundi in the implementation of the Arusha\nAgreement.\nThe end of the cold war eased the climate of\nsuspicion and distrust that permeated international\nrelations and was replaced by a measure of optimism\nbased on new prospects. We hope that this optimism\nwill signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories of\nnuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that it\nwill open the way to a bold approach to guaranteeing\nthe security of all States. Given this qualitative\ntransformation in international relations, our hope of\nseeing our planet forever free of nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction is indeed\nstrengthened.\nThe need to establish renewable international\ncooperation based on mutual interests and shared duties\nand responsibilities is more urgent than ever before.\nThis new spirit must become an incentive for launching\ncomprehensive initiatives to seek a genuine\nunderstanding of the problems plaguing the entire\nworld. In brief, we must prepare for international\ngovernance that truly reflects the requirements of\nrationality, transparency, justice, democratic\nparticipation and responsibility, without which any\ndiscussion of a new world order is meaningless and of\nno use to humanity.\nThe progress that has been achieved at the\npolitical and economic levels in several regions and\ncountries must be consolidated and enhanced through\nthe international promotion of good governance. In this\nrespect, the direct and indirect threats to sustainable\ndevelopment that jeopardize the survival of our planet\nrequire us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the context\nof the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\nUrgent measures must be taken to halt the devastating\neffects of various means and types of production and\nconsumption that have become untenable. These must\nbe transformed in a qualitative way, taking into account\nthe needs of mankind as a whole.\nIn the same vein, the ministerial conference of the\nWorld Trade Organization that opened in Doha two\ndays ago and the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, to be held in a few months\nin Mexico, are promising prospects for the lasting\nresumption of growth in the developing countries and\nfor improving the living standards of their peoples.\nFour months ago, African countries, meeting at\nthe 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Government\nof the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, clearly\nexpressed Africa\u2019s official response to the new needs\nand aspirations of its peoples through their solemn\nlaunching of the transitional process towards the\nAfrican Union and their adoption of the New African\nInitiative. These steps form an integral part of the\nreform process undertaken over the past few years by\nthe African countries at the national, regional and\ncontinental levels to bring Africa into step with an\never-changing world.\nAware of the magnitude of the challenges facing\nthe continent and of the need to acquire a global\nintegrated programme for the social and economic\nrecovery of the continent, African leaders at the Lusaka\nsummit adopted a plan that was conceived by and for\nAfrica. Algeria, which actively participated in the\ncreation and drafting of the New Partnership for\nAfrican Development, believes that this programme\nwill open the way to practical solutions to the\neconomic and social problems of Africa. Thus, in order\nfor our Organization to bolster its credibility and\neffectiveness, to address the great changes on the\ninternational scene and to be more responsive to the\naspirations of this global village, it must earnestly\npursue its transformation and be more open to the\nworld and to itself.\nIt is also necessary to ensure greater democracy\nand fairness within the United Nations system, in\nparticular in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. The Security Council incontestably requires a\ndrastic reform of its processes and membership. In a\nword, the United Nations must serve the great family\nof mankind as a whole.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating Your Excellency, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\non your election as President of the General Assembly.\nI am especially gratified to be addressing the Assembly\nwhen a distinguished Asian is again at its helm.\nI congratulate as well His Excellency Mr. Kofi\nAnnan on the Nobel Prize that he, together with the\nUnited Nations, has received. That prize constitutes\nrecognition by the international community of the\nindispensable role of the United Nations and of the\nnecessary work it has done on the Secretary-General\u2019s\nwatch towards world peace and justice.\nAt the most elemental level, we feel most deeply\nthe sad and tragic impact of the recent inhuman acts of\nterrorism: the lost lives, the orphaned children, the\nwidowed spouses, the parents struck with the\nunimaginable grief of outliving their children and,\nworse yet, of watching them die. As we watched the\nhorror unfold, we felt as though it were happening to\nus \u2014 as indeed it was, for the United Nations is in a\nsense one family. The blow that was struck at this\ninternational city of New York was felt as directly by\nthe rest of the world. As people the world over stopped\nto watch in horror as the twin towers came down, the\nworld\u2019s economies ground to a virtual halt.\nBusiness activity stopped, investments were\nwithdrawn, markets shrank, tourism dried up, more\njobs were lost, living standards dropped even further,\ndestitution spread and the very conditions that favour\nterrorism spread and deepened. Our misgivings about a\nworld slowdown deepened into certainty about a\nrecession that will be felt most deeply by those least\nable to endure it: not just classes but whole countries.\nThe average growth rate in the gross domestic product\nof developing countries could fall from last year\u2019s 5.5\nper cent to 2.9 per cent. For most poor countries, that\nwill translate to sub-zero growth.\nThe face of terrorism that this city saw over a\nmonth ago is a familiar one to Asians. It has taken a\nterrible toll in terms of the lives of our people and the\neconomies of the region. It has destroyed our credit and\nhas deterred investment. It has caused Asian\nGovernments profound embarrassment at being caught\nflat-footed and unable to offer their citizens the most\nbasic security. In the south-western part of the\nPhilippines, it has taxed our resources and our patience\nto the limit, for terrorism is the argument of those who\nare not really interested in reasoning but only in getting\nwhatever they want on their terms alone.\nWe know terrorism. We are fighting it in the\nsouth-western Philippines. The perpetrators of the first\nattack on the World Trade Center were apprehended by\nour police. Rather than dismembering our country and\ndispossessing our people of their homes, we have been\nnegotiating with secessionist groups. But we have\nthrown the full weight of the law, including the use of\nforce, at those who have resorted to terrorism. We\nknow the enemy, and we know that these are not people\nyou talk to; these are people you fight. As the\nSecretary-General has pointed out, there are those who\nwill hate and who will kill even if every injustice is\nended. You must fight them in the field, when they take\nto the field and hunt them in cities when they hide\ninside.\nIt was in the light of that experience in the south-\nwestern Philippines that we immediately condemned\nthe terrorist attacks on the United States, for we\nrecognized them immediately as desperate and\ndespicable acts by that violent minority which seeks to\nenslave the world with fear. And indeed, they have\ngiven the world good reason to be afraid. The attack on\nthe World Trade Center, which aimed to take the lives\nof the 50,000 people who worked inside it, shows us an\nenemy without pity, without compunction and prepared\nto use any means to achieve the greatest destruction.\nThe Philippines did not need to join the war on\nterrorism: it was in that war already, in the south-\nwestern part of our islands. The Philippines could not\nhave done otherwise than to renew its commitment to\nfight terrorism in a wider field in the wake of 11\nSeptember. We know that this is an enemy that must be\n9\n\nfought everywhere so that it cannot again strike at will\nanywhere it pleases.\nThis is a fight between tolerance and bigotry,\nbetween reason and fanaticism, between law and\nanarchy, between justice and murder pretending to be\njust. In this fight, there is no side to choose but the one\nwhere the civilized nations of the world \u2014 long-time\nallies and former enemies \u2014 have chosen to stand\nunited, not least here in this Hall.\nThe Secretary-General has declared that the 11\nSeptember attacks struck at everything our\nOrganization stands for: peace, freedom, tolerance,\nhuman rights, and the very idea of a united human\nfamily.\nI do not know if the future belongs to our side,\nbut I am convinced that there will be no future if our\nside does not prevail in this fight \u2014 at least, no future\nthat any of us would care to live in. In fact, it would\nnot be a future in which most of us would be allowed\nto live. It would be a future where happiness was\nsuspect, delight was blasphemy, beauty was a cause for\nshame and independent thought a capital crime.\nBut while terrorism cannot be placated, and no\nterrorist should be appeased, there is no doubt in our\nminds, either, that we must address the concerns that\nthey pretend are the inspiration for their terrible deeds.\nIf the world can show that it will carry on, that it\nwill persevere in creating a stronger, more just, more\nbenevolent and more genuine international community\nacross all lines of religion and race, then terrorism will\nhave failed.\nNo, terrorism will not stop, but it will have failed.\nTo stop terrorism, the terrorists themselves will have to\nbe stopped. What we can do, however, is to strip them\nof their moral pretensions and take upon ourselves the\ncauses that they have perverted.\nNo nation will indefinitely endure the yawning\ngap between rich and poor \u2014 a gap that is only\ngrowing bigger, not just within, but across the\ncountries of the world. It is this growing disparity\nbetween the ever fewer rich and the ever-increasing\npoor that has given terrorism the freedom of movement\nand impunity from accountability that it has enjoyed.\nPoverty can be reduced partly by national\neconomic growth. But, more than that, societies have to\nadopt deliberate policies to ensure that the income\nlevels of the poor rise faster than those of the rich.\nRecent developments in the global economy have\ndisplayed the perils of overdependence on external\nmarkets. We must expand domestic demand and\nincrease the purchasing power of the masses of our\npeople.\nThis is largely the responsibility of each nation.\nWe in the Philippines are addressing the affront of\nmass poverty through housing, education, lower\nmedical costs, more efficient power, transportation and\ncommunications, infrastructure in the countryside,\ncredit to small farmers and micro-industries,\nproductivity, protection of the environment, and\ndevelopment of the areas farthest from our centre of\npolitical power and economic activity.\nThe international community also has a\nresponsibility in the elimination of poverty.\nCommitments to devote a certain percentage of gross\ndomestic product to official development assistance\nhave a place. But the most effective, and least costly,\nanti-poverty measure on a global scale is for developed\ncountries to open their markets wider to the products of\nthe developing countries, including in particular those\nproducts turned out by poor people in the poor\ncountries \u2014 agricultural commodities, textiles,\nclothing and footwear, as well as electrical and\nelectronic appliances and components.\nThe global trading system cannot allow\ndeveloped countries to subsidize heavily their\nagricultural exports while the developing countries are\nwithout the means to help their own farmers.\nThe recent Ministerial Meeting of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) decided to launch a new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations. To ensure that\nthe WTO does not lose credibility at this crucial time,\nour top priority is to ensure that the Doha round is truly\na development round.\nThe effort to conquer poverty must embrace all\ncultures, all ethnic groups and all religious\ncommunities. Nations must allow all to preserve their\nown cultures.\nWe must make political autonomy accessible to\nregions that want it. At the same time, no one must be\nallowed to resort to terrorism to further political aims.\n10\n\nRespect for culture and religion, resources for\ndevelopment, openness to political autonomy within\nthe sovereignty of the nation and rejection of terrorism\nare the foundations of the Philippine approach to our\nethnic diversity and to the uplifting of our Muslim and\ntribal minorities.\nThe vision of nations where poverty is rapidly\nreduced cannot be attained in places where women and\ngirls are mistreated and their rights trampled upon. As\na woman head of State, woman head of Government\nand woman Commander-in-Chief of the world\u2019s\nfourteenth largest nation, I say: we cannot conquer\npoverty without liberating women and girls where they\nare oppressed. The gender gap is a part of the\ndevelopment gap and must be addressed with equal\nvigour.\nThe fight against terrorism, the struggle to\neliminate poverty, the work on behalf of social and\ninternational justice, the strengthening of the rule of\nlaw, the promotion of tolerance and mutual respect, the\npractice of humanitarian compassion, the liberation of\nwomen, the never-ending quest for peace \u2014 these have\nlong been on the United Nations agenda. We in the\nPhilippines have been doing this in our region, in\ncooperation with our neighbours.\nThe heightened virulence of terrorism, the\nrenewed sense of insecurity among the world\u2019s peoples\nand the alarming slowdown in the global economy\nhave intensified the urgency and importance of our\nwork. Together, let us get on with the job. It is serious.\nIt is essential. It is urgent.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe have just learned\nof the crash of an American Airlines plane in New\nYork. We the Polish delegation, offer our heartfelt\ncondolences, and express our sympathy to the\nGovernment of the United States and the Dominican\nRepublic and to the families of the victims of this\ntragedy.\nAt the outset, let me offer Mr. Han my sincere\ncongratulations on his election to the prestigious office\nof the President of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. The delegation of the Republic of Poland\nextends to him its firm support in his demanding\nmandate.\nLet me likewise express to the former President,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, of Finland, our appreciation for his\nremarkable leadership, which he brought to the fifty-\nfifth session of the Assembly.\nI should also like to convey to Mr. Kofi Annan,\nthe distinguished Secretary-General, my sincere\ngreetings, and to say how pleased Poland is at his\nsecond term in that high post. May I also take this\nopportunity to renew to him, and indeed to this\nOrganization as a whole, my Government's\ncongratulations on the recent Nobel Peace Prize. The\naward comes as a timely token of appreciation of the\nway the United Nations and the Secretary-General have\nbeen meeting their formidable challenge.\nThe appalling tragedy of 11 September calls for\nresolute reaction of the entire international community,\nfor active solidarity with the United States and for\neffective counter-measures against those who sow\ndeath, hatred and terror.\nThe terrorist attack of 11 September, the way it\ncame about and the circumstances by which it was\nconditioned should be seized by the international\ncommunity as an occasion for an in-depth reassessment\nof the very foundations of the international order.\nPreoccupied as we are with ever-new developments\neach day, we tend to be mentally incapable of\nfollowing signals that predict new trends in\ninternational relations. We have hardly been able to\nafford the time for searching reflection on, and\nadjustment to, negative phenomena that, if ignored,\ncan, in time, become the breeding ground for upheavals\nand conflicts. In this era of enormous new challenges,\nit is time for creative thinking, vision and intellectual\ncourage.\nThe essence of security has changed dramatically.\nIn Poland's view, all aspects of security need urgent,\nthorough and imaginative reassessment. In this context\nparticularly searching reflection must be focused on the\nrole of the State  an entity that operates in entirely\nnew circumstances in an era of dramatically increasing\nintegration, globalization and fragmentation. This is a\ntime of interdependence and multiculturalism, in which\nopenness, close international cooperation and\ninteraction should be seen as countermeasures against\ndiverse processes of fragmentation and disintegration,\nwhich can lead us even further towards the nationalism,\nseparatism, closure and isolation that loom all around.\nFragmentation is creating instability and conflicts. And\n7\n\nthe most dangerous fragmentation process of the\ncurrent era is being generated by the widening\ndevelopment gap between regions and States, which\nhas been so well attested and documented by many\nUnited Nations publications. In this, the role of the\nUnited Nations is particularly fundamental and crucial.\nThere is no better-equipped and more universal forum\nto deal with those issues.\nAt the Headquarters of an Organization which the\npeoples of the United Nations established 56 years ago\nin order to maintain international peace and security,\nthat axiom should be self-evident. The whole world is\ntrying to respond to the challenges of globalization, the\nnew scientific revolution, and  quite recently  the\ndestabilizing forces of terror. The United Nations\nshould find adequate answers to those challenges. This\nis a time for collective and resolute action.\nPerhaps as ominous as terrorism itself is the fact\nthat in some countries, the monstrous acts of violence\nthat have taken place have been met with some\nsympathy on the part of those who are destitute,\ndeprived of any hope, and who, driven to the margins\nof social life, have become frustrated and desperate.\nTerrorists must never be exculpated or their\nactions justified. We need to do away with the reasons\nwhy many perceive terrorists as present-day Robin\nHoods. Though such a perception can be described as\ngroundless, this does not release us from our\nresponsibility to take a careful and courageous look at\nthe phenomena that are emerging in the present\ninternational order, which tend to consolidate\ninequalities and lead to various social calamities.\nFrom the very beginning, Poland has proclaimed\nitself entirely on the side of the international anti-\nterrorist coalition. We are working seriously and\ndiligently on the implementation of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001).\nRegional undertakings can make a significant\ncontribution to drafting a global strategy for the\nstruggle against terrorism. With that in mind, last week\nin Warsaw we organized a very successful international\nConference on Combating Terrorism. The Conference\nwas attended by representatives of 17 Central\nEuropean, Baltic and Balkan States, including 13\nPresidents. The Conference also provided a direct\nconnection with the White House and President Bush,\nwho had the opportunity to talk directly with the\nConference's participants. The declaration adopted by\nthe Conference indicates a strong political commitment\nto fight against that plague at the dawn of the twenty-\nfirst century, in close collaboration with the United\nStates and the entire international community.\nThe plan of action adopted at that Conference\nspells out concrete measures. It is significant that the\nleaders of that region of Europe gave unanimous\nbacking to the relevant actions of the United Nations,\nthe European Union and other organizations.\nIn the course of Poland's very complicated\nhistory, my nation has on several occasions been\nbetrayed by disloyal neighbours and allies and has paid\nthe highest price for this. Therefore we understand\nbetter than anyone how priceless and crucial true\nloyalty and alliances are. Thus we will continue to\nsupport our friends and allies by all available means.\nOur principal goal at present is to ease peoples' fears -\nfears that have been imposed on them by the enemies\nof mankind.\nThe horrible scenario in which public order and\nthe safety of peoples is threatened, passenger planes\nhijacked and destroyed, deadly viruses spread and\nwater poisoned must not be repeated. We must defeat\nthose who participate in, or contribute to creating, such\na threat. Our approach must be a comprehensive one.\nLet me make it clear: there is no room for any\nselectivity, flexibility or relativism when the most\nfundamental values of humankind are openly and\nfuriously attacked.\nHowever, we need to reconsider our position on\nhow to respond to the needs of those millions who\nevery day suffer from hunger, disease and a lack of\nclean water. For them, the same question arises every\nmorning  a question that sounds like the classical\nphrase to be or not to be. That question is how to\nsurvive. Extreme poverty deprives people of their\ninherent dignity and human rights and of their chance\nfor a better tomorrow, thus pushing them to take\ndesperate steps.\nLet the tragedy of 11 September teach all of us to\ncollectively combat evil. Let us do everything to ensure\nthat the forces of darkness never prevail.\nIn the course of the last few years it has been\neloquently argued, from this very rostrum, that\nglobalization is a very positive force which will\nultimately usher in an era of prosperity and stability\nand a global society. Alas, this has not happened.\n8\n\nThis calls for a new approach to international\ncooperation, for a new role on the part of multilateral\ninstitutions, and for the restoration of the primacy of\ncourageous political decisions and intergovernmental\naccords. This also calls, on the one hand, for greater\nmoderation on the part of the strong and the rich, and,\non the other, for more determined endeavours on the\npart of the weak and the poor, who must be convinced\nthat their consistent aspirations to improve their own\nlot will ultimately pay off. In my opinion, the\npromotion of democracy and good governance offers\none of the most important paths towards such a goal.\nPoland's own experience in the past 12 years, since the\nhistoric transformations of 1989, testifies to the merits\nof that path.\nIt is my Government's firm view that, in the face\nof the threats which will forever be symbolized by the\natrocities of 11 September, the interests of international\nsecurity would be well served by the earliest possible\nsignature and ratification of, or adherence to, the\nmultilateral conventions against terrorism which have\nbeen elaborated under the auspices of the United\nNations. In particular, the spreading anthrax scare,\nwhich represents but the tip of the iceberg when it\ncomes to the potential danger of bioterrorism, and the\nspreading of fissile materials and chemical weapons are\na powerful argument for the urgent need to strengthen\nand strictly enforce the Biological Weapons\nConvention of 1972 and other legal instruments in this\nfield.\nWe should immediately move  to quote the\nSecretary-General  from a culture of reaction to a\nculture of prevention.\nWhile imperative, the struggle against terrorism\nmust not obscure the necessity for the United Nations\nto effectively discharge the mandate entrusted to it by\nthe international community  a mandate whose scope\nis expanding over the years. This is not only true with\nrespect to the international security problems which I\nhave just referred to, but also concerns problems\nrelated to socio-economic cooperation, the protection\nof human rights and humanitarian issues, particularly\nthose concerning refugees and the protection of the\nenvironment.\nAlso of major importance, in our view, is the\nelaboration and adoption of a package of regulations\nand commitments in respect of development aid,\nindebtedness and trade. Thus I wish to emphasize the\nimportance of the full implementation of the set of\nprinciples and practical measures embodied in the\nMillennium Declaration. We are mindful, of course,\nthat the translation of that programme into practical\nsteps cannot be the responsibility of the United Nations\nalone. It is essential for other institutions and\norganizations, including financial, trade and regional\nones, to help in that effort. Above all, individual States\nmust become directly involved, otherwise the smooth\nand timely implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration could be seriously jeopardized.\nThe United Nations is now facing enormous and\nunprecedented challenges. These challenges \u00f1 arising\nas they do at the dawn of the new millennium - mean\ngrowing divisions and, indeed, pose a risk of\nfragmentation of the international community.\nMy country, Poland, is ready to be an active\nparticipant in the process of searching for a new role\nfor the United Nations. We have been active throughout\nthe entire history of the United Nations, and we want to\nbe active in the immediate future as well."

        "file_text": "\ufeffEvery speaker\nfrom this podium during the special debate on\nterrorism, the debate on dialogue among civilizations\nand our current general debate has said, suggested or\nimplied that 11 September has changed the world\nirrevocably. Indeed it has. A democracy is an open\nsociety. Movement is free. Speech is free. All the\ncitizens of a democratic society are free to lead their\nlives in freedom, subject only to the rule of law. Fear\nand the spirit of democratic freedom are two totally\nopposite states of mind. Yet, today, fear stalks the\nUnited States of America, where democracy has\nflourished vigorously for so long, bringing prosperity\nto its people and taking human achievement to\nunimagined heights of excellence.\nThere can be no argument that terror in all its\nmanifestations must be fought relentlessly and\nglobally. Gone are the days when a country affected by\nterror, as my country has been for two decades, can be\ntold by the international community, \u201cWe are sorry\nabout what is happening in your land, but there is\nnothing we can do to help you because we have no\nlaws to combat terror.\u201d When our Central Bank was\nbombed and destroyed, when the Temple of the Sacred\nTooth Relic, one of the holiest shrines of Buddhism,\nwas bombed and saved from destruction only by a\nmiracle, when a commuter train carrying workers home\nwas attacked with explosives, when thousands of\npeople, including monks, women and children were\nslaughtered, when Muslims were massacred in a\nmosque while at prayer, when a President of Sri Lanka,\nMinisters and Members of Parliament and many other\nelected leaders were assassinated, let alone a Prime\nMinister of India, when a suicide bomber at an election\nrally attacked the incumbent President of Sri Lanka,\nkilling and wounding scores of innocent bystanders and\ngrievously wounding her in the right eye, the sight of\nwhich was lost \u2014 all this and much more has happened\nat the hands of a terrorist group in Sri Lanka \u2014 we\nreceived merely sympathies, condolences, expressions\nof shock and outrage, while the funding that fuels the\nterrorism in my country went on apace in the great,\nliberal democracies of the West. When half of the\naircraft in our national airline were damaged or\ndestroyed by those same terrorists on 24 July, we were\nadvised by some Governments to negotiate. We were\nreminded that \u201cviolence begets violence\u201d.\nThat approach has changed dramatically in recent\ndays, or so it seems, because terrorism has assailed the\nnational interests of many countries. Terrorism is no\nlonger the curse of the poor. Now, more than ever\nbefore, when a terrorist attack takes place somewhere\nin the world, \u201cnever send to know for whom the bell\ntolls\u201d, as John Donne said nearly four centuries ago,\nfor surely \u201cit tolls for thee\u201d.\nThe United Nations has focused sharply on\nbuilding consensus to fight terror. Two important\nUnited Nations conventions were adopted with\nadmirable speed \u2014 the International Convention for\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\n24\n\nFinancing of Terrorism. Another important convention\nis being considered at this session by the Ad Hoc\nCommittee on International Terrorism, which is chaired\nby Sri Lanka. Since we have been so severely affected\nby terrorism, it is only natural that we should play a\nleading role in designing the legislation that the\ninternational community should adopt and implement\nto combat terrorism.\nThere is a particularly abhorrent brand of\nterrorism that the world can never condone \u2014 that is,\nthe forcible conscription of young children for battle,\nwidely practiced by the terrorists of Sri Lanka and well\ndocumented by Amnesty International, the United\nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children\nand Armed Conflict. It would be a permanent blot on\nhumankind\u2019s conscience if these poor children were to\nbe consigned, unnoticed and uncared for, to their\nmiserable fate.\nWhile terrorism must continue to be fought,\nrelentlessly and by everyone everywhere, sooner rather\nthan later the international community will have to\nfocus its collective attention on the question of\nanalysing and diagnosing the causes of terrorism,\npreventing and finally eliminating it before it becomes\na problem of such deadly dimensions that it threatens\nthe whole world. The causes of terrorism cannot be\nignored. To examine the roots of terrorism and the\nculture in which it breeds in a systematic, objective,\nwell-informed manner is not, by any means, to yield to\nterrorism. It is not a manifestation of weakness for the\ninternational community to examine the root causes of\nterrorism. It is axiomatic that a contented people do not\nrise up to destroy the society in which they live. If the\nworld has become a village, surely we must take care\nto ensure that the villagers living down one road in the\nvillage are not given cause to become resentful and\nangry at the opulence enjoyed by other villagers living\ndown another road, only a stone\u2019s throw away.\nMight I suggest, therefore, that this General\nAssembly consider the convening of an international\ngroup of eminent persons with the appropriate\nbackgrounds in all relevant fields, representative of all\nregions of the world, appointed by the President of the\nGeneral Assembly, the President of the Security\nCouncil and the Secretary-General, with the request\nthat the group report to the General Assembly, the\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General within an\nappropriate time frame on terrorism and its prevention.\nThus, inescapably we will have to revisit and re-\naddress the old questions that have haunted the United\nNations ever since it was born \u2014 that is, the questions\nof poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance and injustice.\nThese questions have been with us for a long time.\nThey have received answers which are, to a large\nextent, no more than faint-hearted attempts to forge\nsolutions that look grand on paper but are incapable of\nimplementation due to the lack of funds and the lack of\npolitical will.\nThe formulation of policy has always been far\neasier than its implementation and, when we look to\nthe future through the ultimate prism \u2014 namely, the\nfunding available \u2014 we face once more the bitter truth\nof which our colleagues from the developed world have\nbeen warning us year after year: \u201cthe funding globally\navailable is far from promising\u201d.\nWe in the developing world have also been\nwarning our colleagues for so long, when a developing\ncountry is unable to generate a sufficient amount of\ndomestic capital, public or private, it is to international\ncapital that we, in the developing world, have to turn;\nand, as international private capital is sensitive to the\nrate and continuance of profitable return, it is only\nofficial development assistance (ODA) that remains.\nOn 8 November, only a few days ago, at the\nEuropean Union\u2019s (EU) Development Council in\nBrussels, a common statement was delivered by the\nfive Ministers for Development Cooperation of\nDenmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and\nSweden. Their words convey far more effectively, and\nwith far greater authority, than my words could\npossibly do, the thoughts of developing countries on\nthe question of development aid, and, therefore, I take\nthe liberty of quoting that common statement in its\nentirety:\n\u201cIn the Millennium Declaration, the\ninternational community recognized the fight\nagainst poverty as the greatest challenge to our\nglobal governance system\u201d.\n\u201cThe events of 11 September have made it\neven more crucial to deal with these problems.\nWe not only need a global coalition against\nterrorism. We need a global coalition against\npoverty as well.\n\u201cThe Secretary-General of the United\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, at the Conference on\n25\n\nthe Least Developed Countries in May 2001,\nremarked that only a few countries have lived up\nto the goals of devoting 0.7 percent of their gross\nnational product (GNP) to official development\nassistance (ODA), and that the least developed\ncountries suffer disproportionately as a result of\nthat.\n\u201cWe need better and more effective\ndevelopment assistance: policy coherence, lower\ntransaction costs by harmonization of procedures.\nWe need sharper focus on the importance of\nstrong institutions and sound economic and social\npolicy. But we cannot expect to reach our\ncommon goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015\nwithout increasing aid volume.\u201d\nI continue to quote from the common statement:\n\u201cThere is no need for a new set of standards.\nAll United Nations members, with the exception\nof the United States, have accepted a long\nestablished standard volume of ODA for donor\ncountries: 0.7 percent of GNP. But the\ninternational community is still a long way from\nmaking this standard a reality.\n\u201cAlthough the EU has stressed the\nimportance of the 0.7 percent target in the\nconclusions of the European Council in G\u00f6teborg,\nthe EU\u2019s record is no exception: in 2000, member\nStates gave an average of only 0.33 per cent of\nGNP in ODA. This is better than the OECD\naverage of 0.24 per cent, but it is still a long way\nfrom the target.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark\nand Luxembourg are the only EU member States\nthat meet the ODA standard. Norway, a non-EU\nmember, is also part of this exclusive club.\nLuxembourg, the newest member of this group,\nhas proved that it is possible to raise ODA to 0.7\nper cent of GNP in a short period of time.\nTogether we make up the G-0.7.\n\u201cThe G-7 is full of promises. If all the rich\ncountries would just implement what they have\ncommitted themselves to, as the G-0.7 have done,\nwe would not encounter these financial\nconstraints. Having said that, we do realize that\nODA is not the only way forward. We also must\ntake into account fair distribution of resources,\ndebt relief, open markets, good governance and\nthe role of the private sector. A reform of the\nCommon Agricultural Policy is a great challenge\nto the EU.\n\u201cWe welcome new and innovative financing\noptions, but the main problem is that some\ncountries are not providing adequate ODA\nresources. Obviously there is a lack of political\ncommitment in setting budget priorities. These\ncountries need to change their political priorities\nin order to comply with their international\ncommitments.\n\u201cEU Declarations like the one made in\nG\u00f6teborg do call for that much needed\ncompliance \u2014 that is to say, they call on us to\nkeep the promises we have already made \u2014 but\nthey do so only in general terms. We now need to\npick up the pace.\n\u201cWe call on EU members to make a firm\ncommitment at the International Conference on\nFinance for Development in Monterrey in 2002\nand to formulate individual plans and timetables\nin order to make concrete progress in reaching the\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of GNP to ODA.\n\u201cToday\u2019s EU Development Council in\nBrussels is a good opportunity to further\nstrengthen the relations in our global world. It\nshould send a long awaited signal that we are\nserious about our commitments to developing\ncountries.\u201d\nI wish to place on record the high appreciation of\nmy Government to the Governments of Denmark,\nLuxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden for\nthose frank and refreshing observations.\nWe in the developing world will certainly look\nwith much expectation to the International Conference\non Financing for Development that will convene in\nMarch next year. We cannot but hope that,\nnotwithstanding the continuing difference in positions,\na secure foundation for a partnership for the future will\nbe formed there, within which both the strong interests\nof the developing world and the strong concerns of the\ndeveloped world can be adequately accommodated.\nAnd I would think that undoubtedly the\ndeveloped world too will, after the events of 11\nSeptember, look to the future with a frame of mind\ndifferent from its frame of mind before that fateful\ndate. Development, stability and contentment for all\n26\n\npeople are no longer charitable objectives. They are in\nthe self-interest of all.\nMost certainly, neither we in the developing\nworld nor those in the developed world can allow\nabject, desperate poverty, without any hope of a better\nfuture, to become a fertile field for those who wish to\nfan the flames of discord and hate and make it their\nbusiness to wreak death, destruction, terror and\nmayhem.\nFifty-six years ago almost to this day, the\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization was proclaimed in\nwords that have a prophetic resonance today:\n\u201c... since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in\nthe minds of men that the defences of peace must\nbe constructed;\n\u201c... ignorance of each other\u2019s ways and lives has\nbeen a common cause, throughout the history of\nmankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between\nthe peoples of the world through which their\ndifferences have all too often broken into war;\n\u201c... the great and terrible war which has now\nended was a war made possible by the denial of\nthe democratic principles of the dignity, equality\nand mutual respect of men, and by the\npropagation, in their place, through ignorance and\nprejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men\nand races;\n\u201c... a peace based exclusively upon the political\nand economic arrangements of governments\nwould not be a peace which could secure the\nunanimous, lasting and sincere support of the\npeoples of the world, and...the peace must\ntherefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the\nintellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.\u201d\nThese are noble words of timeless quality. But\nwords, however noble, which remain untranslated into\ndeeds become shallow, tawdry, degraded.\nAll nations, all the peoples of the world, must\nrealize that we are slipping into a crisis of a kind we\nhave never encountered before. The spectres of fear,\ndoubt, uncertainty, mistrust and suspicion stalk the\nworld. The hour is late. The hour is grave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you, Sir,\nonce again on your election as President of the fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to\nexpress high appreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri, who\ncarried out his duties as President of the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly in an excellent\nmanner. I would like to take this opportunity to extend\nwarm congratulations again to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\nre-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nLast year, heads of State and Government\nthroughout the world held the Millennium Summit in\n33\n\nthis Hall and committed themselves to building a\npeaceful and prosperous world in the new century. That\ngave high hope and expectations to all people of the\nworld. However, the developments that are now taking\nplace on the globe overshadow possible\nimplementation of the Millennium Summit\ncommitments. The principles of respect for national\nsovereignty and equality that constitute a cornerstone\nof international relations are being undermined by\ncertain forces that consider strength as the means to\nachieve everything. As long as there is acquiescence to\nacts of arbitrary power that seek to destroy strategic\nstability and hold absolute supremacy by establishing a\nmissile defence system in defiance of international\nopposition, the world will be engulfed in another cold\nwar and arms race.\nThe problem of the Korean peninsula always\ncomes up as one of the major issues in deliberations on\nglobal peace and security. That is because of the power\npolicy and arbitrary actions directed in most cases\nagainst the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. We\nare exposed to constant threats from huge armed\nforces, including nuclear weapons, deployed around the\nKorean peninsula on the pretext of an alleged threat\nfrom North Korea, and that is the main source of\ninstability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-\nPacific region. That notwithstanding, we have been\nable firmly to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the\ncountry on our own in the face of the offensive by\nhostile forces, and under difficult conditions\nresembling an arduous march, unprecedented in our\nhistory, thus contributing to the peace and security of\nthe region. That is entirely attributable to the\noutstanding army-first policies of the respected General\nKim Jong Il. The great leader General Kim Jong Il\nconducted active diplomacy, including his visit to\nChina and Russia and his meeting with the top-level\ndelegation of the European Union this year, and thus\nmade a great contribution to developing overall\ninternational relations and strengthening global peace\nand security.\nIn particular, the summit meetings and talks\nbetween the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\nand Russia and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and China resulted in the adoption of documents\nreflecting shared views on strengthening the leading\nrole of the United Nations in resolving major\ninternational issues, ensuring strategic balance, and so\non. This serves as an historic milestone in establishing\na fair, new world, based on the principles of mutual\nrespect and cooperation for mutual benefit. We will, as\never, firmly defend our sovereignty and the socialist\nsystem of our country and advance convincingly along\nthe road chosen by ourselves under the army-first\nleadership of the respected General Kim Jong Il.\nIt is the unanimous desire of all Korean people to\nreunify the divided country at the earliest possible date.\nLast year, the inter-Korean summit meeting was held\nand the North-South Joint Declaration issued for the\nfirst time in the history of the national division, thanks\nto the idea of national independence and great national\nunity of the great leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il. The\nJoint Declaration reflects the will and aspirations of the\nKorean people to achieve reunification independently\nby pooling the efforts of the nation. It enjoys wide\nsupport and is welcomed by the international\ncommunity. The General Assembly, at its fifty-fifth\nsession, unanimously adopted the resolution supporting\nthe Joint Declaration. With the publication of the Joint\nDeclaration, the enthusiasm for reunification was\nmanifested throughout the Korean peninsula and\ndialogues and contacts in various fields took place\nbetween the North and the South of Korea. It\ndemonstrated that the Korean nation could well open\nthe door to reunification by itself, if the North and the\nSouth make joint efforts with sincere will for\nindependent reunification. However, inter-Korean\nrelations and the implementation of the 15 June Joint\nDeclaration, which were proceeding well and in the\nright direction, now face a big obstacle due to the hard-\nline, hostile policy and unjust interference of the new\nUnited States Administration against the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nThe half-century history of national division and,\nin particular, experiences during the past year, clearly\nshow that the North and South of Korea should, above\nall, adhere to a stance of national independence if they\nare to implement the North-South Joint Declaration.\nOnly when the North and South collaborate as one\nnation will they open up a bright future for the nation,\nwithout becoming a victim of outside forces. The most\nimportant element in implementing the North-South\nJoint Declaration and achieving peace and reunification\non the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the hostile\npolicy and interference of the United States against the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. It is totally\nirrational to say that the United States deploys huge\narmed forces in and around the Korean peninsula and\n34\n\nconducts large-scale military exercises against us to\nadvance peace, self-defensive measures taken by my\ncountry to cope with the United States military threat is\na threat to peace. Our missile programme is of a purely\npeaceful nature and does not pose a threat to any\ncountry that respects the sovereignty of the Democratic\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nIt makes no sense for the United States to argue\nthat it needs to establish a missile defence system out\nof fear of our missiles while itself possessing\nthousands of nuclear bombs and missiles that could\nextinguish humankind many times over. That argument\nonly covers up the United States strategy to gain\ndomination of the world, based on superior power.\nSince the cold war is over and the North and South of\nKorea are proceeding towards reconciliation and\ncooperation in accordance with the 15 June Joint\nDeclaration, there is neither reason nor any other\nground whatsoever for United States troops to remain\nin the South of Korea. Withdrawal of United States\ntroops from South Korea is an urgent issue whose\nsolution should not brook any further delay in the\ninterest of ensuring peace and security on the Korean\npeninsula and in North-East Asia. Dialogue should be\nconducted on a fair and equal basis. Resumption of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea-United States\nof America dialogue will only be possible when the\npresent United States Administration gets rid of its\ncold-war mentality and adopts a stance at least at the\nlevel of the one taken by the Clinton Administration in\nthe last period of its term of office.\nDuring the past two years, we have established\nofficial relations with almost all member States of the\nEuropean Union (EU) and diplomatic relations with the\nEU itself, and countries of other regions as well, on the\nbasis of the principles of respect for sovereignty and\nequality. We are also ready to develop relations with\nthe United States on the principles of equality and\nmutual benefit if the United States respects our\nsovereignty and freedom of choice, takes an attitude of\ngood will towards us on an equal footing, and refrains\nfrom obstructing the reunification of Korea.\nAnother factor of instability that casts a dark\nshadow on the future development of the Korean\npeninsula and its surroundings is the orientation of\nJapanese moves, that is, the ultra-rightist inclination of\nJapan and its undisguised attempt to revive militarism.\nMy delegation wishes to draw the attention of all\nMember States to this matter at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly held in the first year of the twenty-\nfirst century. The Japanese authorities are not willing to\nterminate their past crimes against humanity, but try\ninstead to justify them, openly visiting the Yasukuni\nShrine, where the departed souls of the war criminals\nare enshrined, distorting history textbooks for new\ngenerations and legalizing the overseas advance of the\nJapanese self-defence force.\nOn 29 August, Japan test-fired an H-2A large-size\ndelivery rocket that could easily be converted into an\nintercontinental ballistic missile. That is a clear\nindication that the militarism of Japan has become\npoliticized and is proceeding to an open and dangerous\nstage.\nJapan, which has always stigmatized our peaceful\nsatellite launch as a missile launch, said openly that its\ntest-fire of the rocket was done to cope with North\nKorea\u2019s missile, thus invoking military confrontation.\nJapan should not misjudge our moratorium on satellite\nlaunches and the peaceful character of our missile\nprogramme. We strongly urge Japan to look squarely at\nreality; put an end to its past inhumane crimes, and\nsincerely turn to the road of peace in this new century.\nThat will be good for the future of Japan.\nThe most important task of Member States today\nis to strengthen the central role of the United Nations\nwith regard to international issues. It is essential that\nMember States honour and implement the United\nNations Charter in good faith. The United Nations\nCharter enshrines the purposes and principles for\ndeveloping friendly international relations on the basis\nof sovereign equality. However, certain countries do\nnot hesitate to undertake unilateral coercive actions and\neven resort to the use of force against sovereign States,\nignoring and violating the United Nations Charter.\nMember States should reject any attempt that goes\nagainst the United Nations Charter and other principles\nand norms of international law, and should strive to\nestablish a fair, new world structure based on the rule\nof law, equality, mutual respect and cooperation for\nmutual benefit, with a view to ensuring world security\nand stability. If the leading role of the United Nations\nin dealing with global issues is to be strengthened, the\nUnited Nations should be reformed in a democratic\nway. In this regard, we are of the view that it is\nessential to strengthen the authority of the General\nAssembly. The General Assembly must be empowered\nto consider issues relating to world peace and security\nand approve major resolutions of the Security Council\n35\n\non these issues. Reform of the Security Council should\nbe pursued in the context of strengthening the authority\nof the General Assembly. We hold that the Security\nCouncil reform should be undertaken in full conformity\nwith its intrinsic purpose. The Security Council reform\nmust ensure enough representation of the developing\ncountries and full fairness in United Nations activities\nfor achieving international peace and security. We\nplace on record our strong opposition to considering in\nany manner the permanent membership of Japan on the\nSecurity Council when it has neither put an end to nor\nrecognized its past crimes, and while no agreement has\nyet been reached on increasing the number of\npermanent members.\nOne of the major challenges to the United\nNations and its Member States today is global poverty,\nwhich grows ever more serious. Poverty, which has\nresulted from colonialism in the past, continues to be\naggravated due to the inequitable international\nmonetary systems and neo-colonial policies. It also\nbecomes a factor that begets conflicts, diseases and\nhunger and hampers the independent and creative life\nof peoples and their enjoyment of the right to\ndevelopment. If poverty is to be eradicated, a fair and\nequitable international economic order should be\nestablished and sustainable development ensured. We\nwill have to draw due lessons from the demonstrations\nin Genoa last July and properly handle the issue of\nglobalization. In this regard, it should be underlined\nthat the developed countries and the international\nfinancial institutions assume big responsibilities. The\nUnited Nations should encourage Member States to\ndirect their attention to considering more practical\nmeasures for eradicating poverty and achieving\ndevelopment.\nIt is the consistent and principled position of the\nGovernment of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea to oppose support, of whatever kind, to any\nforms of terrorism. The large-scale terrorist incident\nthat occurred in the United States on 11 September was\nvery regrettable and tragic and reminds us of the\ngravity of terrorism. The situation in Afghanistan is\nnow grave, where instability and unprecedented human\nloss and material damage are brought about by the\nmilitary operation of the United States. The prevailing\nsituation requires that the leading role of the United\nNations in preventing terrorism be definitely\nstrengthened and the national obligations for the\nelimination of terrorism be fully discharged by all\nMember States.\nYesterday we signed the International Convention\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and\nacceded to the International Convention against the\nTaking of Hostages. That shows that we are making\nevery possible effort to eliminate terrorism in the\nworld. As already stated, the aim of our opposing\nterrorism is to promote global peace and stability,\ndefend the sovereignty of the country and nation and\nprotect the lives and property of the peoples of the\nworld. We are strongly of the view that imposing the\nlabel of terrorist on countries that advocate sovereign\nequality, while violating their sovereignty and\ninflicting immeasurable pain on the people by resorting\nto arbitrary armed intervention, sanctions, and so on,\nshould in no way be tolerated. There is no justification\nin any case for the use of force or resorting to war and\ntaking innocent lives, undermining the situation and\ndestroying stability in the fight against terrorism.\nMy delegation wishes to reaffirm that the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will continue\nto cooperate fully with all Member States to uphold\nand implement the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter under the ideas of\nindependence, peace and friendship.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffA year after the unique Millennium Assembly,\nwe can say that the United Nations is playing an\nenhanced, more important role as a collective tool for\nmeeting the challenges facing the world.\nBulgaria welcomes the re-election of Mr. Kofi\nAnnan as Secretary-General, and hails the award of the\nNobel Peace Prize to him and to the Organization.\nInternational terrorism has become aggressive\nand powerful, and threatens not only States but also the\nfreedom of the human spirit, as proved by the world\nOrganization\u2019s committed and active stance vis-\u00e0-vis\nrecent terrorist acts, along with the unanimously\nadopted Security Council resolutions condemning\nthem. Bulgaria unequivocally supported those\nresolutions, in particular Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001). The National Assembly and the\nGovernment of Bulgaria have adopted similar\ndeclarations on ensuring a common effort in the fight\nagainst terrorism.\nLet me recall that the fight will be incomplete\nwithout moral \u2014 even spiritual \u2014 commitment. Let us\nnot forget that the mere pursuit of material well-being\nis not a panacea; other values are needed to improve\nthe lives of peoples. In a \u201cvirtual society\u201d, there is a\nneed for real values and for a framework acceptable to\nboth the poor and the rich.\nI take this opportunity to convey the condolences\nof the Bulgarian people to the citizens of the United\nStates of America with respect to the terrorist acts of\n11 September. We all admire the steadfastness and\ncourage they have displayed in addressing this tragedy\nand its aftermath.\n2\n\nI am particularly proud to observe that, at a time\nwhen the role and the importance of the United Nations\nare on the rise, the Republic of Bulgaria is about to\nassume the responsibilities of a non-permanent member\nof the Security Council. For the Bulgarian people and\nits Government, our election to that important organ of\nthe world Organization constitutes recognition of the\ninternational standing of Bulgaria and of its active,\nbalanced foreign policy. Our foreign policy\npriorities \u2014 membership of the European Union and of\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 are sounder\nthan ever before. For natural cultural reasons, we are\ncommitted to the concept of la francophonie, which\nembodies not merely a language but a state of mind. I\nthank all Member States that were good enough to\nsupport us in the election.\nBulgaria will shoulder the full responsibility of\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council.\nWe are ready to participate in dialogue on the full\nrange of items related to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. My country is open to\ndialogue with all States Members of the Organization and\nto ideas and suggestions aimed at enhancing the role\nand effectiveness of the United Nations.\nI wish here to speak of the positive part the\nRepublic of Bulgaria plays as an important actor for\npeace and security in South-Eastern Europe and for\nstability in the settlement of crises in the Eastern\nBalkans, an area that borders on Bulgaria. We favour\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999), and we consider that the 17 November\nelections in Kosovo will be decisive for the process of\nstabilization and democratization there. Similarly,\nBulgaria attaches high importance to ensuring the\nstability of the Republic of Macedonia through the\nimplementation of the 13 August 2001 Framework\nAgreement and to guaranteeing its sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity. My country supports full\nimplementation of the Dayton Accords and the\nconsolidation of the united State of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. In our view, democratization in the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia is a positive element. A\nlong-term strategy must be crafted to effect the\nrestoration and economic development of South-\nEastern Europe to rebuild it in the wake of the various\ncrises it has experienced. Let me stress that these\nquestions should continue to be the focus of all our\nefforts to find equitable solutions to conflicts.\nI should like also to highlight Bulgaria\u2019s support\nfor the lasting and peaceful settlement of other regional\nconflicts that are as tragic as those in the Middle East,\nin Africa and elsewhere, of which there is a long and\nsad list. Our positions in respect to all of these conflicts\nare in conformity with the Charter of the United\nNations and generally recognized principles of\ninternational law.\nHaving myself been an exile for more than 50\nyears, I am very aware of the human tragedy of\nrefugees, whose number and suffering are continuing to\nincrease, as is the case now in Afghanistan.\nWe attach great importance to items on the\nagenda of the United Nations such as the combat\nagainst organized crime and corruption and against\nillegal drug trafficking. That is why our Government is\nmaking a particular effort to this end on our own\nterritory. Monitoring trade in weapons and in dual-use\ngoods and technologies is highly relevant, given the\nlinkage between this kind of trade and terrorism.\nLet me add that Bulgaria is participating actively\nin cooperation efforts in the economic and social field\nand in the areas of human rights, the non-proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction, global disarmament\nand the protection of the environment. These objectives\nare consonant with those of the new Bulgarian\nGovernment: to ensure that the social needs of\nBulgarian citizens are met, and to bring about durable\neconomic growth, despite the sometimes difficult\ninternational economic situation.\nThe attitude of the Republic of Bulgaria vis-\u00e0-vis\nits increased responsibilities within this world\nOrganization will be based on a clear, logical and\nconsistent foreign policy, with an emphasis on regional\nsecurity, development and broadening the circle of\nfriendly States, and on making a contribution to the\nresolution of global problems through its active\nparticipation in multilateral dialogue. Solutions to\nconflicts must be found here, at the United Nations \u2014\nnot on the battlefield.\nIn conclusion, we believe that this policy will\nmeet with the understanding and support of all of the\nMembers of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow me\nwarmly to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of\nthe presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly.\nThis day, 11 November, is the anniversary of the\nArmistice which ended the slaughter of the First World\nWar and is a day of remembrance here in the United\nStates, in the United Kingdom and across much of the\nworld. It is a day when all of us remember the sacrifice\nof those who, over the last century, gave their lives that\nothers might live in freedom.\nFor our parents and grandparents, the end of the\nSecond World War stood as a turning point, a moment\nto establish a new world order. Their vision was\ninscribed at the very beginning of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations:\n\u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations,\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from\nthe scourge of war\u201d.\nWith these words, they founded the international\ncommunity.\nFor some of us, the subsequent half-century has\nbeen the most peaceful era of our history. Yet we know\nthat no one\u2019s freedom can be secure while others suffer.\nOn this Remembrance Day, we remember\nsomething else \u2014 the thousands who died just two\nmonths ago, on 11 September. A third of the nations\nrepresented here in the General Assembly lost citizens\nat the World Trade Center. But just as our predecessors\nsaw hope in the midst of despair, so we now face the\ntask of building a new and better world.\nIt is fitting that it was here at the United Nations,\non 12 September, that the world began to fight back\nagainst the terrorist threat. We showed our joint\nresolve, in the Security Council and in the General\nAssembly, when we adopted resolutions demanding\nthat terrorists and those who harbour them be held to\naccount for their evil actions.\nI applaud Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), which established the Counter-terrorism\nCommittee and which requires all Member States to\nrespond to the global terrorist threat.\n21\n\nWe do surely have to take every effective\nmeasure against international terrorist networks, whose\nmalign influence is felt in every part of the globe, not\nleast by adopting a comprehensive convention on\nterrorism and the draft Nuclear Terrorism Convention.\nWe also have to confront an unpalatable truth:\nthat we still face a real and immediate danger. The\nmurderous groups who plotted the terrible events of 11\nSeptember could strike again at any time. Thus our first\nduty, to our citizens and to each other, is to defend\nourselves against that threat.\nWhen the nations of the world agreed the United\nNations Charter, they recognized the right of self-\ndefence in Article 51. It is in exercise of this right that\nthe military coalition is now engaged in action against\nAl Qaeda and the Taliban regime which harbours them.\nTaking military action is always a tough decision.\nBut here it truly was unavoidable, and we all owe a\ndebt of gratitude to President Bush for the steadfast and\ncareful manner in which the United States proceeded.\nBut in defending the world from terror, we have\nto do our utmost to spare innocent Afghan people\nfurther suffering. For decades, the Afghans have seen\ntheir country exploited by outside powers and riven by\nconflict. In five years, their society has been\nsystematically destroyed by one of the most brutal\nregimes the world has ever known.\nBut at last today, the international community is\nunited in its efforts to feed and shelter the millions of\nrefugees through this harsh winter, and it is determined\nto help build a new Afghanistan.\nFor the first time in decades, there is consensus in\nthe Security Council as a whole, and among\nAfghanistan\u2019s neighbours, that there should be a broad-\nbased government in Kabul, reflecting Afghanistan\u2019s\nrich ethnic diversity, and that the future of Afghanistan\nmust be put into the hands of the Afghan people. There\nmust be no more Great Games with Afghan people as\nthe pawns, and no more regional rivalries, with Afghan\npeople as the victims.\nWe know that the one institution in the world\nwhich can deliver this better future is here now: the\nUnited Nations. We should all give Ambassador\nBrahimi every support in planning a future that leads to\nAfghanistan retaking its place as a fully fledged\nmember of the international community, able to protect\nand promote the interests of all of its people.\nThat nations have come so closely together to\nfight terrorism shows how the world is changing.\nHowever, we have to build a deeper and wider\nconsensus to tackle the other great issues which we\nface. It is not just the Afghan people who have been\nexcluded from the values on which the United Nations\nwas founded.\nConflict, poverty, discrimination and injustice\nstill blight the lives of millions in every part of the\nglobe. Individuals\u2019 rights, especially women\u2019s rights,\nare ignored with impunity, and then the very structure\nof communities collapses. Where this happens, where\nsocieties disintegrate or States fail, we put at risk the\nbasis of global society itself.\nIf 11 September teaches us anything, it is surely\nthis: that if we ignore our moral responsibilities to each\nother, we will be forced later to face painful\nconsequences.\nNowhere is the need for action now more obvious\nthan in Africa. Yes, there has been some progress there.\nInternational work on the ground to resolve conflict has\nbrought hope to Sierra Leone and to the Great Lakes\nregion. Responsible Governments working across the\ncontinent in partnership with effective international\ndonors have succeeded in reducing poverty. But we\nshould not delude ourselves about the scale of the task\nthat remains in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa average\nincome today is much lower than it was 30 years ago.\nThe New Partnership for African Development\ntherefore requires the support of the whole community\nof nations. Africa deserves the same opportunities that\nwe in the West take for granted. We in the West must\nacknowledge that while removing barriers to global\ntrade and to finance, we have not always dismantled\nbarriers to dignity and equality. In theory, global free\ntrade should have created the conditions for every\neconomy to exploit its comparative advantage in the\nworld marketplace. In practice, protectionist barriers\nstill survive, especially against trade in agriculture,\ndamaging Africa\u2019s interests today, and all our interests\ntomorrow.\nAs we meet here in New York, our colleagues at\nthe World Trade Organization meeting in Doha have\nthe opportunity to begin to put these injustices right.\nLaunching a new trade round would be the clearest\npossible signal of the world\u2019s determination to spread\nthe benefits of wealth and of prosperity more fairly.\n22\n\nOur predecessors gave us the United Nations. In\nthe succeeding years, it developed expertise in\npeacekeeping, in conflict prevention, in human rights\nand in reconstruction, to consolidate the gains of 1945.\nMy message today is that our generation faces as\ndaunting a task, but a different one. That task is to\ndefeat international terrorism. But to do that we have to\ncombine the agenda of 10 September with the agenda\nof 11 September, as the Secretary-General emphasized\nin his powerful speech yesterday. And we must take not\nonly military action, but also diplomatic action to\nreduce tensions that terrorists exploit.\nNowhere are those tensions greater than in the\nMiddle East. The path to a settlement there is plain. It\nhas to be based on a political process that implements\nUnited Nations resolutions. It must deliver security for\nIsrael within recognized borders while at the same time\ncreating a viable Palestinian State. We should give the\nparties every help to reach a settlement. But our efforts\nwill be wasted unless the parties themselves show the\npolitical will to bring violence to a halt, and the\npolitical courage to make a deal.\nWe have seen, in the most graphic and brutal way\npossible, that chaos in one part of the world can\nundermine security in all parts of the world. Against\nthat chaos we must set our vision of peaceful\ncooperation among stable nations. Achieving that\nvision has now taken on a new urgency. Indeed, we are\nat a moment of strategic opportunity, which comes no\nmore than once to any generation. We owe it to those\nwho founded the international community to seize this\nmoment. Most of all, we owe it to those who will come\nafter us.\nToday we remember with sorrow the sacrifices\nthat earlier generations made. We remember with pride\nthe brave decisions that they took to build a better\nworld for us, and we salute the reconciliation and\nrecovery that followed. My hope is that our children\nand our grandchildren will look back on this period\nwith no less pride, and that future generations will be\nable to say that we here faced up to a great evil; we did\nnot duck the decisions we had to take; we established\npeace in Afghanistan, constructive coexistence in the\nMiddle East and sustained development in Africa. We\nmade the necessary endeavour in the finest tradition of\nthe United Nations.\nThe United Nations stands for everything the\nterrorist seeks to destroy. My hope is that our\nsuccessors will look back on this era and say that we\nsaved succeeding generations from the scourge of\nterrorism as well as from the scourge of war.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me, on behalf of the Government of Guinea-\nBissau and its delegation, to express sincere\ncondolences to the people and Government of the\nUnited States and to the people and Government of the\nDominican Republic for the tragic event of 12\nNovember in New York , resulting in great loss of life.\nAllow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on\nyour election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly, which will certainly\nbe crowned with success thanks to your experienced\ndiplomatic skills and deep understanding of this\nuniversal Organization.\nThe delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which I have\nthe honour of heading, would like to assure you at this\ntime of its full cooperation in carrying out your noble\nmandate. I also extend my warm congratulations to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, on the\nconstructive way in which he led the work of the last\nsession.\nIn addition, I would like to reaffirm my\nGovernment\u2019s confidence in and regard for the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his clear\nleadership of the United Nations and his incessant\nsearch for peaceful and realistic solutions to the\nvarious conflicts and problems that affect humanity.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in October to\nour Secretary-General and to the United Nations, which\nhe so ably leads, proves not only his commitment to the\nattainment of peace and security, but also his important\nrole of working in the interests of humanity. For this\nreason, I extend to him my most sincere\ncongratulations and wishes for success in the second\nterm of office to which he was elected, and encourage\nhim to continue his efforts to reform and adapt the\nOrganization to the needs of our time, in the service of\npeace, progress and international cooperation.\nIn this vein, I urge the widening and deepening of\nthe reforms already undertaken and appeal once again\nfor a reform of the Security Council to increase the\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent\nmembers and to bring the right of veto into line with\nthe needs of today.\nThis first General Assembly session of the\ntwenty-first century represents, as was stated in the\nMillennium Declaration, a historic challenge for the\nbuilding of new international relations. At the\nMillennium Summit, our dignitaries worked hard to\nenvision the role that the Organization must play in the\ntwenty-first century. They solemnly reaffirmed their\ncommitment to the noble ideals of the United Nations,\nas well as their conviction that the role of the United\nNations is indispensable in the service of peace,\nprogress and international cooperation, and in support\nof the primacy of law. During that event, our heads of\nState and Government also discussed new perspectives\nfrom which to confront the great challenges of\nglobalization for the promotion of a new international\nhuman order.\nIn this context, the year 2001 was marked by\nimportant international conferences: the recent World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which took place\nin Durban, and whose final Declaration not only\ndefines slavery as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d but also\nlaunches an appeal for appropriate and efficient\nmeasures to reverse the consequences of slavery. It also\nrecognizes that those \u201chistorical injustices\u201d contribute\nto poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social\nexclusion, economic disparities and the insecurity of\nmany peoples, especially in developing countries.\n9\n\nDespite those prospects for a new historical\nperspective, this session takes place at a moment of\ndeep disquiet for our countries and peoples. In fact, the\nwave of attacks perpetrated on 11 September this year\nagainst the Pentagon in Washington and the World\nTrade Center in New York, just a few kilometres from\nthe Assembly, is reason for great concern for my\nGovernment and the President of the Republic,\nMr. Kumba Yal\u00e1, who promptly and strongly\ncondemned the cowardly terrorist acts perpetrated\nagainst the United States of America. Today I reaffirm\nbefore the Assembly our unreserved condemnation of\nterrorism in all its forms, wherever or whenever it\noccurs and whatever its origins, since it constitutes a\nthreat to security, peaceful relations between States,\ndemocratic institutions and the fulfilment of human\nrights.\nToday more than ever before, it is necessary to\nadopt a broad strategy for the entire international\ncommunity to combat terrorism. In that context,\nGuinea-Bissau appeals for greater international\ncooperation on the issue of terrorism, specifically,\nthrough the ratification of already existing regional and\ninternational instruments and the approval, within the\ncontext of the United Nations, of a comprehensive\nconvention that covers all aspects of terrorism, from a\nuniversally accepted definition to its suppression.\nIt is in precisely this regard that my country,\nGuinea-Bissau, became a party to the Organization of\nAfrican Unity Convention on the Prevention and\nCombating of Terrorism, adopted in 1999 at Algiers,\nand to the Dakar Declaration on this same scourge,\nissued last October. We are determined to accelerate\nthe ratification and implementation processes of all the\nagreements that seek to fight terrorism.\nThe beginning of the twenty-first century, which\ncoincides with the threshold of the new millennium, is\nmarked by areas of tension and armed conflict that\nthreaten peace and security and fuel the proliferation of\nand illicit traffic in small arms. In this context, the\nsubregional and regional organizations, with the\nsupport of the international community, through the\nUnited Nations, are fully engaged in the search for\npolitical solutions to conflicts. From Sierra Leone to\nAngola, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\nBurundi, from Somalia to Kosovo, from East Timor to\nthe Middle East, the ghosts of conflict still hover as we\nseek to find solutions to existing conflicts.\nAt present in Sierra Leone, a country of our\nsubregion, the Lom\u00e9 Agreement, concluded under the\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), and the subsequent success of the\nUnited Nations-supported programme for disarming the\nparties involved in the conflict, allow us to hope for a\nlegitimate peace.\nIn Angola, a member of the Community of\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, cruel and destabilizing\nacts continue to take place, causing enormous pain to\nour Angolan brothers, who have endured the nightmare\nof four decades of war. I would like to express our\nsolidarity with the Angolan people and Government,\nand appeal for dialogue as part of the solution to that\nconflict.\nIn East Timor, with the elections for the\nConstituent Assembly already held, an important step\nwas taken in the transition to the independence that\nwill be proclaimed in May next year, and towards its\nacceptance as a fully fledged member of global society.\nWe hope that the international community will\ncontinue to offer its valuable assistance to our Maubere\nbrothers, who can finally aspire to rebuild their country\nin peace.\nIn the Middle East, the conflict between Israel\nand Palestine is at the crux of the situation. It is in that\ncontext that we appeal to the parties, in accordance\nwith the Mitchell plan, to implement the accords\nwithout delay and reaffirm the fundamental principles\nestablished at Madrid and Oslo, as well as the\nsubsequent agreements. This requires the parties to\nabstain from all actions that endanger the peace process\nand all activity that is contrary to international law.\nFinally, the embargoes imposed upon certain\ncountries, such as Cuba, continue to be a source of\nconcern because of their very negative repercussions\non the vulnerable populations of those countries, above\nall women and children. The populations involved\nappeal for dialogue with a view to a definitive solution\nto those issues.\nThe sombre scene characterized by areas of\nconflict and tension in the world, particularly in Africa,\nplaces on us a moral obligation to continue to act with\neven greater determination and courage to end those\nconflicts and the sources of those tensions. Along these\nlines, allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General,\nKofi Annan, on his last report on the causes of conflict\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\n10\n\ndevelopment in Africa, a document of great interest for\nthe African continent.\nThe global economic situation \u2014 particularly\nafter the events of 11 September \u2014 and its negative\nimpact, felt especially in the least developed countries,\nis also an issue of concern for my Government. The\nsolutions to the specific problems on the international\nagenda require not only concerted action, but also both\nbilateral and multilateral contacts, which Guinea-\nBissau has always supported. My Government believes\nin concerted and combined efforts with a view to\nfostering economic growth and full employment in a\nfairer global economy. Bearing in mind that a majority\nof African countries have agriculture as their economic\nbase, we appeal to our development partners, such as\nthe European Union, the United States and Japan,\namong others, to open their markets to the flow of\nagricultural products from our countries.\nBy virtue of its important mission to generate an\nauthentic North-South dialogue, the United Nations is\nour universal conscience, whose highest priority is to\nmeet the needs of developing countries. The\nprogrammes of action originating from the series of\nmajor conferences of the last decade and from other\nimportant meetings which took place this year are of\nspecial importance in that they contribute to identifying\nneeds, formulating objectives and defining strategies\nfor the realization of sustainable development rooted in\nsustainable economic growth, social justice and the\nprotection of the environment. We are now waiting for\nthose results to be translated into concrete benefits,\nthus opening the way for a better global economic\nsituation.\nAs all Members know, Guinea-Bissau continues\nto live with the effects of the absurd and disastrous\narmed conflict of 1998 and 1999, which, apart from the\nirreparable loss of human lives, caused deep trauma to\nour entire society and destroyed or damaged the\ncountry\u2019s existing basic infrastructure. In addition, the\nmarked decline in foreign aid and the slump in export\nprices of cashew nuts, our main export commodity,\nconstitute the basic reason for our lack of resources and\nfor the increase in poverty. This runs counter to the\ninterests of our citizens and makes them more\nvulnerable.\nHowever, an unshakeable will to rebuild the\ncountry has led my Government, together with some\ndevelopment partners, to redouble its efforts to define a\nstrategy for sustainable development and to take\nmeasures in the realm of human rights and\nreconciliation. The programme for the reconstruction\nand rehabilitation of infrastructure and for national\nreconciliation, the multi-year convergence programmes\nfor stability, growth and solidarity elaborated in the\nframework of the West African Economic and\nMonetary Union, the programmes of demobilization,\nreintegration and social reinsertion of combatants, the\nfight against poverty, the fight against AIDS and other\nprogrammes are clear examples of the will and\ncommitment of the Government to create a new reality\nfor society and a new action programme intended to\neffect change in that society. The President of the\nRepublic, Mr. Kumba Yal\u00e1, is the main mentor and\nguarantor of those programmes by virtue of the sacred\nresponsibility given to him, the highest ranking\nofficial, by the voters of Guinea-Bissau.\nThe programme of action requires not only\ninternal but also external efforts. That is why the\nGovernment is strengthening its cooperation with other\ncountries at the subregional, regional and international\nlevels. Despite all its efforts, Guinea-Bissau continues\nto need the valuable assistance of its development\npartners and of the international community to face the\ndifficult economic and social challenges that lie ahead.\nIn that regard, we appeal to the international\ncommunity to bolster its support for Guinea-Bissau and\nto make donors aware of the importance of\nparticipating actively in next year\u2019s round table on\nassistance to my country.\nThe celebration this year of the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations and of the\nInternational Year of Mobilization against Racism,\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\nIntolerance, which coincides with the fifty-third\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, is a cause for satisfaction for my Government.\nThis is reflected in the creation of a inter-ministerial\ncommittee on human rights tasked with overseeing\nrespect for human rights in our country and promoting\neducation and awareness programmes on human rights\nissues.\nSince his landslide election to the presidency of\nthe nation, the President of the Republic, Mr. Kumba\nYal\u00e1, has increased his contacts at various levels, with\nfriendship visits to Guinea, the Gambia, Senegal,\nNigeria, Morocco, Sierra Leone and other countries\nwith the aim of strengthening cooperation and\n11\n\ncontributing to peaceful solutions within the\nsubregional framework.\nIt is in that same spirit that the authorities of my\ncountry have maintained vigilance in the area of the\nborder with Senegal, with the objective of guaranteeing\nthe security and tranquillity of our populations in that\nnorthern zone.\nIn this first year of the new millennium and of the\ntwenty-first century, despite certain echoes of\noptimism, poverty and underdevelopment unfortunately\npersist and have been aggravated in many areas of the\nworld, particularly in the least developed countries,\namong which is Guinea-Bissau. The developing\ncountries, in particular the least developed among\nthem, continue to be marginalized in the world\neconomy and to be victims of extreme poverty, due\nmainly to decreased official development assistance, to\nthe lack of productive human resources, to the\nweakness of domestic and foreign investments, to the\nslump in commodity prices, to the problems of debt, to\nHIV/AIDS and also, obviously, to armed conflicts.\nTo overcome this situation it is imperative to\nensure the integration of developing countries into the\nworld economy and to oppose the marginalization of\nthose countries, ensuring sustainable, accelerated and\ndurable economic development as well as the\nelimination of poverty, inequality and misery. In that\ncontext, we are pleased at the results of the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, which took place in May this year at\nBrussels. We are certain that the results of the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to take place at Monterrey, Mexico, in\nMarch 2002, will be translated into concrete action that\ncan reverse those negative trends.\nCooperation frameworks include the Lom\u00e9\nConvention of the European Union and the African,\nCaribbean and Pacific countries; the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development; the\nUnited States African Growth and Opportunity Act;\nand the Genoa decision of the Group of 8 on the\ncreation of a fund for the fight against contagious\ndiseases and AIDS on the African continent. We look\nforward to the latter group\u2019s next summit on African\nproblems.\nBecause of the particularly difficult economic\nsituation it faces, Africa continues to look for realistic\nsolutions for the continent and is giving clear proof of\nits determination to improve the economies of the\ncountries of the continent. Beyond the programmes of\nstructural adjustment and other development\nprogrammes that have been adopted for the continent,\nthe New African Initiative, resulting from the merger\nof the plans presented by the heads of State of Senegal\nand of South Africa, has come at an opportune time. It\nis an African plan for Africans that provides developed\ncountries a historic opportunity to forge a genuine\npartnership based on mutually beneficial self-interest.\nThe Initiative, adopted unanimously at the most recent\nsummit of the Organization of African Unity, held at\nLusaka, should be implemented with the utmost speed.\nWe appeal to the entire international community, and to\nour development partners in particular, to support the\nInitiative, which encompasses the relaunching of our\neconomies, debt reduction and the fight against AIDS.\nIt is regrettable that the response of our\ndevelopment partners has not always been\ncommensurate with the degree of sacrifice that has\nbeen endured or with the dimensions of the problems\nthat have been identified. That is a paradox. It is also a\nparadox that the decisions of major international\nconferences should not be reflected in practical,\nconcrete measures to implement those decisions.\nThe new collective challenge is to bring to light\nthe image of a world of equality, dignity, equity and\ninternational solidarity, all translated into economic\nand social cooperation and genuine social adjustment\nwith the human being as its central point of reference.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, first of all, please allow me to warmly\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. I am confident that under your able\nguidance and with the close cooperation of all\ndelegates, this session will be crowned with success. I\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express my\nsincere thanks to Mr. Holkeri for what he did as\nPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.\nA year ago, the United Nations convened the\nhistoric Millennium Summit. The United Nations\nMillennium Declaration issued by the Summit\nidentifies the objectives for promoting world peace and\ndevelopment in the new century.\nInternational developments over the past year\ndemonstrate that more and more countries have opted\nfor increasing dialogue and cooperation, preserving\nworld peace and seeking common development. To be\nsure, the cause of human progress still involves a long\nand arduous effort. Factors of uncertainty in the\ninternational situation are on the rise. More efforts\nshould be made to democratize international relations,\nand there has been no marked change in the irrational\ninternational economic order.\nTerrorism is a widespread scourge that threatens\nworld peace and stability. We strongly condemn the\nterrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September,\nand extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to\nthe families of the innocent victims, as well as to the\nGovernment and the people of the United States. China\nhas always opposed all forms of terrorism. No matter\nwhen, where or in what form terrorism strikes, and no\nmatter whom it is directed against, it should be met\nwith condemnation and responded to with counter-\nstrikes by the international community, which should\nadopt a unified position on the matter.\nChina has taken an active part in international\ncooperation against terrorism. In addition to joining\nmost of the international conventions against terrorism,\nChina has ratified the Shanghai Convention on\nCombating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism,\nconcluded by the member States of the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization.\nChina is in favour of a primary role for the United\nNations and the Security Council in the international\neffort against terrorism. China supports the relevant\nresolutions that have been adopted and is in favour of\ncloser cooperation and coordination among the various\ncountries concerned to this end.\nChina strongly believes that any military action\nagainst terrorism should have a clearly defined target\nand avoid harming innocent people. All such actions\nshould be consistent with the purposes and principles\nof the Charter of the United Nations and other\nuniversally recognized norms of international law, and\nshould serve the long-term interests of peace in the\nregion and the world at large.\nChina believes that terrorism is a tiny fringe of\nextreme evil, representing neither one particular ethnic\ngroup nor one particular religion. They must not,\ntherefore, be lumped together. China, too, is threatened\nby terrorism. The \u201cEastern Turkestan\u201d terrorist forces\nare trained, equipped and financed by international\nterrorist organizations. The fight against the \u201cEastern\nTurkestan\u201d group is an important aspect of the\ninternational fight against terrorism.\n19\n\nIn today\u2019s world, the question of security is\nbecoming increasingly multifaceted and globalized.\nOnly enhanced international cooperation can help us\neffectively cope with global security challenges and\nbring about universal and lasting security. Countries\nshould endeavour to foster a new security concept,\nbased on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and\ncollaboration. They should seek security through\nmutual trust and pursue cooperation to their mutual\nbenefit so as to effectively reduce factors of insecurity.\nThe issue of arms control has always been closely\ninterrelated with that of security. In the face of the new\nsituation, we should go on working for the preservation\nof the existing legal regime for international arms\ncontrol and disarmament and for the maintenance of\nglobal strategic stability, without jeopardizing the\nsecurity of any country.\nTackling regional hot spots is vital to regional\nand global security. We are following with deep\nconcern the current developments in the Middle East.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict that broke out in\nSeptember last year is continuing unabated. It poses a\ngrave threat to the Middle East peace process and to\nregional stability. China supports the relevant United\nNations resolutions and the principle of land for peace.\nIt also supports the Palestinian people in their just\nstruggle to regain their legitimate national rights and\ninterests. We hope that the Israeli and Palestinian sides\nwill take constructive measures and closely coordinate\nwith the international community in its mediating\nefforts so as to create conditions for easing the tension\nand reactivating the peace process. China supports a\ngreater role for the Security Council in this respect.\nWe are concerned about the situation in South\nAsia. Given the current complex situation, we hope\nthat the countries in the region will strengthen mutual\nunderstanding and mutual trust and coexist in peace\nand amity. As a neighbour of Afghanistan, we have\nbeen following the changing Afghan situation closely.\nWe believe that, in order to find a solution to the\nAfghan issue, the following principles should be\nobserved. First, the sovereignty, independence and\nterritorial integrity of Afghanistan should be ensured.\nSecondly, the Afghan people should be allowed to\ndecide on a solution independently. Thirdly, the future\ngovernment in Afghanistan should be broad-based and\nembody the interests of all ethnic groups in the\ncountry; Afghanistan should live in amity with all\ncountries, particularly its neighbours. Fourthly, the\nsolution should serve peace and stability in the region.\nFifthly, the United Nations should play a more active\nrole.\nSince the beginning of this year, the world\neconomy has clearly slowed down, and the situation\nhas been further aggravated by the incidents of 11\nSeptember. Developing countries are finding\nthemselves in increasingly dire straits. The\ninternational community must act with a greater sense\nof urgency and accord higher priority to development.\nDeveloped countries should act more vigorously\nto promote development. They should adopt effective\nmeasures and make greater efforts to revitalize the\nglobal economy. We hope that the developed countries\nwill demonstrate a broader vision and a cooperative\nspirit in providing assistance to developing countries.\nIn recent years, anti-globalization activities in\nmany parts of the world have increased. In fact,\nglobalization is neither a panacea for development nor\na monster causing disaster. The appropriate response to\nglobalization should maximize its advantages and\nminimize its disadvantages so that all countries can\ncome out winners and prosper side by side.\nGlobalization should benefit all people from all social\nstrata in all countries.\nThe United Nations has an irreplaceable role to\nplay in international cooperation in response to\nglobalization. It should increase its input in\ndevelopment and work more effectively to fulfil the\ndevelopment objectives set forth in the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration.\nChina is supportive of the World Trade\nOrganization\u2019s plans to launch a new round of\nmultilateral trade talks. It is our hope that the new\nround will give full consideration to the concerns and\ninterests of the developing countries.\nThe Ninth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting was held\nsuccessfully in October in Shanghai, China. The\nmeeting was convened at a critical moment, soon after\nthe incidents of 11 September, when prospects for the\nglobal economy seemed grim. Focusing on the theme\n\u201cMeeting new challenges in the new century:\npromoting common prosperity through participation\nand cooperation\u201d, the leaders conducted an in-depth\nexchange of views and reached broad consensus.\nHaving boosted intra-APEC cooperation among the\n20\n\nmembers and reinforced their resolve to restore\neconomic growth, the meeting sent out a clear, positive\nsignal to markets throughout the world and took a\nresolute step forward in advancing cooperation in the\nAsia-Pacific region. The meeting will have a positive\nand far-reaching impact on Asia-Pacific economic\ncooperation.\nPresident Jiang Zemin made clear to the world\nChina\u2019s future objectives, guiding principles and\ndomestic and foreign policies in the important speech\nthat he delivered on 1 July this year. The principal task\nfor the Chinese people in the new century is to press\nahead with the modernization programme, work\ntowards the grand cause of national reunification,\nsafeguard world peace and promote common\ndevelopment.\nIndeed, the purpose of China\u2019s foreign policy is\nto safeguard world peace and promote common\ndevelopment. China needs an environment of\nfriendship and good-neighbourliness and external\nconditions of stability and prosperity. To achieve, and\nsafeguard, such an international environment serves\nChina\u2019s national interests. It is also China\u2019s duty as a\nmember of the international community.\nWe believe that all civilizations and social\nsystems in the world can, and should, exist side by side\non a long-term basis, complementing one another and\nmaking progress together, in a spirit of seeking\ncommon ground while putting aside differences.\nWe stand ready to engage in mutually beneficial\ncooperation with all countries in the world on an equal\nfooting towards world peace and development, with the\naim of achieving common development. Our entry into\nthe World Trade Organization will usher in a\ncompletely new phase of our opening-up process.\nThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the\nrestoration of China\u2019s lawful seat in the United\nNations. Tremendous changes have since taken place in\nthe world, in China and in the United Nations. China\u2019s\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations,\nhowever, remains unchanged. In the new century,\nChina will, as always, vigorously support the work of\nthe United Nations and continue to work together with\nother Member States for a better world.\n\n\n\n\n"

We congratulate the\nSecretary-General on this well-deserved recognition of\nhis work, which has promoted among Member States\nthe benefits of international association and solidarity.\nThis session of the Assembly began in an\natmosphere of profound distress for all members of the\ninternational community. The tragically terrible\nterrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September\nare shocking to the human conscience. Those whose\nperverse and irrational actions took the lives of\nthousands of innocent people \u2014 including many\nEcuadorians \u2014 committed a grave attack on\ninternational peace and security.\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to affirm to the people\nand the Government of the United States of America\nthe profound condolences and solidarity of the people\nand the Government of Ecuador following this\nimmense tragedy and to reiterate our strongest\ncondemnation of those criminal acts, which have done\nviolence to all peoples, as well as to universal\nprinciples and values.\nThat is why Ecuador \u2014 a peace-loving country\nconvinced of the predominant role of the United\nNations as the key institution for decisions affecting\nthe world \u2014 praises the action of the General\nAssembly and the Security Council in response to\nterrorism, particularly the Council\u2019s adoption of\nresolution 1373 (2001), which contains the guidelines\nfor all Member States to work urgently and in concert\nto prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Likewise, the\ninternational community must conclude negotiations on\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\nto strengthen the relevant judicial framework with\nconcrete measures to prevent, sanction and combat this\nscourge. Ecuador is committed at the national, regional\nand international levels to the fight against terrorism in\nall its forms and manifestations.\nIn the final years of the twentieth century, great\nchanges took place in the world, which led to new\ninternational trends, especially in terms of the process\nof globalization and threats to international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe developing countries, such as my own, began\nadapting their national structures to deal with the\ndemands of a decidedly competitive environment.\nHowever, it must be said that it is obvious that the\nadjustments and changes those countries have made to\ntheir policies and strategies are not enough in\nthemselves to achieve complete results as long as the\nstructural causes of the disparity between the level of\ndevelopment of highly industrialized economies and\nthat of economies in need of capital and advanced\ntechnology persist. That disparity continues to widen\nbecause of financial difficulties caused by unstable\nshort-term capital flows, persistent external debt and\nobstacles to truly international trade.\nThere are signs that current international\neconomic trends are far from providing the equilibrium\nand justice needed to overcome the unfavourable\nburdens inherited from the twentieth century. Poverty\nhas grown at alarming rates in all regions. International\norganized crime has exacerbated violence and\ninsecurity in society. Massive international migration\ntowards developed regions continues to increase. These\nphenomena, along with many others, result from the\nlack of real, universal agreements to assist the\ndevelopment of human beings.\n21\n\nThe problems that the world faces today respect\nno national borders. They are threats demanding not\nunilateral action but responses based on solidarity and\nconcerted action. That interdependence is what enabled\nthe heads of Government and State, at the Millennium\nAssembly, to agree on making the United Nations, the\nsupreme multilateral forum, a suitable and effective\ninstrument to fight for the development of all peoples\nof the world; to fight against poverty, ignorance and\ndisease; to fight against injustice, violence, terror and\ncrime; and to fight against the deterioration and\ndestruction of the planet. They also committed\nthemselves to freeing all people from the scourge of\nwar, to eradicating the dangers posed by weapons of\nmass destruction and to strengthening respect for the\nrule of law in national and international affairs.\nEcuador, as a country that believes in and\npractices the peaceful settlement of international\ndisputes, regrets and condemns conflicts between\nStates, as well as those within States caused by civil\nwar, ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Government\nof Ecuador is concerned by the uncontrolled violence\noccurring between the peoples of Palestine and Israel,\nwhich continues to reap a tragic harvest of death and\ndestruction. We recognize the right of the Palestinian\npeople to a free and independent State, as well as the\nState of Israel\u2019s right to exist within secure and\ninternationally recognized borders. Ecuador reiterates\nits appeal to both parties to quickly return to peace\nnegotiations.\nLast August, Ecuador assumed the presidency of\nthe Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Its\nleadership is guided by its profound commitment to the\ncause of general and complete disarmament under\neffective international control, which would make it\npossible to foster peace and confidence among nations.\nWe are witnessing the intensification of a\nphenomenon as old as humanity itself, undoubtedly\nlinked to the historical development of civilization. I\nam referring to the enormous challenge posed by the\nincrease in human migration, especially from the\ncountries of the South towards the North.\nWhile migration has been positive in that it has\ncontributed to fruitful exchange between various\npeoples and has deepened dialogue processes and\nmutual enrichment between diverse cultures, in most\ncases the reason for it stems from the individual\u2019s\ndesire to seek better living conditions and broader\neconomic prospects. We cannot think of human history\nwithout the constant and ever present phenomenon of\nmigration, and the current era is no exception. In the\npresent age of the globalization of markets and the\npossibility of a new round of multilateral trade\nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nthe liberalization of the administration of services\nthrough the free movement of persons must be\nemphasized.\nToday many developing countries of the world,\nafflicted by the serious consequences of economic\ncrisis and the prevalence of structural failures that are\ndifficult to overcome, have become net producers of\nmigrants, men and women who feel compelled to seek\nbroader horizons legally. Ecuador is one of those\ncountries because of the most serious economic crisis\nof its recorded history, exacerbated by external factors\nthat changed the momentum of the national\ndevelopment process. Internal and external factors\nmerged in recent years, deepening this crisis, which we\nare overcoming in a positive way at enormous\nsacrifice.\nWhile migration tends to be a positive\nphenomenon in terms of historic objectives, the\nconsequences for individuals are painful and stir our\nconscience. Because of that, my country has taken a\nseries of actions to protect the rights of migrants and\ntheir families. With the support of the International\nOrganization for Migration, we have held several\nmeetings in which the State and civil society have\nparticipated. They have enabled us, on the one hand, to\nhave direct testimony about the serious problems of\nthis group of individuals who have left their countries\nvoluntarily to find better opportunities and, on the\nother hand, to obtain concrete commitments aimed at\nprotecting and defending human rights. I wish to\nunderline the transnational nature of the migration\nproblem, which requires active cooperation between\ncountries of origin and countries receiving immigrants,\nas well as international bodies. In this context, I am\nhappy to point out that Ecuador and Spain signed an\nagreement aimed at regulating migration, which\nundoubtedly has been beneficial for migrant citizens\nand signatory countries.\nEcuador appeals to all Governments and sectors\nof civil society, but particularly to those of the\ndeveloped world \u2014 receivers of migrant workers - to\nredouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights of\nthis vulnerable sector of society in a non-\n22\n\ndiscriminatory way, conscious of all the positive and\nfruitful aspects that the migration phenomenon brings\nto the general development of countries, as\ndemonstrated by European history of recent centuries\nand the integration of the Americas into the West.\nIf the twentieth century was the stage for some of\nthe greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history,\nit is true that in that period we also witnessed the birth\nof a new global awareness of the urgency to protect and\npromote human rights and to preserve man\u2019s home,\nland and environment.\nMy country has fully assumed this global\nchallenge. We are signatories to the main instruments\non this important item at both the international and the\nhemispheric level, and we have national tools that\nenable us to achieve such objectives. The National Plan\non Human Rights, adopted as a State policy in June\n1998 by civil society and the State, is perhaps the most\ninnovative and visionary instrument that has been\ndeveloped in our country. We hope that it will enable\nus to promote a real culture of tolerance and respect\nbetween the ethnic, social and cultural groups of our\nsociety. With this plan, Ecuador also complied with the\nmandate of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and\nProgramme of Action.\nIn keeping with all the above-mentioned points,\nEcuador places importance on one of the mandates of\nthe Carabobo Act, signed in July 2001 by the\nPresidents of the Andean Community of Nations, and\nhas begun work on a draft Andean Charter of Human\nRights, aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect for\nand the promotion of the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms of the individual in the specific areas of\nculture and ethnic plurality characteristic of the\nAndean subregion. Ecuador was a pioneer in this\nimportant matter when, in 1980, within the subregional\nframework, it spurred on the adoption of the Riobamba\nCharter, which includes among its postulates the\nprotection of human rights as an international\nobligation of all States and the condition that legitimate\njoint action carried out in protecting such rights must\nnot violate the principle of non-intervention. Within\nthis same context, Ecuador signed the Rome Statute of\nthe International Court of Justice of July 1998, and it is\ntaking measures for its prompt ratification.\nTurning to the WTO and the Free Trade Area of\nthe Americas (FTAA), there is no doubt that one of the\nmost important items on the foreign policy agenda of\nStates is international economic relations. Ecuador\nwishes to express some views on this, at the moment\nwhen the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is taking\nplace in Qatar.\nEcuador deems it fundamental to pursue the\nprocess of opening up trade, reducing tariffs and\neliminating unnecessary trade barriers. However, my\ncountry also shares the doubts of some developing\ncountries about the advantages of launching a new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations when the\ncommitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet been\nfully implemented, particularly those relating to the\nreduction and the elimination of agricultural subsidies\nand to agreement on special and differential treatment\nprovisions in favour of developing countries. These are\npriority items of interest for Ecuador, as is the\nexpansion of openness in agricultural trade.\nWe emphasize the necessary reform required by\nthe WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding to\nstrengthen the implementation regime of the decisions\nof the relevant ad hoc groups and the appeals body. For\nexample, Ecuador was never able to obtain the\ncompensation to which it was entitled, in spite of\nhaving won the banana dispute in all the proceedings\nbefore the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and an\narbitration award of $201.4 million annually, the\namount of the damages caused to my country by an\nillegal import, sales and distribution scheme of that\nproduct in Europe.\nGiven our own experience in this dispute, we\nbelieve that compensation must be binding, if we are\nreally speaking about free markets in the full sense of\nthe word, and that retaliatory measures in the same\nsector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair the\ndamages caused, particularly to the economies of\ndeveloping countries. It would also be worth evaluating\nother types of compensation, such as increasing\ntechnical cooperation, as a European country is\nproposing at this time with respect to Ecuador.\nProgress in trade negotiations and the fulfilment\nof commitments already made will make it possible for\nus to have an international economic and financial\nclimate conducive to investment and to growth of the\nworld economy, which will make a positive\ncontribution to social and human development. These\nsame proposals give us hope in the negotiations of the\nFTAA \u2014 the Trade Negotiations Committee of which\nEcuador is currently president. Our efforts take into\n23\n\naccount the various positions of countries, as well as\ntheir different levels of development and sizes of their\neconomies, since we must seek consensus on decisions\nin a way that makes all the parties involved feel that\ntheir interests are guaranteed. For least developed\ncountries, the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free-\ntrade zone poses a challenge and at the same time\noffers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integrated\ninto world economy in this new phase.\nI turn next to the question of external debt and\ndevelopment financing. The enormous limitations\nfaced by heavily indebted developing countries such as\nEcuador, resulting from disproportionately large\nexternal-debt servicing costs and from persistent\nobstacles to marketing our exports, work against\nnational efforts to engender economic stability and\nsustainable development. Ecuador\u2019s total external debt\nnow stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domestic\nproduct and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget;\nthis has a negative impact on the financing of social\ndevelopment projects.\nExternal debt is mortgaging the economic present\nand future of developing countries; it has extremely\nadverse effects because it devours vast resources that\nwould otherwise be used in the fight against poverty, in\npromoting public health and education, and in meeting\nmany other urgent social needs. The situation thus has\nan increasing negative effect on market-oriented\nnational policies and the political and democratic\nstability of many countries. It is therefore time for the\ninternational community to adopt effective, fair,\nlasting, development-oriented measures so as to make\nprogress in easing this serious problem \u2014 a problem\nthat highly indebted medium-income countries too are\nfacing.\nEcuador attaches the greatest importance to the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment to be held next March at Monterrey. It\nwill be a good opportunity to define, from the\nfinancing perspective, a new kind of world cooperation\nthat will effectively support development, especially\nthe development of the countries of the South.\nI am pleased to announce the conclusion and\nsignature of an agreement between the World\nMeteorological Organization and the Government of\nEcuador on the establishment at Guayaquil of an\ninternational centre for research on El Ni\u00f1o. I urgently\nappeal to the United Nations and its specialized\nagencies, to the international community and to\ninternational and regional financial institutions for\nresolute cooperation to ensure that the centre begins its\nwork promptly.\nFinally, as an Ecuadorian, I wish to address the\nquestion of the Colombian conflict. I wish to say that\nmy country is following closely the internal political\nconflict in Colombia and the unfolding of a peace\nprocess in that country. In conformity with our policy\nof promoting dialogue and negotiation as the best way\nto overcome problems, we have frequently stated our\nunreserved political support for the Colombian\nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reach a negotiated peace with\narmed irregular groups operating in its country.\nEcuador applauds the peace initiatives of President\nAndr\u00e9s Pastrana and expresses the hope that they will\nbe meet with a matching response from those groups.\nPeace in Colombia is a top priority throughout the\nAmericas; it should also be a top priority for the\ninternational community. It is in the interest of all to\nhelp ensure that the Colombian conflict does not spread\nto the rest of the subregion.\nEcuador has committed itself to a broad and\nimaginative programme of development for our areas\nnear the Colombian border; these are aimed at\nsubstantial improvements in the living conditions of\nthe inhabitants, with a view to eliminating the severe\npoverty that gives rise to the violence of drug\ntrafficking. That programme has recently received\nmajor backing from the international community\nthrough the advisory group set up last month at\nBrussels. I appeal to our brethren and neighbours in\nColombia to join with us in similar programmes. I\nurgently appeal too to developed countries to continue\nto cooperate with such initiatives, which in the final\nanalysis are the best way to guarantee peace and\nsecurity.\nThe challenges facing mankind at the outset of\nthe twenty-first century must be tackled by all\ncountries, jointly and in solidarity. This is the\nbeginning of a new era for major international\ndecisions. The world Organization is the forum in\nwhich we can carry out a vast mission: equitably to\nsolve global problems and to buttress collective\nsecurity. Ecuador again commits itself to work\nceaselessly to attain those noble goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate you,\nSir, on your well-deserved election to preside over the\nwork of this General Assembly. We are familiar with\nyour valuable personal qualities and appreciate the\nleadership of your country, the Republic of Korea, in\nthe concert of nations. I would also like to express my\ngratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\nfor his excellent work.\nI should like to express the deepest condolences\nof the people and Government of Costa Rica to the\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic and to the\nrelatives and friends of the more than 200 Dominican\nnationals who lost their lives in the tragic aeroplane\naccident that occurred here yesterday.\nThis year, the General Assembly is meeting in\nextraordinary circumstances. Only two moths ago, this\ncity fell victim to the most dreadful and despicable\nterrorist attack in world history. Even today, just a few\nkilometres from this Hall, we can contemplate,\nbewildered, the column of smoke that marks the\nremains of the twin towers. The rubble reminds us of\nthe destruction, pain and death caused by violence and\nirrational hatred. Therefore, I cannot let pass this\nopportunity without reiterating the deepest condolences\nof the people and Government of Costa Rica to the\npeople and Government of the United States.\nOn 11 September, the terrorists targeted not only\nNew York, but the whole of humankind. Today, we all\nare victims of terrorism. Costa Rica realizes that\nterrorism is an extremely grave crime against humanity\nthat victimizes the innocent civil population and\nendangers the international community as a whole. For\nthis reason, we condemn terrorism categorically in all\nits forms and manifestations, wherever and by\nwhomever committed, while we proclaim that there is\nno political, philosophical, racial, ethnic or religious\njustification that legitimizes the commission of this\ncrime.\nThe recent terrorist attacks force us to rethink the\nconcept of international security and to renew our\ncommitment to mankind\u2019s basic values. When faced\nwith cruel fear and hatred, we must raise the flag of\ncivilization, tolerance and brotherhood. In the face of\nirrational violence, we must take up the arms of reason,\nlaw and order. Against terrorism, we must resort to the\nrule of law, justice and due process through\ninternational cooperation in the judicial and law\nenforcement fields.\nFaced with new treats to international security,\nthe community of nations must create effective and\nprecise mechanisms to ensure peace and development\nfor all peoples. In this context, we welcome the\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). It\nconstitutes a firm, proportionate and necessary answer\nto the despicable acts of 11 September.\nFurthermore, we welcome the progress achieved\nin the negotiation of a comprehensive convention to\nproscribe and punish terrorism in all its forms. My\ndelegation has taken active part in the recent\nnegotiations to solve the outstanding issues, and we are\ngrateful to the Secretary-General for his personal\ninvolvement in obtaining a consensus solution. We call\nupon all delegations to be flexible and to agree to the\nconsensus formula proposed by the coordinator of the\ncontact group on this issue.\nThe struggle against terrorism must lead us to\nbuild a true culture of peace and life. Right now, we\nhave the duty to plant the seeds of peace in order to\nsubstitute the vices of destruction and conflict with the\n30\n\nvirtues of fraternity, tolerance and cooperation among\nall men and women.\nCurrently, thanks to scientific and technological\nprogress, we can defeat disease, poverty, famine, hatred\nand war. We now posses the necessary economic,\ntechnological and philosophical means to guarantee to\neach and every person the highest standards of life and\nthe necessary conditions for their fullest physical,\nintellectual and spiritual development.\nIn this context, the United Nations could and\nshould play a central role in building a future of peace\nand freedom. This Organization must be a bastion\nagainst war, hatred and poverty. This institution must\nbe a beacon that lights the way and points towards the\nfinal goal.\nTo this end, the respect of human rights and\npromotion of human dignity, in all spheres, must be the\ncrux of the activities of the United Nations. The\nprotection of human beings is the only justification for\npeacekeeping activities. The promotion of human\ndignity is the only legitimate reason for pursuing\nsustainable development. The protection of human life\nis the only justification for the protection of the\nenvironment or search for economic development. The\nphilosophy of this Organization must therefore be\ndeeply humane.\nThe protection of human rights is the cornerstone\nof Costa Rica\u2019s foreign policy. Costa Ricans loathe\nevery violation of fundamental rights. We reject\nintolerance, hatred, inequality and war. We condemn\nextrajudicial executions, the death penalty, abortion,\nforced displacement, torture, rape and hostage-taking.\nWe categorically condemn all restrictions on freedom\nof speech and thought. The ethical values of the Costa\nRican identity make us proclaim a more just and\nhumane society and demand greater solidarity.\nThis Organization\u2019s work in the area of human\nrights is outstanding. The codification efforts and the\nperiodic conferences have provided the international\ncommunity with clear guidelines of conduct. Now, we\nmust concentrate our efforts in the implementation of\nthose norms at all levels of society, placing special\nemphasis on the fulfilment of economic, social and\ncultural rights.\nIn particular, it is necessary to rationalize and\ncoordinate the work of the monitoring organs,\nincluding the Commission on Human Rights, in order\nto make them more effective. Costa Rica considers it\nnecessary to review the national reports system in order\nto make it more transparent and expeditious. We\nbelieve that Member States must open their borders in\na candid and forthright manner to the human rights\nrapporteurs that are appointed by the Commission. This\nobligation flows directly from the commitments\nundertaken under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter.\nSimultaneously, we must respond positively to the\nrequest for additional resources made by the High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Moreover, the\nUnited Nations must remain vigilant so as to deal with\nthe new challenges that threaten the enjoyment of\nhuman rights.\nWe are concerned by the recent developments in\nthe area of cloning and biotechnology. For this reason,\nwe welcome the proposal by France and Germany to\nnegotiate an international agreement to prohibit the\nreproductive cloning of human beings. We believe that\nsuch an instrument should also forbid other forms of\nexperimentation in biotechnology that are contrary to\nboth human life and dignity.\nWe must strengthen the family as the basic\nbuilding block of society. The family is indispensable\nfor the formation of healthy, productive and\nresponsible citizens. We must also make additional\nefforts to support parents in the education of their\nchildren. In this regard, my country recently enacted a\nspecial law on responsible parenthood that ensures,\nthrough unprecedented and resolute judicial means,\nthat all biological fathers will be responsible for the\neducation and care of any offspring born out of\nwedlock.\nThe efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity must also be seen from the point of view of\nhuman rights. Armed conflicts produce continuous\nhumanitarian crises and atrocities. As long as war\nexists, it will be impossible to ensure respect for the\nbasic human rights. In situations of armed conflict, all\nnecessary measures must be taken to protect the\nsecurity of innocent civilians. It is crucial to provide\nthem with immediate assistance, in order to prevent\ngreater loss of life and destruction. It is also necessary\nto protect the human rights of refugees and displaced\npersons. Furthermore, at the end of an armed conflict,\ngreater international cooperation is required to rebuild\nthe national economy and lost infrastructure and to\nreturn life to normal.\n31\n\nFor several years, my delegation has advocated\nthe strengthening of the Security Council. We have said\nthat it is the only mechanism that humanity has to\nconfront the threats that beset it. Costa Rica has\nquestioned the Council when it has ignored its duties\nand has been reduced to irrelevance. We have criticized\nit when it has confined itself to giving weak and\ninadequate answers to the gravest political and\nhumanitarian emergencies. We have denounced it when\nit has been unable to act because of an irresponsible\nuse of the veto or the defence of national interests of\ncertain of its members. Today, the adoption of\nresolution 1373 (2001) gives us new hope. We are\nconfident that, in the future, the Security Council will\nconfront other emergency situations with the same\ndecisiveness, promptness and effectiveness.\nWeapons are a catalyst for armed conflicts. Their\nproliferation fans the flames of violence; exacerbates\nfighting and hatred; aggravates crime and terrorism;\nand fosters political and social instability. Military\narsenals prolong armed conflicts and impede peace\nprocesses, while the armies consume insatiably the\nmeagre national resources. To attain peace, it is\nnecessary to forbid the transfer of arms to rebel,\nextremist or terrorist groups. The transfer of weapons\nto Governments that commit systematic human rights\nviolations, do not respect democratic principles or have\nnot ratified the main instruments of international\nhumanitarian law should also be forbidden. We believe\nthat it is essential to regulate the possession of light\nweapons by civilians.\nMy country condemns the unilateral and\ndisproportionate use of force and countermeasures,\nwhile it supports the mechanisms and principles\nenshrined in international law. We must embrace\nnegotiation, dialogue, mediation and the judicial\nresolution of disputes. For this reason, Costa Rica fully\nendorses and has full confidence in the excellent work\nof the International Court of Justice. We believe that\nthe voluntary acceptance of its obligatory jurisdiction,\nthrough optional declarations, is clear proof of good\nfaith. However, we cannot fail to express our deep\nconcern about the existence and emergence of new\nreservations on the voluntary acceptance of the Court\u2019s\njurisdiction. Good faith in international relations\ndemands the withdrawal of those reservations.\nTrue and sustainable peace can be achieved only\nwhen decent living conditions are guaranteed to all\npeople; when there is a level of economic development\nsufficiently advanced so that everyone can satisfy his\nor her basic needs; when basic human rights are\nrespected; and when social and political differences are\nresolved through democratic means, dialogue and\nnegotiation. Therefore, it is essential to invest\nintensively and systematically in our human resources,\ndevoting all necessary resources to education and\nhealth. Only an educated population can live in\nfreedom, only a healthy population can work for\ndevelopment and only a cultured population can\nintegrate itself in the globalized contemporary world.\nSimilarly, it is necessary to ensure the sustainable\nuse and management of natural resources. Without a\nhealthy environment it is impossible to attain decent\nliving conditions, both for the present and for the\nfuture. We cannot ignore the damage caused to future\ngenerations by the destruction of thousands of square\nkilometres of the earth\u2019s forests.\nCosta Rica has developed a national system of\npayments for environmental services with a view to\nalleviating the impact of greenhouse gases and\npreserving our forests for mankind. My country has\ndevoted one quarter of its national territory to the\nprotection of its forests. The production of\nenvironmental goods and the provision of\nenvironmental services have become an engine of\nnational development. For these reasons, my country\nwill be honoured to be the host country of the first\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Forum on\nForests, which will be held in March 2002. We look\nforward to the active and constructive participation of\nall Member States in that meeting.\nMy delegation notes with concern the growing\ninequality in the area of vulnerability. The States with\nthe most fragile economies and whose inhabitants have\nfewer resources for prevention and reconstruction are\nthe ones that suffer most from the effects of natural\ndisasters. In our region, Central America, we have been\nthe victims of several disasters that, in the course of the\npast decade, have caused very serious human and\nmaterial losses. The lack of financial resources imposes\na harsh limit on the poorest nations\u2019 capacity to prevent\nhumanitarian emergencies. Therefore, we advocate an\nincrease in international cooperation with developing\nnations to enable them to design and implement\nprogrammes to reduce their vulnerability.\nIn this context, I would like to mention the\nbilateral assistance that the Republic of China in\n32\n\nTaiwan has given our region to face these emergencies.\nCosta Rica understands and supports the repeated\nefforts of the Republic of China in Taiwan, with 23\nmillion inhabitants and a firm process of democratic\ndevelopment and strengthening, to obtain\nrepresentation within this Organization. That country\nalso constitutes one of the main industrial centres of\nthe Asian basin, with which most Member States have\nstrong commercial and technical exchange ties. We\nhope that all differences will soon be put aside so that\nit will be possible to achieve agreements and both\nbranches of the Chinese people will be able to\nparticipate jointly in international forums.\nJust a couple of months ago we witnessed the\nbloody and abominable impact of international\nterrorism. Those despicable acts shook the conscience\nof humanity as a whole. In these circumstances, the\nworld awaits the guidance of the United Nations. Our\npeoples demand the decisive and firm action of the\ninternational community. Humanity as a whole calls on\nus to fulfil the lofty goals that we undertook when we\nestablished this Organization.\n\n\n"

I would also like to congratulate the members\nof the Bureau, as well as Mr. Harri Holkeri, President\nat the fifty-fifth session, for the outstanding efforts that\nhe made during his term of office.\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay a\nresounding tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, whose\nnoteworthy re-election to the post of Secretary-General\nof the United Nations confirms the exceptional\nqualities that he possesses as a diplomat and tireless\nchampion of peace and justice in the world. The Nobel\nPeace Prize, which has just been awarded to him, is\neloquent testimony to that.\nLast year, the leaders of the world met here to\ngive new impetus to our Organization and to commit\nthe international community to mobilizing itself more\nresolutely in the quest for international peace and\nsecurity and to fighting poverty, injustice and other\nscourges that threaten the very existence of humankind.\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September which\nstruck the United States and plunged the American\npeople, as well as other peoples throughout the world,\ninto grief truly marked a turning point in the\ndevelopment of international relations. They were a\nbrutal and atrocious reminder of both the complexity of\nproblems facing humankind and the urgent need to find\nappropriate solutions to them. Burkina Faso firmly and\nunambiguously condemned those barbaric, criminal\nand repugnant acts, and we condemn them still.\nFurthermore, we are resolved to take part in any\ninitiatives undertaken by the international community\nto eradicate terrorism and its causes. That is why\nBurkina Faso has begun the process of ratifying the\nOrganization of African Unity Convention on the\nPrevention and Combating of Terrorism, as well as\nUnited Nations conventions on this subject.\nMy Government has just adopted a draft law with\na view to ratifying the United Nations Convention\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime and the first,\nsecond and third protocols thereto, relating,\nrespectively, to the smuggling of migrants; trafficking\nin persons, particularly women and children; and the\nillicit manufacturing of and trafficking in weapons. In\ncooperation with the United Nations, Ouagadougou\nwill be hosting, from 28 to 30 November, a seminar for\nthe foreign ministers and ministers of justice of the\n2\n\ncountries of the Economic Community of West African\nStates, the aim of which is to accelerate the ratification\nof that Convention.\nIf it is to be effective, the campaign against\nterrorism must be part of a coherent and solid world\ncoalition, with its basis in the United Nations. At the\nsame time, it must take into consideration the realities\nand constraints confronting international relations. In\nother words, in addition to military action, the\ncampaign must include the most appropriate political\nand diplomatic measures in order effectively to deal\nwith conflicts and regional political problems and to\nreduce gross injustice and inequality which, because of\nthe frustration they generate, serve as a breeding\nground for extremists and fuel violence and hatred.\nAs our mobilization to fight terrorism must be\ntotal, so also must we see to the prior definition of\nclear objectives and appropriate methods for their\nimplementation. While it is true that terrorists are our\nenemies, it is also true that the manner in which we\ncombat them should not provide them with allies. As\nPresident Blaise Compaore recently stated:\n\u201cAs we see it, there is a risk that, if we are not\ncareful, the responses to the events of 11\nSeptember might lead to a catastrophic scenario\nfor humanity, with a tangled web of conflict:\nconflict between the Judeo-Christian world and\nthe Muslim world; conflict between West and\nEast; conflict between the rich North and the poor\nSouth. It is therefore crucial for our current\nleaders courageously to attack the injustices and\ninequalities which fuel violence and hatred.\u201d\nThe international community must therefore\nresolutely commit itself to combating poverty,\nepidemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, and economic and\ncommercial marginalization, as well as exclusion of all\nkinds, which continue to be the daily lot of many\nregions of the world.\nAttacking these injustices means necessarily that\nwe have to find a solution to the question of the Middle\nEast. The right of the Palestinians to establish an\nindependent State, respectful of the existence and\nsecurity of Israel, is a sine qua non here. Because of the\ncontinuing tension in that part of the world, convening\na special international conference on the subject at the\nearliest possible date is necessary.\nIt is also essential to lift the iniquitous embargoes\nimposed on some States, such as Libya, Sudan, Iraq,\nIran, and Cuba. For, not only do these embargoes cause\nsuffering to their people, but they also help to weaken\nworld peace and security.\nThe Republic of China in Taiwan, which has\ndemonstrated sufficiently that it is a democratic and\npeaceful State, is prepared to play its rightful role in\nthe concert of nations, and it should no longer suffer\nfrom the injustice that we are combating each day. That\nis why, in the name of equality among peoples and\nnations, we make an urgent appeal for the readmission\nof the Republic of China to the United Nations.\nTurning to the question of Western Sahara,\nBurkina Faso has always supported United Nations\ninitiatives and efforts here. Accordingly, the recent\nplan proposed by Mr. James Baker, the Personal Envoy\nof the Secretary-General, seems to us to be an\nacceptable political compromise for a constructive\nnegotiating basis.\nOne activity that fuels and sustains conflicts and\nserious banditry in the world is the manufacture, sale\nand circulation of arms and anti-personnel mines.\nBurkina Faso firmly supports the actions taken by the\nUnited Nations aimed at reaching general and complete\ndisarmament, both at the level of weapons of mass\ndestruction and conventional weapons. As for\ncombating the proliferation of light weapons, in\naddition to the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) moratorium to which it subscribes,\nBurkina Faso has set up a high authority responsible\nfor monitoring throughout our national territory the\nimport and use of weapons.\nAfrica has decided to further unite. It has decided\nto bring closer together its peoples and economies and\nto strengthen its partnership with other regions in order\nto better integrate itself in the world economy. The\nAfrican Union was set up precisely to accomplish this\nhuge project. Burkina Faso reiterates here the appeal\nmade by the heads of State and Government of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) for the effective\nsupport of the international community for the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development.\nThe debate in the United Nations should enable\nall Member States to express themselves and contribute\nto the discussion on how best to meet the concerns of\nhumanity. All opinions must be heard and taken into\nconsideration. Decisions taken pursuant to the rules\n3\n\nmust also be applied by each Member State. This is the\nsine qua non requirement for achieving a viable new\ninternational order based on a necessary dialogue\namong civilizations and a culture of sharing and\nsolidarity. This new world order, in order to be more\njust, has to be based on two basic concepts. First of all,\nthere should be a reform of the United Nations to\nprovide a more collective and democratic way of\nmanaging the affairs of the world. Secondly, there\nshould be a more equitable distribution of the world\u2019s\nresources, through revision of trade mechanisms and\nfinancing for development.\nTurning to the reform of the Security Council,\nBurkina Faso reaffirms Africa\u2019s position, which\nresulted from the Harare Summit, advocating equitable\nrepresentation of all regions of the world and\nguaranteeing greater transparency and effectiveness for\nthe United Nations.\nOur world is in constant flux. The ardent desire\nfor peace and security and the search for democracy\nand well-being are, with each passing day, becoming\never more rooted in people\u2019s minds. During the past\nfew years, Burkina Faso has undertaken wide-ranging\npolitical and economic reforms, which are in keeping\nwith the permanent validity of these universal values.\nPolitically, the reforms undertaken by the\nGovernment, based on a consensus approach, have\nenabled it to improve the institutional environment and\nto meet the expectations of the political class and civil\nsociety. This involves in particular the status of the\nopposition, new voting procedures, the single-ballot\nsystem, financing for political parties, trade unions and\nthe private press, and the creation of the Constitutional\nCouncil, the State Council, the Appeals Court, the\nState Audit Office and an independent national\nelectoral commission.\nEconomically speaking, the Government is\nconstantly struggling to improve the living conditions\nof our people. Need I recall that destitution and poverty\nare the first way we deny human rights. They deny\nhuman beings their main raison d\u2019\u00eatre: their dignity.\nTherefore, we have decided to stress the struggle\nagainst poverty and exclusion by working out, with our\ndevelopment partners, a strategic framework to fight\npoverty.\nIn our global village, happiness for everyone is\npossible. The best of possible worlds is within our\ngrasp. Scientific and technological progress means that\nwe can overcome the ills that beset humanity. We\nsimply need to unite, show solidarity and act together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is with\ngreat pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo\non his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President,\nMr. Harri Holkeri. I renew my respects to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the notable and\ncourageous way in which he has continued to fulfil his\nmandate and for the well-deserved award of the Nobel\nPeace Prize to him and to the United Nations.\n18\n\nMy Belgian colleague has already addressed the\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 States members of the\nEuropean Union in a statement with which my country\naligns itself completely. I would, however, like to\nreflect upon certain issues on the international agenda.\nFirst, I cannot fail to refer to the tragic terrorist\nattacks of 11 September against the United States, and\nin particular against the city of New York and innocent\ncitizens of many nationalities. I reiterate our deep\nsorrow and reaffirm our complete solidarity with all\nthose who, like us Portuguese, were victimized by the\nloss of their compatriots and by the suffering of the\nbereaved families.\nWe are dealing with violence without a face,\nviolence that kills indiscriminately and that must be\nconfronted by the international community as a whole,\nirrespective of the religion we practice, the race to\nwhich we belong, the ideology we follow or the\ncivilization into which we were born. It falls to each\nand every State Member of the United Nations to fight\nthis scourge, whose blind hatred has plunged the world\ninto a state of turmoil not seen since the end of the\nSecond World War. What is most shocking to us is the\nfact that we are faced with a force that ignores or\ndespises the very concept of the right to life.\nWe must embark on a concerted effort at all\nlevels to submit to justice those guilty of the crimes\ncommitted, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the\nterrorist acts of September. We believe the United\nNations has an irreplaceable role to play as the source\nof legitimacy for the collective effort of the\ninternational community in the fight against this\ncommon enemy. It is for other forums to complement\nthese actions, orienting and adjusting them in\naccordance with the concrete needs of their respective\nmandates.\nIn this context, I would like to recall that Portugal\nhas supported without reservation the international\nfight against terrorism here in the United Nations, in\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in the\nEuropean Union, in the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in our bilateral\nrelations with the United States and other countries. I\nwould like to assure the Assembly that in its\npresidency of the OSCE next year, Portugal will\nattribute particular priority to this matter.\nIn the light of the current circumstances, I must\nstress the importance of the entire range of\ninternational legislation produced, or awaiting\napproval, under the aegis of the United Nations in the\narea of the fight against terrorism: the 12 conventions\nwhose ratification and implementation make them\ncrucial weapons in preventing and fighting against this\nscourge. Because of its particular significance at this\ntime, I refer specifically to the work of the General\nAssembly on the draft global convention on terrorism.\nThe great efforts made by the great majority of\ndelegations in search of compromise solutions bear\nwitness to a renewed convergence of wills in pursuit of\nthis common goal. We should take advantage of the\ncurrent momentum of collective commitment to reach\nthe speedy completion of this essential instrument.\nPortugal has already signed 11 of the 12\ninternational conventions against terrorism and is\nstrongly committed to fully implementing their\nprovisions. Yesterday we deposited our instrument of\nratification for the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, and shortly we will\ndeposit our instrument of ratification for the Protocol\nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at\nAirports Serving International Civil Aviation. We\nwelcome the adoption of Security Council resolutions\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which are fundamental\ninstruments for the cohesion of the international\ncommunity in its legitimate fight against terrorism. I\nwould also like to highlight the measures contained\ntherein for the fight against terrorist financing \u2014 an\nabsolutely crucial area.\nAs I have already stated, Portugal has supported\nfrom the beginning the international campaign under\nway in Afghanistan, which has been legitimized by the\ndeliberations of the United Nations. Those responsible\nfor the terrorist acts that claimed the lives of thousands\nof innocent civilians on 11 September must be captured\nand tried, and their military infrastructure must be\neliminated. In our view, the principles guiding the\nintervention in Afghanistan should include the\npreservation of territorial integrity and the unity of the\ncountry, as well as the establishment of a broadly\nsupported, multi-ethnic and representative\nGovernment.\nWe believe that, from the very start, the Afghan\npeople should be associated with the reconstruction of\ntheir country, which has been devastated in recent years\nby a brutal regime that is not recognized\ninternationally. The international community should\n19\n\nspare no efforts in alleviating the serious humanitarian\nsituation affecting the Afghan people.\nFinally, let me reiterate that the Portuguese\nGovernment unequivocally supports the efforts\nundertaken by the United Nations, and in particular by\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\nMr. Lakdar Brahimi, in envisioning a transitional\ngovernmental structure and in planning a possible\nUnited Nations mission on the ground. In a post-\nTaliban scenario, the United Nations will be called\nupon to take a decisive role in the reconstruction of\nAfghanistan as well as in the establishment of peaceful\nrelations between Afghanistan and its neighbours.\nThe United Nations plays an indispensable role in\nthe prevention of conflicts, the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the reconstruction\nof territories devastated by war. Numerous conflicts are\nawaiting resolution and constitute a considerable\nchallenge to the international community\u2019s capacity to\nguarantee their peaceful and definitive settlement.\nThe situation in the Middle East, specifically in\nPalestine, is the most worrisome, placing even\ninternational security at risk. The international\ncommunity can spare no efforts to ensure that Israel\nand the Palestinians return to the path of dialogue.\nOnly there will a solution be found that is just, both for\nthe Palestinian people \u2014 who have fought for decades\nfor the recognition of their homeland, an inalienable\nand undeniable right, and for dignified living\nconditions within a sovereign and responsible\nPalestinian State \u2014 and for Israel, which has an equal\nright to live in security in the region and at peace with\nits neighbours.\nAs another example of international conflicts that\ndrag on, apparently with no definitive resolution in\nsight, my country profoundly regrets the continuation\nof the armed conflict in Angola and its severe\nhumanitarian consequences. Portugal reaffirms its\ncommitment to and support for the search for a\npolitical solution to this problem, in line with the\nprovisions of the Acordos de Paz, the Lusaka Protocol\nand the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It\nis essential that the commitments undertaken with\nregard to the international community, and principally\nwith regard to the Angolan people, be respected.\nPortugal encourages the Angolan Government to\nredouble its efforts to achieve national reconciliation.\nWe also encourage the introduction of political and\neconomic reforms in Angola, with a view to\nreinforcing in particular the legitimacy of its\nrepresentative and pluralistic institutions and the\nstrengthening of the credibility of its monetary and\nfinancial structures.\nWe also appeal for a return to political means on\nthe part of those \u2014 such as the sector that inspires the\nmore radical line of UNITA \u2014 that have resorted to\nmethods, namely violence against civilians, that have\nplaced them outside the international community. In\nfact, the absence of constructive proposals \u2014 including\nwith regard to a ceasefire or the cessation of offensive\noperations \u2014 does not contribute to the\nimplementation of possible platforms for dialogue,\nwhich the current situation demands.\nWe praise the important and increasing\ncontribution made by Angolan society, particularly its\nchurches, to peace and reconciliation. We believe that a\nUnited Nations presence in Angola continues to be\nessential and should be encouraged.\nIn that vein, I would like to actively encourage\nthe Secretary-General to intensify all possible efforts to\nrelaunch the peace process in Angola with a view to\nthe adequate implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, so\nthat that great country can finally guarantee tranquillity\nto its citizens and recover its standing and the role to\nwhich it is entitled in international life, fully taking\npart in achieving the objectives of the African\nrenaissance. I am certain that the troika of observer\nStates, as well as the African regional organizations\nand the European Union, will firmly support the\ncontribution of the Secretary-General to a definitive\nresolution of the Angolan issue.\nWhen the international community successfully\nintervenes in a conflict, it should not be turned aside\nfrom the consolidation of the solutions reached. The\nUnited Nations has the responsibility of maintaining an\nappropriate level of involvement until the definitive\nconclusion of the peace process, so as not to put at risk\nthe investments made and expectations created. The\nUnited Nations should proceed without hesitation in\nsupporting the creation of viable nations.\nI welcome the Security Council\u2019s endorsement of\nthis understanding with regard to East Timor, on 31\nOctober. The international community cannot neglect\nthe consolidation of the solutions achieved in East\nTimor, whose transition to independence is, in fact, a\nclear case of success for the United Nations and a\n20\n\nspecial reason for pride for the Community of\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunity\nto underline that this entire process has been conducted\nin an exemplary manner by the United Nations\nTransitional Administration in East Timor under the\nleadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\nThe work of the United Nations towards the\nconsolidation of a new and indisputably sovereign,\ndemocratic and economically viable State only\nreinforces the credibility of the Organization at a time\nin international life when its inspiration and leadership\nare more needed than ever before to correctly manage\nthe great global challenges of the twenty-first century."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection as President of the General Assembly. We are\nespecially pleased that the designation went to a\npersonality with such a remarkable career, a\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea, a country that\nmaintains a friendly relationship and intense\ncooperation with Argentina. I also wish to\nacknowledge the excellent way in which the Foreign\nMinister of Finland, Mr. Harri Holkeri, presided over\nthe Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.\nI would also like to express our satisfaction at the\nre-election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor a second term. This reflects the unanimous support\nof the international community for the way in which he\nhas decisively confronted the great challenges of peace,\nthe rule of law and development at this very difficult\nstage of international life. The support given to him by\nthe Member States reflects the widespread high opinion\nof his efforts and the work of the Organization, which\nwas confirmed by the Nobel Peace Prize, a distinction\nthat brings honour to those who work in the service of\nthe United Nations and to its clear-sighted Secretary-\nGeneral.\nThis distinction also comes at a moment when the\nfull relevance of the United Nations has become\ndramatically urgent as a result of the criminal attacks\nagainst the United States of 11 September. In the face\nof those events, I wish to reiterate our solidarity and\ncommitment with its Government and people. It was an\nattack against us all, against all humankind.\nThose events have shown that terrorism can strike\nat any State and that no country can fight it in isolation.\nIt is an international threat, and the only existing\ninstitution with the global reach, the United Nations,\n21\n\nmust confront that threat within the political and legal\nframework established by the Organization.\nThe Millennium Declaration had already set as\none of its objectives the adoption of concerted\nmeasures against international terrorism and the need\nfor all States to accede as soon as possible to all the\nrelevant international conventions. The adoption of\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\n(2001) and of General Assembly resolution 56/1 shows\nthat the United Nations has been equal to the\ncircumstances, with the goal of using every means\navailable to counter the threat to peace and security\nrepresented by terrorism.\nThe global effort against terrorism is an\nimperative for the international community, one\nblessed by the United Nations. Within the guidelines\napproved by the Organization, all States, groups of\nStates or regional organizations must contribute to this\ncommon struggle.\nArgentina expresses its full commitment to the\nfight against terrorism. Our nation has twice suffered\nattacks of this nature, in 1992 and 1994. The memory\nof those events helps us to understand the grief for\ninnocent victims and to say that this fight is also our\nfight.\nThe recent Security Council and General\nAssembly resolutions have been supplemented by other\ninstruments that reflect the will of the majority of\nStates to define any terrorist act, without exception, as\ncriminal and unjustifiable, no matter what the intended\npurposes. Existing resolutions and conventions have\noutlined a series of specific measures and rules to\nfoster judicial and police cooperation and have\ncriminalized many acts of terrorism, enshrining the\nprinciple that all States have an obligation to prosecute\nand punish the perpetrators.\nArgentina is a party to the majority of the\ninternational treaties in effect and is making progress\non ratifying the remainder, among them the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings, of 1997, and the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism, of 1999. We support the conclusion of the\nconventions currently under consideration that should\nbe finalized before the end of this year, such as the\nconvention on nuclear terrorism. I hope that the\nnegotiations on a convention of a general nature will be\nsuccessfully concluded. The existence of political\ndifferences or different interpretations related to other\nsituations should not distract us from the urgent need to\ndevelop an instrument that would encompass all\naspects of this threat.\nAt the level of the hemisphere, we have put into\npractice the regional system of legitimate defence and\ncollective security established in the Inter-American\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. At the same time, we\nhave fostered the full operation of the Inter-American\nCommittee on Terrorism and the drafting of an inter-\nAmerican convention, that complements existing\nuniversal conventions, as well as the convening of a\nspecial conference on hemispheric security.\nAt the regional level, the countries of the\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR) are\npromoting measures to enhance technical and\noperational coordination, cooperation and assistance\namong the various agencies entrusted with the fight\nagainst terrorism in the field.\nWe must be aware that the approach to this\nproblem will be incomplete if we fail to recognize the\nfactors that nourish terrorism. In the framework of the\nincreasing interdependence that characterizes the\npresent stage of economic life, the benefits of\ndevelopment reach only a few States, and the\nincreasing marginalization of countries and societies\nthat live in extreme poverty, the tragedy of neglected or\nundernourished children, sickness and hunger become\nmore evident. This uneven economic distribution, made\neven more tangible by modern communications, causes\nfrustration in wide sectors of the dispossessed and\ncreates the conditions for the outbreak of conflicts and\nconfrontations, on which fundamentalist movements of\nvarious kinds are at work. This is why we need to\nreaffirm here the fundamental statement made a few\nyears ago by Pope Paul VI: \u201cthe new name for peace is\ndevelopment\u201d.\nThis is a task for the international community as a\nwhole, in a joint effort and a spirit of solidarity. It is\nwrong to minimize the importance of international\ncooperation and to leave on their own those who have\nproblems surviving in the face of global economic\ncompetition.\nThe launching of a new round of negotiations at\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) could be an\nimportant signal to control the increasingly\nprotectionist tendencies and to promote world\neconomic recovery in the short term and growth in the\n22\n\nlong term. It is a signal that will also bring additional\nconfidence to the financial markets. Through the\nlaunching of a new round in Qatar, the 142 member\ncountries of the WTO could give impetus to a process\nthat lays the foundations for a more equitable and\npeaceful world.\nThe persistence of conflicts such as the one in the\nMiddle East is a source of tension, with a wide range of\nrepercussions for the region, causing legitimate\nconcern for the international community. The\nArgentine Republic wishes to renew its expression of\nsupport for a stable and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast, based on respect for the inalienable right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to\nestablish an independent State, as well as recognition\nof the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within\nsafe and internationally recognized borders.\nViolence and terrorism in any form are absolutely\nunacceptable and can only exacerbate the situation.\nThe parties should urgently agree on a ceasefire and\nbegin negotiations on a final settlement, which until\nrecently seemed reachable.\nThe Secretary-General has offered us a road map\nfor implementing the Millennium Declaration, which\nprovides a responsible programme for confronting our\ncurrent serious circumstances. The principal milestones\nof that road map deserve our support as a sound way\ntowards peace-building and strengthening our security:\nthe rule of law to fight terrorism with determination;\nconflict prevention and the strengthening of\npeacekeeping operations; the reform of sanctions\nregimes in order to avoid affecting civilian\npopulations; the eradication of poverty and the\npromotion of development; respect for fundamental\nhuman rights throughout the world and for political and\nreligious plurality; and the firm rejection of any\nattempt to associate certain religious creeds or\nnationalities with violence or terrorism.\nWe also share the Secretary-General\u2019s view of the\nimportance of putting an end to the culture of impunity\nby bringing to trial the perpetrators of extremely\nserious international crimes. We underscore the\nhistorical importance of the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court and we reaffirm our\nsupport for measures to promote its prompt launching.\nThe great majority of humankind desires a future\nof peace and progress. The irrationality and violence of\na minority can be isolated and defeated on the basis of\ncooperation among nations following these general\nprinciples, which we endorsed in the Millennium\nDeclaration, and in regard to which we propose\nconcrete measures today. We trust that we shall be up\nto that challenge.\nI cannot conclude without recalling, as the\nGeneral Assembly already knows, that the Argentine\nRepublic is still engaged in a sovereignty dispute with\nthe United Kingdom over the Malvinas, South Georgias\nand South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding\nmaritime areas. The recovery of the full exercise of\nsovereignty over that part of our national territory,\nrespecting the interests of their inhabitants and\ninternational law, is a precept enshrined in our\nConstitution. This issue is on the agenda of this\nOrganization, which through repeated resolutions has\nasked the Governments of Argentina and the United\nKingdom to resume negotiations on a just and lasting\nsolution to the sovereignty dispute and thus to put an\nend to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833.\nToday, in response to that request, Argentina\nagain reiterates its full readiness to resume bilateral\nnegotiations with the United Kingdom in order to\nresolve the issue, as well as its support for the mission\nof good offices appropriately entrusted to the\nSecretary-General by the General Assembly to assist\nthe parties in achieving that goal.\nI conclude by calling for peace, justice and\nsolidarity, so widely sought by all peoples defending\nlife throughout the world.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. I also take this opportunity to warmly\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand the United Nations on being honoured with the\nNobel Peace Prize.\nThis session of the General Assembly is being\nheld in the shadow of the barbaric terrorist acts of 11\nSeptember, which dramatically reminded us that\nneither distance nor power insulates a State from\nterrorism. Such acts represent an arrogant rejection of\nthe values of freedom and tolerance, which democratic\nand pluralistic societies cherish.\nEven while uniting the nations of the world in\ntheir grief, this terrible tragedy has created the\nopportunity to fashion a determined global response to\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever\nit exists and under whatever name.\nWe in India know from our own bitter experience\nthat terrorists develop global networks driven by\nreligious extremism. Their operations are supported by\ndrug trafficking, money laundering and arms\nsmuggling. Some States follow a policy of sponsoring\nand sheltering them. Terrorists can only be countered\nthrough closely coordinated efforts of the international\ncommunity.\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and\n1373 (2001) are steps in the right direction, but it\nrequires the firm political will of the freedom-loving\nworld to implement them rigorously. The two crucial\nelements in this would be strict curbs on sources of\nfinancing for terrorists and denying them safe havens\nfor training, arming and operation.\nWe must firmly rebuff any ideological, political\nor religious justification for terrorism. We should reject\nself-serving arguments seeking to classify terrorism\naccording to its root causes, and therefore justifying\n32\n\nterrorist action somewhere while condemning it\nelsewhere. Those that advance these arguments should\nexplain what the root causes of the brutal acts of 11\nSeptember were.\nIndia supports the current campaign against the\nterrorist networks in Afghanistan. We hope that it\nreaches an early and successful conclusion. That\ncountry\u2019s current travails can only end with the\nestablishment of a broad-based, representative and\nneutral Government, which would stop the export of\nterrorism and extremism. The international community\nshould work towards this goal, even while the military\ncampaign continues, so that we avoid a political\nvacuum at the end of the campaign.\nWe must recognize that current structures to\nfacilitate a post-Taliban political settlement are\nunrepresentative and therefore ineffective. Located as\nit is in Afghanistan\u2019s neighbourhood, India\u2019s vital\nnational interests are affected by developments in it.\nWe also have traditionally close links with\nAfghanistan. This is the basis for our belief that India\ncan play a useful role in this process.\nThe task of reconstruction in post-conflict\nAfghanistan also merits the urgent attention of the\ninternational community. It would require massive\nexternal assistance to create an economic situation\nconducive to the speedy return and rehabilitation of the\nmillions of Afghans who have taken refuge in other\ncountries of this region. Again India stands ready to\njoin international efforts for this.\nWe have already announced relief assistance of a\nmillion tons of wheat, medicines and medical\nassistance for needy Afghans within, and outside, the\ncountry. We have also pledged $100 million to post-\nconflict Afghanistan for reconstruction. We are\nprepared to do more.\nNearly 6,000 lives were lost on 11 September, but\nthe global economic downturn in its aftermath will take\na far larger human toll, mainly in the developing world.\nThe World Bank has estimated that tens of thousands\nmore children will die worldwide and some 10 million\nmore people are likely to go below the poverty line of\n$1 a day. It is pertinent to reflect on these chilling\nstatistics even as the Ministerial Conference gets under\nway in Doha to consider World Trade Organization\n(WTO) issues. Before we embark on any new\ninitiatives for globalization and sustainable\ndevelopment, we should recognize that political\nsupport for them will be determined primarily by the\nimpact of these regimes on poverty.\nFor most developing countries, the Uruguay\nRound has done little for economic growth, while\npoverty levels and income gaps have worsened.\nGlobalization has constrained developing countries in\nmobilizing public resources for poverty alleviation.\nThat is why public support for the globalization regime\nhas vanished in developing countries. This is also why\nwe have argued strongly that implementation issues\nshould first be resolved before we try to widen the\nWTO agenda further. Our public is unwilling to accept\nanother post-dated cheque, when an earlier one has\nbounced.\nSimilarly, the movement towards sustainable\ndevelopment has proved a disappointment. Developing\ncountries are unable to realize fair payments for their\nsovereign biodiversity resources and traditional\nknowledge. The treaties on climate change and\nbiodiversity have also failed to activate the anticipated\ninvestment and technology transfers to developing\ncountries. Industrialized countries have not shown the\npolitical will to enhance their overseas development\nbudgets. Multilateral development agencies are also\nconstrained in their resources, of which, in any case,\nvery little is available on concessional terms.\nThe inevitable conclusion is that for current\nregimes of globalization and sustainable development\nto be strengthened, or even to survive, they must be re-\nengineered to generate large-scale finances for poverty\nalleviation. The passion for globalization has to be\ntempered by compassion for its victims. Sadly, this\nthought has not penetrated into the thinking of the\ndeveloped economies. Their actions also do not reflect\nthe realization that there cannot be a sustainable revival\nof their own sluggish economies unless the\nglobalization and sustainable development priorities\nare re-oriented and anchored in the developmental\nneeds of two-thirds of the global population.\nA year ago, I suggested in my speech to the\nUnited States Congress a comprehensive global\ndialogue on development. The aim of such a dialogue\nwould be to address the highly unstable situation in\nwhich one-third of the world\u2019s population lives in\nluxury and condemns the remaining two-thirds to\npoverty and want. It is a fertile breeding ground for\npolitical unrest, economic chaos and social fractures.\n33\n\nIndia would be happy to coordinate this dialogue,\nwith the immediate objective of mobilizing resources\nfor poverty alleviation programmes in developing\ncountries. A preliminary agenda for the dialogue could\ninclude the accelerated liquidation of external debts of\nlow-income and highly indebted countries; poverty\nalleviation programmes specifically aimed at\ndeveloping countries facing financial crises;\nstabilization of international prices of primary\ncommodity exports; and, most importantly, welfare and\ndevelopment programmes for all the world\u2019s needy\nchildren \u2014 for their nutrition, health, education and\nprotection from degrading and hazardous employment.\nThe struggle for equitable development and the\nwar against poverty are as important as our campaign\nagainst terrorism and our collective search for security.\nAt a time when an external stimulus has motivated us\nto unite against terrorism and for security, let us\nsummon an equally strong inner resolve for\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation. They are just as\ncrucial for a global order at peace with itself.\nThis fundamental and seamless linkage between\npeace, security and development can be recalled in the\nsage words of the great Indian poet Rabindranath\nTagore:\n\u201cFrom now onward, any nation that takes an\nisolated view of its own interests will run\ncontrary to the spirit of the New Age, and will\nknow no peace. From now onward, the anxiety\nthat each country has for its own safety must\nembrace the welfare of the whole world.\u201d\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start by\ncongratulating the United Nations and its Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on being awarded the Nobel\nPeace Prize. This is an extremely well-deserved award\nto a unique Organization and a unique Secretary-\nGeneral.\nLet me also take this opportunity to express my\nsincere condolences to the families of the victims of\nyesterday\u2019s tragedy near John F. Kennedy Airport.\nWe are all going through days of sorrow and\nanger: sorrow for human suffering, for the loss of\nhuman lives and for loss of security; anger, because\nterrorists hit innocent people and because terror is\ntargeted at openness and democracy and threatens our\ncommon security and welfare.\nSeldom has the international community been\nchallenged as it was through the terrorist acts of 11\nSeptember. The United Nations rose to the challenge\nand took the lead in the struggle against international\nterrorism. Seldom have we \u2014 the peoples of the United\nNations \u2014 shown such a strong common reaction and\nunity. Sweden stands wholeheartedly by the United\nNations in its call to fight terrorism, and we express\nour solidarity with the American people and\nGovernment at this difficult time.\nWe have now three immediate tasks. First, all\nnations have to take action against terrorism, as stated\nin Security Council resolution 1373 (2001): action\nagainst the financing, planning and execution of\nterrorist acts; and action that makes it clear to those\nresponsible for terror that they will be punished for\ntheir acts.\nWe support the right of the United States\nGovernment to self-defence, in accordance with\ninternational law. We emphasize the central role of the\nSecurity Council.\nSecondly, we must assist the people of\nAfghanistan in their immediate needs. The Afghan\npeople have suffered war, natural disasters and\noppression for decades. They are held hostage by an\nillegitimate regime. Women and children are\nsystematically abused. Women are denied health care\nand work; girls are practically denied education; and\ntheir freedom is heavily restricted. Human rights do not\nexist under Taliban rule. It is crucial that in all cities\nnow liberated from the Taliban human rights and law\nand order be guaranteed.\nThe humanitarian situation facing the people of\nAfghanistan is acute. The United Nations and all its\nMember States must increase their efforts to meet the\nneeds of the Afghan population. Closed borders must\nbe opened immediately, both for refugees who seek\nasylum and for the secure transport of emergency\nsupplies.\nThirdly, we must assist the people of Afghanistan\nin the reconstruction of their country. The restoration\nof this ravaged nation to a state of peaceful coexistence\nmust involve a political process leading to a\nrepresentative government that respects human rights\nand fosters democratic development. The role,\nprotection and participation of women must be high on\nevery policy agenda.\nWhile addressing these immediate tasks, we must\nnot lose sight of our long-term agenda.\nA year ago, here in New York, heads of State and\nGovernment from 147 countries adopted the\nMillennium Declaration. Their message was clear: only\nby working together can we meet the challenges of\nglobalization.\n33\n\nToday we need to build coalitions and to join\nforces, not only against international terrorism, but also\nto fight other global problems. We need to join forces\nin the fight for global justice. Globalization and\nopenness make people aware of what they have, and of\nwhat they lack. People wish to participate. People wish\nto share the benefits of development. This is positive\nand represents a challenge to the international\ncommunity\u2019s ability to narrow the gap between rich\nand poor.\nGlobalization creates wealth, but that wealth must\nbe more equally distributed. Today, more than one\nbillion people live in absolute poverty. The Millennium\nSummit pledged to halve poverty by the year 2015.\nThis is a welcome commitment, but it is still not\nenough. Political efforts should be combined with\neconomic, technical and scientific progress.\nDevelopment cooperation, trade and agricultural\npolicies must aim at poverty eradication. The\ninstruments are there, and the possibilities today are\nbetter than ever before, but we, the Governments, need\nto show courage and political will. We must provide\nhope of freedom for the oppressed, education for the\nilliterate, food for the hungry, health care for the sick\nand equality for women.\nIncreased official development assistance is\ntherefore crucial. Sweden is one of the few countries\nmeeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\ngross national income in development aid. I urge all\ndeveloped countries, in particular the big economic\nPowers, to make real progress towards achieving this\ngoal.\nThe poorer countries must be integrated into the\nworld economy, and the new United Nations road map\nis a concrete and welcome step in this direction. The\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico, and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\nJohannesburg \u2014 in which the Swedish Prime Minister,\nMr. G\u00f6ran Persson, will participate \u2014 could be the\nstarting points for new partnership arrangements\nbetween Government institutions, civil society and the\nprivate sector \u2014 a partnership for global justice.\nHIV/AIDS is one of the greatest threats to\nhumanity in our time. In some countries, large parts of\nentire generations fall victim to the disease. Millions of\nchildren are orphaned. Economic progress is hampered,\nand development opportunities are lost. All Member\nStates must show strong political and financial\ncommitment and solidarity. Sweden welcomes the new\nglobal fund to fight HIV/AIDS and will contribute $60\nmillion over the next three years to the fund.\nA new round of broad negotiations in the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) can make an important\ncontribution to worldwide growth and development.\nBut the interests and concerns of the developing\ncountries must be properly addressed. Every effort\nmust be made to liberalize trade. The example set by\nthe European Union \u2014 to open its market to\n\u201ceverything but arms\u201d \u2014 should be followed by others.\nDeveloping countries should receive support in\nbuilding their capacity to fully integrate into the world\ntrading system and the global economy.\nThe global responsibility in terms of providing\nmore resources and greater market access to\ndeveloping countries is clear. But the main\nresponsibility for development rests with the\nGovernments and peoples in developing countries.\nGood governance and sound national policies are\nprerequisites for sustained development and poverty\nreduction.\nWe need to join forces in the struggle for human\nrights and democracy. When rights are respected, when\nvoices are heard, when society is tolerant, society also\nbecomes safer for all.\nViolations of human rights threaten the security\nand well-being not only of the individual but also of\nsociety, and they cause tensions and conflicts.\nSustainable development and political stability can be\nbuilt only on respect for universal and indivisible\nhuman rights and on democratic development.\nDiscrimination in any form is unacceptable and\nincompatible with these fundamental principles. It is\nthe responsibility of every Government to safeguard\nequal rights and opportunities for men and women, as\nwell as the rights of the child.\nThose guilty of human rights violations and\ncrimes against humanity should never find refuge\nbehind national borders. The transfer of Mr. Milosevic\nto the International Tribunal demonstrates the resolve\nof the international community to act against impunity.\nIt carries great symbolic value and will contribute to\nthe process of reconciliation.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt will strengthen our ability to try suspected\n34\n\nviolators of international and humanitarian law. It is a\nmatter of the highest priority to have the Court\noperational promptly, and I urge those States which\nhave not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute.\nSweden also welcomes the initiative by the\nSecretary-General to involve global business in\npromoting human rights through the Global Compact.\nWe need to join forces to prevent violent\nconflicts. We need to work against hatred and suspicion\nbetween peoples and to stimulate a dialogue between\nand within cultures. Preventing violent conflict is a\nprimary obligation of Member States under the United\nNations Charter, but it took us half a century to start\nworking towards this goal systematically. We now have\na better understanding of the complex root causes of\nconflicts. The responsibility of preventing conflict\nultimately rests on every Government. Successful long-\nterm prevention cannot be imposed from the outside,\nbut the local parties should be encouraged and assisted\nin containing an emerging conflict.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report on conflict\nprevention is a very valuable contribution to the\ndevelopment of a global strategy. I urge all Member\nStates to take an active part in its follow-up.\nA core task of the United Nations is to effectively\nmanage conflicts where prevention fails. It is the\nUnited Nations that provides the legal foundation for\nglobal action. Sweden therefore strongly supports the\nprocess that the Brahimi report has set in motion. But\nwe, the Member States, have yet to provide the United\nNations with the necessary resources to strengthen its\ncapacities in the area of peace operations.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to strengthen the\nties between the United Nations and regional\norganizations in the areas of conflict prevention and\npeace-building are most welcome.\nCooperation with the United Nations is essential\nin developing the European Union\u2019s conflict-\nprevention and crisis-management capabilities. In\nG\u00f6teborg last June the Union adopted a framework for\nincreased interaction, so that European Union\ncapacities can provide real added value for the United\nNations.\nWe need to join forces for peace in the Middle\nEast. Our aim must be two States, Israel and Palestine,\nwith secure and recognized borders. The basis is\ninternational law and the Security Council resolutions.\nThe situation has deteriorated in the past year, despite\nstrong efforts by the United Nations, the United States,\nthe European Union, Russia and others. A further\nescalation must be avoided. Israel must withdraw from\nthe occupied territories, cease the settlements policy\nand put an end to the extrajudicial executions. The\nPalestinians must do everything in their power to stop\nthe attacks against innocent civilians. Sweden strongly\nsupports the recommendations of the Mitchell report,\nincluding a monitoring mechanism, for an end to\nviolence and a revival of the peace process.\nWe must join forces for multilateral disarmament.\nA world free from weapons of mass destruction would\nbe a much safer world. Multilateral agreements\ncontribute to security for the individual. They have\nproduced impressive results \u2014 chemical and biological\nweapons have been totally banned. Still, however,\nmany challenges remain.\nThree years ago, Sweden helped launch the New\nAgenda Coalition \u2014 a group of States concerned with\nthe lack of progress in nuclear disarmament and\nsharing a vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world. In our\ncase, the initiative was rooted in the firm belief that\nboth global and national security depend on\nmultilateral frameworks and platforms.\nLast year, the 187 States parties to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) adopted by consensus a\nroad map towards nuclear disarmament. Based on the\nundertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to fully\neliminate their nuclear arsenals, a 12-step action plan\nwas agreed on. This promising outcome was also\nconfirmed by the General Assembly. All States parties\nhave pledged to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world\nunder strict and effective international control. I\nstrongly urge the four States remaining outside the\nTreaty to sign and ratify it.\nWe have a number of important instruments to\nprevent testing, to ban production of weapons material\nand to improve verification. The Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty and the Additional Protocol to the International\nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement pave the\nway for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\nNow it is now time to concentrate on their\nimplementation.\nThe United States plans for a strategic missile\ndefence system risk having a negative impact on\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the whole NPT\n35\n\nprocess. The ongoing consultations are welcome, but\nthe outcome is still uncertain. We strongly believe that\nthe new threats of proliferation require a multilateral\nresponse built on the already existing safety net.\nDeep cuts in strategic and tactical nuclear\narsenals are long overdue and should be accompanied\nby effective mechanisms of verification and\nirreversibility. Such treaty agreements can never be\nreplaced by unilateral declarations.\nWeapons of mass destruction remain a threat to\nmankind. Terrorists must not be given the opportunity\nto threaten us with these weapons. Now is the time to\nreinforce efforts to contain proliferation.\nThe United Nations remains a unique global\nforum. It is the one organization we can all equally\ncount on and turn to for security and development \u2014 as\nthe safeguard of our common future. The United\nNations needs to be strengthened, and it needs reform.\nWe need the United Nations, and the United Nations\nneeds us.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet\nme express our deep sadness at the human loss\nresulting from the crash this morning of an American\naircraft in a Queens neighbourhood and our\ncondolences to the families of the victims.\nI wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo and his\nfriendly country on his election as President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let me\nalso pay tribute to his predecessor for his able\nstewardship of the last session.\nFurthermore, I extend warm congratulations to\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-\n26\n\nelection for a second term of office, as well as on his\nwell-deserved award, jointly with the United Nations,\nof the Nobel Peace Prize. That was an\nacknowledgement of Mr. Annan\u2019s remarkable track\nrecord in serving the purposes and principles of the\nCharter and a symbolic token of recognition of the\ncentrality and relevance of the vital role of the United\nNations in the world community.\nThis great city which hosts our world\nOrganization and the United States of America and its\npeople have been struck by a cowardly terrorist attack\nthat targeted innocent civilians. In truth, this act of\naggression was committed not just against the United\nStates but, in fact, against the entire international\ncommunity and humanity. For it seems that the larger\nobjective of the evil and dark forces that planned and\nexecuted those atrocities was the terrorization and\nintimidation of all of us and the precipitation of a\nworldwide cultural and religious confrontation. Their\naim was to undermine and shatter our sense of common\nconfidence and the bonds that unite us by stripping us\nof our own sense of security and driving us to deal with\neach other in an atmosphere of mistrust, fear and\nhatred.\nOne of the many painful impacts of those terrorist\nattacks is the demonstration of the depth of\ninterdependence in our modern life. The repercussions\nwent beyond the United States. The victims belonged\nto dozens of nations, including Jordan, and all of us\nalmost instantly felt the negative economic effects.\nThus the fight against terrorism should be\ncomprehensive. This means forging a unity of purpose\nand determination to win this war on all fronts. It also\nmeans exercising care and caution so that we do not\nfall into the trap set by the terrorists. Indeed, our war\nagainst terrorism is neither a religious war nor a clash\nbetween one civilization and another \u2014 or even\nbetween one nation and another.\nLast 11 September, Jordan reaffirmed its long-\nstanding and clear position, which is anchored in its\nfirm policy of rejecting the use of terrorism in\ninternational relations, irrespective of any argument\nadvanced, pretext invoked or label given. Thus, His\nMajesty King Abdullah II declared Jordan\u2019s categorical\ncondemnation of the terrorist attacks perpetrated\nagainst the United States and Jordan\u2019s support for the\ninternational effort against terrorism. In the same vein,\nHis Majesty expressed resolve to safeguard the sanctity\nof the Islamic faith from any abuse or distortion caused\nby terrorism or terrorists, insisting that terrorists must\nbe deprived of any opportunity to hijack religion and to\nmisuse it to serve their purposes or advance their\nagenda. In particular, terrorists must be barred from\nprovoking a confrontation between Islam and the rest\nof the world.\nThe suppression and defeat of those pernicious\nschemes require, among other things, the enhancement\nof understanding among peoples and cultures. They\nalso demand a genuine respect for cultural diversity.\nHuman pluralism should, ideally, be a force of\nenrichment and inspiration for the community of\nnations. The world is perhaps pressed now more than\never to launch a meaningful dialogue among\ncivilizations that highlights common denominators\nwith a view to promoting tolerance and reinforcing our\nability to coexist and interact in peace and harmony.\nThe United Nations system remains the appropriate\nframework and venue for such a dialogue.\nIslam and Muslims throughout history have\nenriched human civilization. The contributions of\nMuslim scholars in science, literature and culture in\ngeneral reached the heights they did due to a climate of\nopen-mindedness, tolerance and pluralism established\nby Islam.\nWe in Jordan take pride in the true coexistence\nand integration of our community life, which has been\nfashioned over the past 14 centuries. Muslims and\nChristians live side by side in national unity, where\nreligious pluralism is an enriching factor, making\nJordanian society a good example of social harmony\nand interaction.\nTerrorism will exploit political, economic and\nsocial imbalances and the absence of justice to advance\nits goals. Therefore, addressing the main causes of\ndespair, frustration and sense of injustice in a serious\nmanner is perhaps the most effective way to confront\nterrorism and pre-empt its potential appeal and support.\nWe recognize that a truly effective international\neffort to eradicate terrorism primarily requires, as far as\nthe Middle East region is concerned, a just and\nacceptable resolution of the question of Palestine,\nwhose long-running implications on the ground remain\nthe chief source of pain and suffering across the region.\nThe current situation of constant killings and\ndestruction as a result of Israel\u2019s practices of using\n27\n\nforce against the Palestinian people and the siege of\ntheir towns and communities constitute a constant\nincitement that feeds escalation in a way that endangers\nsecurity and stability throughout the whole region.\nJordan firmly believes that the resolution of this\nconflict will not be possible by the use of force or by\nsecurity and coercive measures. There is really no\nalternative before the two sides but to return to the\nnegotiating table as equal partners and to seek a\nsettlement that ensures their legitimate rights and their\nfuture. This option will remain elusive until parallel\nmutual steps are adopted on the basis of the accords\nand obligations agreed upon by both the Palestinian\nand Israeli sides.\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II has been engaged\nin enormous efforts to help the region break out of the\nvicious circle engulfing it because of the ongoing\nconfrontations between the two sides. King Abdullah\nhas contributed positively to the intense international\ncontacts and efforts to achieve that goal. Those\nendeavours have indeed led to the building of a full\ninternational consensus on the requirements needed to\nbreak the current deadlock. Those requirements\ninclude, in the first place, ending the use of the Israeli\nmilitary machine against the Palestinian people, lifting\nthe blockade imposed on them and abandoning the\npolicy of assassinations and incursions into areas under\nthe control of the Palestinian National Authority.\nImplementing those steps would set out an\nappropriate entry to start the implementation of the\nrecommendations of the Mitchell Commission, the\nthrust of which is to create favourable conditions that\nallow return to the negotiating table.\nTen years after the Madrid Peace Conference, the\nregion is seething with frustration over the failure to\nreach the long-awaited peace. People there are no\nlonger satisfied by the mere existence of a peace\nprocess. Therefore, the revival of the peace process in\nitself is no longer tenable in the absence of a genuinely\nmeaningful effort that translates into concrete progress\non the road to peace.\nProlonged confrontations have resulted not only\nin the failure to carry out several obligations agreed\nupon, but also in retreating from undertakings that\nwere already in place. This demonstrates that phased\nand interim agreements are inadequate and ineffective\nto address the status quo. Therefore, starting the final\nstatus negotiations has become now a pressing priority\nin order to achieve the principal objective of the peace\nprocess, namely, the fulfilment of the national rights of\nthe Palestinian people and the establishment of their\nviable independent State in their homeland, as well as\nthe guaranteeing of the security of Israel.\nPeace that can be acceptable to the peoples of the\nregion must be comprehensive in terms of resolving, on\nthe one hand, the whole array of major issues: the\noccupied territories, Jerusalem, the refugees, security\nand weapons of mass destruction, and economic\ncooperation; and including on the other, all tracks and\nthe States concerned.\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973) remain the basis of the peace process. Their\nimplementation requires putting in place the true\ncomponents of peace: primarily, the renunciation of the\nsettlement policy which contradicts the \u201cland for\npeace\u201d principle and which is in itself a flagrant breach\nof international law. Peace and settlements are\nmutually exclusive.\nHoly Jerusalem is key to peace. It is an occupied\nPalestinian territory subject to the application of\nresolution 242 (1967), which aims at achieving Israeli\nwithdrawal therefrom and from the rest of the\nPalestinian territories \u2014 occupied in 1967 \u2014 so that\nJerusalem will become the capital of the State of\nPalestine. In addition, an appropriate formula will have\nto be worked out to ensure that the entire city of\nJerusalem will be open, freedom of worship for all will\nbe safeguarded and the city will be a factor of unity\nand reconciliation among all believers in God.\nThe issue of refugees represents the worst form of\ninjustice and frustration in the conflict. Justice must be\nsecured for the Palestinian refugees in order to\neliminate the greatest source of frustration and\nsuffering in the region. Jordan, time and again, has\nmade clear its firm position in relation to the question\nof refugees here in the Assembly. Let me emphasize\nthat Jordan will accept only a solution to the question\nof refugees that takes fully into account its rights and\ninterests as a State, as well as the rights and interests of\nits citizens, on the basis of international law and all\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\nLack of trust between the two sides precludes\ntheir ability to achieve any progress without an active\ninvolvement by a third party. Jordan welcomes\nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s announcement endorsing a\nsolution that ensures the existence of two States,\n28\n\nincluding the establishment of a Palestinian State on\nthe Palestinian territory currently occupied by Israel, in\naccordance with relevant Security Council resolutions.\nThis announcement completes the international\nconsensus on the fundamental requirement for\nachieving peace in the region. It is our hope that the\nUnited States efforts will continue with support from\nthe countries of the European Union, the Russian\nFederation and the international community as a whole\nin order to reach that goal.\nA comprehensive peace must include Israeli\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian territories to the\nborder of 4 June 1967 and the completion of its\nwithdrawal from the remaining occupied Lebanese\nterritories on the basis of relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nThe suffering of Iraq and its people, due to the\ninternational sanctions imposed against them for more\nthan 11 years, is yet another source of frustration and\ntension in the region. Jordan once again stresses the\nneed to lift those sanctions and the importance of\ncreating conditions that will allow Iraq to reclaim its\nactive regional and international role. Jordan also\nemphasizes the importance of completing the\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including those relating to Kuwaiti\nprisoners and other missing persons.\nWe hope to see an end soon to the plight of the\npeople of Afghanistan so that that nation and its\npolitical forces can agree on a form of government to\nrepresent it. We also hope that the world community\nwill mount a genuine effort to assist the people of\nAfghanistan in facing the tragic economic conditions\nthat have been afflicting them for many years.\nAt this juncture in human history, when we are\nseeing a surge in global challenges, it becomes even\nmore imperative to rally around the United Nations and\nto comply more faithfully with the purposes and\nprinciples of its Charter, especially those relating to the\npeaceful resolution of disputes on the basis of\ninternational law.\nIt is also important not to abandon our collective\ngoals in terms of promoting peace, economic\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. This\ntrilateral platform of action represents Jordan\u2019s\ndomestic and foreign agenda.\nOur relentless pursuit of a just peace in our region\nhas not disrupted our determined efforts to seek\neconomic, social and political development. To the\ncontrary, Jordan is now poised to embark on a new,\nintegrated enterprise that seeks more economic growth\nin order to improve the living conditions of its\npopulation and to open up new vistas of hope and\npromise for our future generations. Indeed, the dignity\nand welfare of the individual must always remain the\nnoblest goal of our national and international\nendeavours.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI join with other\ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his\nelection to chair the proceedings of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I also take this\nopportunity to express my deep satisfaction at the\naward of this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize to the United\nNations and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. It is a\nwell-deserved vote of confidence in the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s leadership as well as recognition of the\npivotal role being played by the United Nations in an\nera of immense challenge for the international\ncommunity during these early years of the twenty-first\ncentury. We are greatly reassured that his firm guidance\nwill continue for a further term to shape the direction\nof the Organization.\nAt this time of renewed sadness for the people of\nNew York and of the Dominican Republic, may I also\noffer my deepest condolences to the families and\nfriends of those who lost their lives in Monday\u2019s tragic\ncrash of American Airlines flight 587.\nFor all of us, this year\u2019s journey to New York to\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session\nstands in stark contrast to the comfortable annual\nroutine we have grown to appreciate. We come instead\nto a city behind barricades, a people traumatized and\nbewildered, a mood of foreboding and uncertainty on\nthe streets and in these corridors. The horror of\nterrorism \u2014 one that has scarred innocent lives for\ndecades in the Middle East, in Northern Ireland and\nother parts of Europe, in Asia, in Africa and in Latin\nAmerica \u2014 has now landed on these shores with a fury\nand intensity that few of us would have thought\npossible.\nThe Government of Barbados has been explicit\nand unequivocal in its condemnation of the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September and has pledged to cooperate\nfully with the international community in the sustained\neffort to respond to this global threat. No cause or\ngrievance can ever justify the use of violence as a\nmeans of settling disputes or legitimize the taking of\ninnocent lives. The use of terrorism is incompatible\nwith the ideals of the United Nations and cannot be\nallowed to prevail.\nBarbados shares America\u2019s grief, for we have lost\nfive proud and hard-working citizens to this senseless\ncarnage. We share America\u2019s bewilderment and\ndisbelief, for our citizens, too, have experienced that\nsense of violation and loss of innocence that comes\nwith an unprecedented terrorist strike. Twenty-five\nyears ago, on 6 October 1976, the unthinkable\nhappened to Barbados with the terrorist downing of a\nCubana Airlines flight just outside our territorial\nwaters. Although the masterminds of that attack were\nidentified and apprehended, they were never punished\nfor their crime, but were instead encouraged to remain\nactively engaged in their campaign of terror. We share\nAmerica\u2019s sense of outrage and determination to bring\nthe perpetrators of the 11 September attacks to justice.\nWe must also insist that there be zero tolerance for\nterrorism, whatever its source or ideology.\nTerrorism is a global problem which requires a\nglobal solution. For many years, the United Nations\nhas recognized the threat which terrorism poses to the\npromotion and maintenance of world peace. Since\n1963, when this Organization adopted its first anti-\nterrorism convention, some 12 related conventions\nhave been approved by the international community.\nBarbados is a party to seven of these instruments.\nEarlier this week, I had the honour of signing the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Financing. Our Government is actively\nreviewing the remaining conventions and their\nadministrative and legislative implications with a view\nto providing for early adherence.\nBarbados is committed to taking all necessary\nmeasures to minimize the risk of terrorist acts being\nperpetrated or financed in or from its national territory.\nA thorough review of security has been undertaken at\nour airport and seaport, and our authorities have taken\nimmediate action to ensure compliance with the\nenhanced International Civil Aviation Organization and\nFederal Aviation Administration guidelines issued after\n11 September. We have also taken legislative action to\nfurther strengthen our already well-regulated financial\nservices regime through amendments to the Money\nLaundering (Prevention and Control) Act and the\nMutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Within the\nCaribbean Community we have agreed to increase\ncooperation in intelligence-gathering, analysis and\ndissemination among our security and enforcement\npersonnel. We expect shortly to be in a position to\nreport in detail to the Security Council on measures\ntaken in compliance with the terms of resolution 1373\n(2001).\nJust as we agree that terrorism is a global\nphenomenon to which no country can consider itself\n13\n\nimmune, so too must we understand that it is a complex\nproblem necessitating a multidimensional response. As\nthe Secretary-General has so aptly put it in the 44th\nmeeting, in his opening statement of the general\ndebate:\n\u201cWe face two possible futures: a mutually\ndestructive clash between so-called civilizations\nbased on the exaggeration of religious and\ncultural differences, or a global community,\nrespecting diversity and rooted in universal\nvalues. The latter must be our choice, but we can\nachieve it only if we bring real hope to the\nbillions now trapped in poverty, conflict and\ndisease.\u201d\nWe must all accept that the struggle against\nterrorism can never hope to succeed if it is viewed\nsimply as a military campaign to strike at the power\nbase of the latest practitioners of terror. It must also\nseek to find effective and lasting solutions to the\nproblems of underdevelopment, poverty and\ndeprivation, inequality, intolerance and injustice that\nmarginalize so large a percentage of the world\u2019s\npopulation. For it is from these conditions of\nhopelessness and despair that spring new converts to\nthe cause of terrorism.\nThe events of 11 September and the extent to\nwhich they have had an impact on the economic\nfortunes of all of our countries have shown us the other\nface of globalization: the reality of our growing\neconomic interdependence. Now more than ever, there\nis a need to recognize the value of multilateralism and\nthe pre-eminent role of the United Nations in the\nsearch for lasting solutions to the challenges that will\nconfront us in the early years of the twenty-first\ncentury. The importance of giving priority to a\nrevitalized development agenda cannot be overstated.\nIn this regard, Barbados looks to the International\nConference on Financing for Development as a\nconstructive forum for refocusing the dialogue on\neffective mechanisms for the implementation of the\nstalled development agenda. We agree there is need to\nreform the international economic and financial\narchitecture to meet the current development\nchallenges. We are pleased that international tax\ncooperation will be one of the issues discussed at the\nConference.\nMany developing countries, including Barbados,\nwere encouraged to diversify into the financial services\nsector as a viable development alternative and now\nderive a significant proportion of their national revenue\nfrom that source. We therefore continue to insist on the\nneed for universal participation in decisions that affect\nthe operation of this sector.\nBarbados is far advanced in the implementation\nof its national commitments under Agenda 21. We\nbelieve that the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment presents an important opportunity to\nbuild a new and expanded relationship with our\ndevelopment partners for the full implementation of\ncommitments already undertaken at Rio. Johannesburg\nshould not merely review the status of progress of Rio,\nbut should also outline strategies for dealing decisively\nwith the sustainable development challenges that have\nemerged since 1992. For all small island developing\nStates, follow-up of the Barbados Programme of\nAction will form an integral part of this process.\nNaturally, the Caribbean Basin countries will\ncontinue their efforts to create a special regime for the\nCaribbean Sea with the ultimate goal of achieving its\nrecognition as a special area in the context of\nsustainable development.\nIt is no secret that the efforts towards the creation\nof a new international trading system have resulted in\nbitter disappointment for the majority of developing\ncountries, which have been severely disadvantaged by\nthe imbalance of rights, obligations, benefits and\nconcessions agreed at Uruguay, and by the failure of\nSeattle to address that imbalance. We hope that the\nDoha decision to launch a new round will lead to a\nmeaningful resolution of these critical developing\ncountry concerns. We are convinced that sustained\neconomic and social progress for the developing world\nwill be achievable only within the framework of a fair,\nequitable and inclusive trading arrangement that gives\ndue recognition to the differences in size and level of\ndevelopment of Member States.\nWe welcome the agreement on drug patents,\nwhich represents a major victory for the efforts of\ndeveloping countries to respond to their priority public\nhealth needs and is of great significance in the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\nThe impact of the 11 September events on the\nCaribbean has been immediate and severe. The\neconomic repercussions have served to emphasize the\nextreme fragility and vulnerability of our small States\nin the international economy. The countries of the\n14\n\nCaribbean Community, whose economies are heavily\ndependent on tourism and financial services, have\njoined forces to coordinate a regional emergency\nresponse and recovery strategy to mitigate the effects\nof the crisis.\nIt is clear, however, that responses at the national\nand regional levels alone will be inadequate to deal\nwith the magnitude of this unprecedented situation. In\nthe words of the Prime Minister of Barbados, the Right\nHonourable Owen Arthur:\n\u201cthe international financial community has\ntraditionally required developing countries to rely\nheavily on policy responses to deal with\neconomic crisis. But the situation that we face has\nnot been caused by policy failure, recklessness or\nfinancial excesses by developing countries.\n\u201cPolicy responses without the commitment\nof real financial resources will therefore not\nsuffice. Barbados therefore stands ready to\nsupport a well-conceived response from the\ninternational financial community to the crisis at\nhand.\u201d\nIt is the mission of the United Nations to promote\nthe peaceful coexistence and the political, social and\neconomic welfare of the world\u2019s peoples. It is in this\ncontext that we must recognize the significance of the\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nand renew our confidence in the capacity of\nmultilateral organizations to resolve differences and\npromote a sense of shared values. This Conference\npresented a unique opportunity for countries to take a\nproactive approach in defusing both historic and\ncontemporary conflicts and in coming to terms with the\ninjustices of the past and creating new understandings\nfor the future.\nWe regret that in many respects the Conference\ndid not get the serious high-level attention it deserved\nand that the treatment of its fundamental issues was\nless wide-ranging and definitive than we would have\nwished. In the words of Professor Hilary Beckles, of\nthe Barbados delegation:\n\u201cThe crisis of modernity that finds expression in\nspiralling racial hatred, xenophobia and related\nintolerance is not the sole burden of any one part\nof the global community, even though the victims\nof the crimes of which I speak continue to feel in\nthe course of everyday life the kind of pain and\nanguish not easily imagined by others.\u201d\nThe citizens of the Caribbean are a transplanted\npeople, who have forged from the crucible of slavery,\ncolonialism and economic exploitation a vibrant,\npluralistic, multiracial society built on tolerance and\nrespect for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. In\nthese difficult times, we believe that there is much that\ncan be learned from our experiences and much that can\nbe done to promote the culture of peace and\nunderstanding, especially among the youth. In this\nregard, Barbados attaches importance to the early\nconvening of the General Assembly special session on\nchildren and to a rededication of efforts to achieve the\ninternational development targets already set.\nWe would do well to remember that, in the words\nof the Secretary-General, \u201cnone of the issues that faced\nus on 10 September has become less urgent\u201d. Indeed, it\nwould be an unfortunate irony if the global response to\nterrorism were conducted in such a manner \u2014 through\nthe massive redeployment of resources from other\npriorities, such as the fight against narcotics\ntrafficking, extreme poverty, disease and environmental\ndegradation \u2014 as to further exacerbate the economic,\npolitical and cultural instabilities which are the primary\nbreeding ground for terrorism.\nSmall countries like my own are not part of the\nproblem, but we are nevertheless required to be part of\nthe solution, in circumstances that place a\ndisproportionate burden on our financial, human and\nadministrative resources, which had already been\nstruggling to respond to the global economic recession.\nBarbados remains fully committed to the United\nNations system and to the values it seeks to promote.\nWe are keenly aware of the important work the United\nNations continues to carry out in the eastern Caribbean.\nWe are pleased to provide tangible support for that\nwork through the provision of purpose-built\nheadquarters to house the seven agencies whose\nsubregional offices are located in Bridgetown. We will\ncontinue to work closely with the agencies in\ndeveloping a model partnership for eastern Caribbean\ndevelopment.\nIn this context, we welcome the support of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, in\npartnership with the International Monetary Fund and\nthe Government of Canada, for the Caribbean\nTechnical Assistance Centre, which was inaugurated\n15\n\nlast week in Barbados. We look forward to similar\nlevels of United Nations cooperation for other\nimportant programmes, in particular that of the United\nNations International Drug Control Programme\n(UNDCP), whose work is providing critical support to\nthe region in an extremely volatile international\neconomic and security environment.\nTwo years ago, the Prime Minister of Barbados\nemphasized that we were leaving the twentieth century\nand entering the twenty-first conscious of the dangers,\nbut excited by the prospects. Recent events must not be\nallowed to dampen our optimism. We must remain firm\nin the hope that humanity possesses the fortitude and\ndetermination to triumph in the face of extreme\nadversity, and that respect for diversity, human dignity\nand the sanctity of human life will prevail.\nWe are not expected to complete this task, but\nneither are we at liberty to abstain from it.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bid the Assembly welcome\nfrom the people of Nauru, the pleasant little island of\nthe Pacific. Let me avail myself of the opportunity to\nextend to you, Sir, my Government\u2019s belated\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nMuch of the work of the United Nations since the\ndespicable attacks on the United States of America on\n11 September has been focused on counter-terrorism,\nand this is understandable. The Security Council\u2019s\nadoption of resolution 1373 (2001), obligating\nMembers to implement anti-terrorist measures, should\nrecognize the importance of supporting existing\nregional initiatives in the fight against terrorism. To\nthis end, we welcome the undertakings by the Security\nCouncil Committee on Counter-Terrorism.\nThe World Bank has predicted that the events of\n11 September will exacerbate the already gloomy\nglobal economic outlook. Its ripples will be felt across\nall of the world\u2019s regions, particularly in countries\ndependent on tourism, remittances and foreign\ninvestment. It is thus critical that the Security Council\nallow the competent bodies of the United Nations to\nassess the costs of extending, expanding or adding new\npeacekeeping operations before their implementation.\nNauru joins the international community in\noffering our belated but heartfelt congratulations to\nMr. Kofi Annan and the Organization on being the joint\nrecipients of this year\u2019s prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe former President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, has to be commended for\ncapitalizing on the momentum generated by the\nMillennium Declaration.\nMy delegation is pleased to endorse your\nproposed agenda, Mr. President, for the fifty-sixth\nsession. The work of the General Assembly should be\nrelevant to the tasks at hand, but at the same time it\nshould address long-standing issues affecting the\nefficiency and status of this body. Meaningful\ncooperation between Member States must always be\nencouraged across the boundaries of religion, ethnicity\n2\n\nand culture. The recent World Conference against\nRacism is a stark reminder of how the work of the\nUnited Nations will otherwise continue to be\nfrustrated; but the one significant area where the\nUnited Nations has made little or no progress is on the\nquestion of the reform of the Security Council. We\nwould therefore support a proposal to move the process\nto a higher level and to deal with the complex issues in\na step-by-step fashion.\nThe last meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum\nleaders was held in my country a few months ago. The\ncommuniqu\u00e9 of that meeting has been circulated as a\ndocument of the United Nations. In that communiqu\u00e9\nthe Forum leaders sought to formalize cooperation\narrangements between the United Nations and the\nPacific Islands Forum. I would like to take this\nopportunity to kindly request your support of the\nrelevant draft resolution.\nThe issues of climate change and sea-level rise\ncontinue to be of major concern to my country, and we\nhave repeatedly voiced our deep concern about the\nadverse impact of human-induced climate change,\nespecially on the low-lying atolls around the Pacific.\nWe have stressed the importance of efforts to build\nappropriate human and institutional capacity.\nThe Kyoto Protocol represents a significant step\nforward on the path to taking action to combat climate\nchange, but unless significant action is taken on a\npractical compliance regime, there is little prospect of\nany outcome being enforceable.\nNauru therefore looks forward to participating\nwith the rest of the world in Johannesburg next year to\nreview the progress made since Rio, and it is our\nfervent hope that the Kyoto Protocol will have come\ninto force by then.\nThere is a special urgency for Nauru. Economic\ngrowth in our small country has been negative for more\nthan a decade, and, as reflected in recent revisions of\nour classification by the United Nations and the United\nNations Development Programme, our per capita\nincome has fallen by almost 80 per cent since the\n1980s. We look to the international community, the\nUnited Nations and its various agencies to assist us\nthrough these difficult times and to help secure a safe\nfuture for our children.\nOur region, the world\u2019s very first nuclear-free\nzone, has a long history of supporting disarmament and\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the\nregion\u2019s harsh experience with nuclear testing by\ncolonial Powers. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders\nhave again expressed their desire for the entry into\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nNauru will be depositing its instrument of ratification\ntoday, and I call on other States to follow suit.\nThe trans-shipment of radioactive material and\nMOX fuel, through our exclusive economic zones is a\ncontinuing concern, but we are committed to pursuing\nour concerns constructively and vigorously at the\nappropriate political level.\nNauru\u2019s commitment to the international effort to\ncombat money-laundering is unwavering. Our\nParliament passed anti-money-laundering legislation in\nAugust of this year to correct the deficiencies in our\nregulatory and administrative arrangements. However,\nNauru is disappointed not to have graduated from the\nlist of special non-cooperating countries despite the\nfact that the legislation was drafted in close\ncollaboration with Financial Action Task Force on\nMoney Laundering (FATF) regional representatives.\nWe will nonetheless continue to work on satisfying the\nkey players in FATF on this issue, and we look forward\nto working with our regional partners under the Pacific\nregional action plan being developed.\nNauru, along with 20 other Member States, again\nsupported the inclusion of a resolution on the\nadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan on the\nagenda of the fifty-sixth session. While the attempt\nfailed, Nauru will not be discouraged from continuing\nits efforts to correct this anomaly. We on Nauru\nwholeheartedly believe that the Republic of China on\nTaiwan has a part to play in this Organization, and its\npeople should not be denied a voice in this world body.\nWe note with pleasure the recent admission of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade\nOrganization.\nFinally, I wish to end my statement by revisiting\nthe issue of security and terrorism. It is indeed sad that\nas we meet here today, there is a war going on in the\nworld - a war against terrorism. Prior to the horrific 11\nSeptember attacks on the United States of America, my\nGovernment, at the request of the Government of\nAustralia, agreed to the use of Nauru as a refugee-\nprocessing centre. We made this decision on\nhumanitarian grounds. As a consequence, we now have\non Nauru nearly 800 asylum seekers from Afghanistan,\n3\n\nIraq and Palestine \u2014 10 per cent of the whole\npopulation of Nauru \u2014 along with migration personnel\nfrom the United Nations, the International Organization\nfor Migration and Australia. The asylum seekers are\nnow being processed.\nI have taken it upon myself to personally visit the\ncamps from time to time and to mingle with these\nunfortunate people, and on several occasions have sat\ndown and broken bread with them. I found that they are\nlike you and me. They are brave human beings seeking\na better life for themselves and their children and\nescape from the oppression back home.\nThe resources of the United Nations need to be\naugmented to cope with this humanitarian tragedy, and\nthe international community needs to urgently tackle\nthe problem in a coordinated manner, not only in terms\nof providing assistance and refuge where possible,\nbut also in terms of addressing the sources and causes\nof refugees, people- smuggling and terrorism.\nUnderstanding and responding will not necessarily\nsolve the problem, but it will make it easier for\nGovernments to share in the continuing international\neffort that will be needed.\nFinally, may I say that the good old days, before\n11 September, are gone forever, and I shed a tear. The\nsad part is that we inherited a world that was good\nfrom our forefathers. Today, I ask, do we leave\ntomorrow a better world for our children and our\nchildren\u2019s children? That I ask. Mr. President, we look\nto you for leadership on these vital issues.\nThank you. May God bless those in sorrow. May\nGod bless the United States of America. And may God\nbless the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am\npleased to begin by extending to Mr. Han Seung-soo\nand through him to his friendly country, the Republic\nof Korea, our warmest congratulations on his election\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsixth session. I wish him every success in his tasks\nduring the session. I would also like to convey our\nsincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\nfor the skill and efficiency with which he conducted the\nwork of this Assembly during the past session.\nI am also pleased on behalf of my country to\nrenew our sincere congratulations to Secretary-General\nKofi Annan on his unanimous re-election to continue\nhis noble mission. We congratulate him and the United\nNations on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThis session is taking place at a time when the\nworld is anxious about the consequences of the\natrocious terrorist acts that struck the United States on\n11 September. We have strongly condemned these acts\nand reiterate our condolences to the friendly American\npeople and the families of the victims at this difficult\ntime. States were unanimous in the recently adopted\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions in\nemphasizing the need to combat terrorism with all\ndetermination in order to uproot and prevent this\nscourge.\nSince the early 1990s, Tunisia has warned against\nthe dangers of terrorism. It has called for adopting the\nnecessary measures at the national, regional and\ninternational levels to fight this phenomenon with all\navailable means. Today, we reiterate our earlier\nstatements. It is important to develop cooperation\namong States to fight terrorism, by taking all necessary\nand strong measures to implement Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). This should apply to those who\nabet directly or indirectly or are involved in\nperpetrating terrorist acts in their countries of origin or\nelsewhere. All acts of terrorism must be condemned\nwithout double standards, particularly with respect to\nthe granting of political asylum or residency. Tunisia's\nbelief in the necessity of adopting such measures has\nspared it the presence of extremist elements and\nterrorism on its territory.\nIf we are to develop international cooperation in\nthis field, we will need to enhance approved legal\n36\n\nnorms. This can be done through a comprehensive\ninternational treaty allowing for a comprehensive plan\nof action. In the same vein, Tunisia supports the\nconvening of an international conference against\nterrorism. The conference would identify the legal\nframework and machinery needed to protect the\ninternational community from the dangers of this\nscourge.\nIn Tunisia's view, the struggle against and\neventual elimination of terrorism requires the adoption\nof a comprehensive approach that makes prevention\nand the identification of the root causes of this\nphenomenon the bases of the methodology of\ninternational efforts. It is also necessary to consider the\ninternational circumstances that influence and promote\nthe increase in terrorism. This will allow us to find the\nappropriate approach to ending the spread of this\nphenomenon and its existence. In this context, it is\nimperative that we address all aspects that lead to\nfeelings of injustice, the absence of justice, deprivation\nand marginalization. This will prevent suspicious\nparties from exploiting these feelings to fuel extremism\nand terrorism. There is no doubt that the United\nNations and the General Assembly in particular have\nan effective role to play in clarifying that vision.\nAny comprehensive approach to fighting\nterrorism must stress the interdependence and\ninteraction between stability, security and peace, on the\none hand, and development and progress on the other.\nThe Millennium Summit, which brought together\nthe most important assembly of heads of State and\nGovernment in the history of our Organization and\nprovided a unique opportunity to discuss the state of\ninternational affairs in all its aspects, stressed that\nlinkage. It highlighted the need to formulate an\ninternational strategy and operational plans to achieve\nthe unanimously agreed objectives specified by the\nleaders for the next millennium.\nThis session is thus especially important in that it\nprovides an opportunity, a year later, to take stock of\nthe principles and objectives approved at the\nMillennium Summit. It also permits us to develop\nconcerted action based on these principles and\nobjectives. These include a common, cooperative and\nconsensual approach to the problems of our world, be\nthey issues of international peace and security or of\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty.\nSolidarity, then, is imperative in the light of the\nmany challenges faced by mankind. In this context,\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia has\nstressed before several regional forums, including the\nMillennium Summit and the Security Council summit,\nthe importance of solidarity in dealing with poverty,\nwhich is one source of tension and crises in societies.\nWe believe that we cannot guarantee stability and\nsecurity in the world without eliminating all forms of\npoverty, marginalization and alienation. In this context,\nPresident Ben Ali launched his appeal to establish a\nworld fund for solidarity towards the eradication of\npoverty.\nFrom this rostrum, I extend my sincere thanks to\nall parties that responded to this proposal and\nparticipated in the consultations held by the Secretary-\nGeneral. In this regard, I cannot fail to commend the\nefforts of the Secretary-General to prepare a positive\nreport, which we hope will be the basis for establishing\nthe fund at this session. We have repeatedly affirmed\nthat the fund will not duplicate existing United Nations\nbodies concerned with fighting poverty; it will, instead,\ncomplement their efforts and provide a means of\nfinancing through voluntary contributions by\nindividuals, institutions or societies, in addition to\nGovernments. These contributions will be deposited in\nan account to be administered by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme.\nThere is no doubt that the strengthening of the\nfoundations of international peace and security is a task\nentrusted primarily to the Security Council, which in\nrecent weeks has proved particularly effective in its\nreaction to current developments. We hope that that\nimportant body will maintain the same effectiveness in\nseeking solutions to all international problems.\nFrom this perspective, developments in the\nMiddle East must take priority among the issues before\nthe Council. This is particularly important in view of\nthe continuing instability in the region caused by\nIsrael's intransigence. We call on the Security Council,\nand especially its permanent members, to play an\neffective role so as to spare the Middle East from the\nspectre of an endless conflict, by urging Israel to take\nurgent measures to ensure the protection of the\nPalestinian people. Tunisia reaffirms its initiative,\ncalling for the protection of the Palestinian people\nthrough the deployment of international forces in the\nregion.\n37\n\nWe believe that the only viable option in the\nMiddle East today is a just, lasting and comprehensive\npeace that guarantees for the Palestinians the return of\ntheir land and their legitimate rights, foremost of which\nis their right to establish an independent State. In this\ncontext, Tunisia welcomes President Bush's\naffirmation before the General Assembly of the\nnecessity of establishing a Palestinian State. We also\nreiterate our position on the need for Israeli forces to\nleave Syrian and Lebanese territory.\nThe question of sanctions prompts us to examine\nour consciences in the light of the suffering it causes\ncivilians. We hope that there will be international\nconsensus to remove the sanctions against Iraq and to\ndeal with the humanitarian issue of missing Kuwaitis\nand persons from third countries. It is also time once\nand for all to lift the sanctions imposed against our\nsister country Libya, which has implemented all its\nobligations concerning the Lockerbie incident.\nAs a member of the region, Tunisia is working\ntowards more active participation in the Maghreb\nUnion, which aspires to integrate the States of the\nregion by enhancing the structure of the Union and\nguiding its work, given its function as a strategic\noption that reflects the will of the people of the region.\nTunisia is working to promote consultation and\ncooperation in the European-Mediterranean space on\nthe basis of equality, mutual respect, protection of the\ninterests of all parties and respect for their\nparticularities. The aim is to bring about the solid\ndevelopment of the peoples of the two shores of the\nMediterranean so as to achieve greater security and\nstability in the region.\nFaithful to its commitment to the African\ncontinent, Tunisia supports new initiatives for Africa\nand has joined the newly created African Union and\nwill support it with all our capabilities and experience.\nRespect for the purposes and principles of the\nCharter only strengthens the action of the Organization\nin responding to the challenges of development and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\ncontext, we have to strengthen the role of the General\nAssembly, as an expression of the collective will of its\nMembers and as an embodiment of the concept of\ndemocracy in international relations.\nWith regard to the activities of the Security\nCouncil, Tunisia, throughout its term of office in the\nCouncil, has tried to strengthen the role of this organ\nby advocating consensus in dealing with the various\nitems on its agenda. This, in our view, will enhance the\nCouncil's credibility and will reflect positively on its\nefficiency.\nDuring its presidency of the Council in February\n2001, Tunisia adopted a new comprehensive approach\nto dealing with various cases of instability and crises in\nthe world.\nTunisia put forward a proposal for holding a\ndebate on the subject Peace-building: towards a\ncomprehensive approach. The result of this debate\nwas a unanimous affirmation by members of the\nCouncil of the close connection between peace and\ndevelopment, of the preventive dimension of this\napproach and of the importance of solidarity in the\ninternational community when it comes to taking\nmeasures that are necessary for helping countries that\nare racked by tension and conflict.\nWithin this context, I must stress the need for the\nreform of the Security Council so as to expand its\nmembership of permanent and non-permanent seats on\nthe basis of equitable geographic distribution that will\nguarantee the interests of all countries, particularly the\ndeveloping countries. In contributing operationally to\nthe establishment of peace and security in the world,\nTunisia has participated in a number of peacekeeping\noperations such as its current participation in the\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) headed\nby a Tunisian ambassador representing the United\nNations.\nThe elimination of weapons of mass destruction\nrepresents one of the major challenges facing\nhumanity. The importance of the establishment of\nzones free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly\nin the Middle East, is to be stressed in this context.\nTechnological and scientific advances have\ndwarfed distances and enabled mankind to score major\nachievements in numerous fields, such as spread of\nideas and bringing people closer to each other.\nDevelopment, however, has not benefited all peoples,\nparticularly developing countries. The widening of the\nquantitative gap between industrialized and developing\ncountries is a matter of concern. Concrete measures\nmust be taken to permit all countries to benefit from\nthe technological and information revolution. From this\nstandpoint, we would express the importance that\nTunisia places, since the International\n38\n\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) Conference in\nMinneapolis, on hosting the second phase of the World\nSummit on the Information Society in Tunisia in 2005.\nWe would like to express our gratitude to all countries\nthat have supported us in this. We would also like to\nexpress our thanks to Mr. Yoshio Utsumi, ITU\nSecretary-General, for his constructive role.\nWe hope that the General Assembly will adopt at\nthis session a resolution to begin preparations for this\nconference in its two phases. We also hope that the\nwork of this conference will lead to the establishment\nof a true and effective world information partnership\nbetween developed and developing countries.\nOur ability to meet challenges, which we are all\nfacing, including the fight against terrorism, depends\non our willingness to channel our efforts towards joint\naction, based on cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and\npartnership within the framework of our Organization,\nwhich is the ideal place for the realization of our\naspirations and for the benefit of all mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\nmust reinforce these efforts and focus our work.\nFor more than half a century, the United Nations\nhas worked to promote human rights and economic and\nsocial development. We must continue to invest in\nhuman dignity.\nFor more than half a century, the United Nations\nhas given millions of people hope for a better future.\nSuch hope has never been more important than it is\ntoday.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize could not have been\nawarded to more deserving candidates than Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Let me\nonce again extend my heartfelt congratulations.\n15\n\nThe terrorist attacks on 11 September were not\nonly directed at innocent people. They were directed at\nthe very values on which the United Nations is based.\nWe stand united in our condemnation of these\nattacks, in our call for international cooperation to\nprevent and eradicate terrorism and to bring the guilty\nto justice. We will fight terrorism by all appropriate\nmeans: political, diplomatic, legal, financial and\nmilitary.\nNorway pledges its full support to the broad\nglobal coalition against terrorism. We are part of the\nAtlantic Alliance. We fully support the United States in\ndefending itself against international terrorism. We are\nimplementing the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) by taking concrete steps to dry\nup the financial resources of terrorist networks.\nThe Taliban regime has refused to adhere to\nmandatory Security Council decisions. It is harbouring\nand supporting terrorists, in blunt contravention of\nCouncil resolutions. The Taliban are refusing to\ncooperate with the international community in our\ncommon efforts to eradicate international terrorism.\nThe use of military force is therefore the only option\nleft.\nThe military operations in Afghanistan are aimed\nat the terrorists and those who harbour them. They are\nnot aimed at innocent civilians or at Afghanistan as a\ncountry. They are aimed at a group of extremists who\nare exploiting a world religion for their own evil\npurposes.\nAfghanistan has suffered misrule and war for\ndecades. While the immediate task is to end terrorism\nand provide humanitarian support to those in need, we\nmust work in parallel for a political solution. This is\nprimarily the responsibility of the Afghan people\nthemselves, but the international community must\nassist. The United Nations must have a leading role.\nPlanning and preparations must start now. We strongly\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General\u2019s Special\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to\nhelp lay the foundation for a broad-based and lasting\npolitical solution.\nWe must ensure that the Afghans receive\nhumanitarian assistance both inside Afghanistan and in\nneighbouring countries. But while seeking to meet\nimmediate needs, we must also focus on the longer-\nterm assistance that will be necessary to rebuild this\nwar-torn society. We must improve respect for human\nrights and help the Afghan people, in particular\nwomen, who have suffered so terribly under Taliban\nrule. These are issues that Norway will focus on during\nits chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group\nnext year. Only through coordinated efforts can we\ncontribute to security and development in Afghanistan.\nA year ago, peace between the Israelis and the\nPalestinians appeared to be at hand. Today, the hope for\npeace and security has given way to disillusion, despair\nand the murder of civilians.\nWe are convinced that the only way out of the\ncurrent stalemate is through the full implementation of\nthe recommendations in the Mitchell report, which\nhave been endorsed by both parties and by the\ninternational community.\nFirst of all, there must be an immediate end to the\nviolence. Terrorism must be stopped. The cycle of\nviolent action and reaction must be broken. Political\nleaders on both sides must do everything in their power\nto halt the violence and reduce the tension.\nSecondly, confidence-building measures must be\nimplemented simultaneously. Trust must be rebuilt step\nby step, since without it there can be no real dialogue\nor negotiation. The Mitchell report lists several steps\nfor restoring trust. Given the high level of hostility and\nmistrust, the timing and sequence of these steps are\ncrucial. Decisions must be made now.\nThirdly, the parties must find a way back to the\nnegotiating table. A halt to the violence, the resumption\nof security cooperation and steps to restore trust cannot\nbe sustained for long without serious negotiations to\nresolve the underlying causes of the conflict.\nNorway will continue to support efforts to bring\nabout a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As Chair of\nthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, we stand ready to\nwork with other donors to help restore the economic\nand social infrastructure in the Palestinian areas.\nThe bulk of the conflicts dealt with by the\nSecurity Council are found on the African continent.\nAs a member of the Security Council, Norway is\ndetermined to do what it can to promote long-term\npeace and stability in Africa. Most of the conflicts in\nAfrica clearly demonstrate the close links between\npeace, good governance and development. The root\ncauses of many of these conflicts are poverty and lack\n16\n\nof development, but also violations of human rights\nand disrespect for basic democratic principles.\nNorway stands ready to assist in building a sound\nfoundation for good governance and development in\nAfrica. The developments in Burundi are encouraging,\nalthough we recognize that the peace process is still\nvery fragile. The deployment of a multinational\nsecurity force, on the initiative of South Africa, will,\nhopefully, improve the situation in Burundi. Norway is\nready to support this initiative.\nThe United Nations is our foremost tool for\nsolving global problems. We should recall that\ncombating terrorism has not removed any of the\nchallenges that were on the global agenda prior to\n11 September. Nor has it become less pressing to\neffectively address these challenges. We must not let\nthe cruelty of terrorists divert attention from the\nambitious goals we set for ourselves during the\nMillennium Summit.\nMeeting those objectives must remain right at the\ntop of our agenda, along with our common fight against\nterrorism. If the United Nations is to be effective in\npursuing these tasks, we must all commit ourselves and\nprovide the necessary resources and financial support.\nAs political leaders, we must show steadfast\ndetermination. We will have to make difficult choices\nand hard decisions, sometimes with painful\nconsequences. But the alternative is even more pain\nand suffering.\nThis is true in our common fight against\ninternational terrorism. This is true in our struggle to\nend poverty, eliminate infectious diseases and uphold\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law. This is\ntrue if we are to make the United Nations our primary\ntool for safeguarding our common security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Let me\nassure the President of the full support of my\ndelegation in the discharge of his most important\nfunctions.\nThe twenty-first century will forever be\nremembered for the fiery hell that engulfed the world\non that dark day of a cloudless sky on 11 September.\nThe horrific images of passenger aircraft flying to their\ndoom to cause great death, grief and despair to\ncountless people will always be a scar on our\nindividual and collective memory. Surely, failure to\nbring to justice those guilty of that crime, and those\nwho follow the same path, would mean our collective\nsubmission to an endless reign of terror and to fearful\ndarkness.\nIt is the wish of the Government and the people\nof Bhutan that I should, once again, express our\nsolidarity with the Government and the people of the\nUnited States and convey our heartfelt sympathy to\nthose who have suffered the irreparable loss of their\nloved and dear ones. We admire the way in which the\npeople of this great nation have come together to rise to\nthe challenges that the tragic events have left in their\nwake. We pay tribute to the brave and the selfless who\nlaid down their own lives as they fought to save those\nof others. Our hearts and minds are with the city of\nNew York, which has not only been a gracious host to\nthe United Nations, but is unparalleled in its generosity\nin giving shelter, livelihood, hope and joy to people of\nall races and creeds. Indeed, it came as no surprise that\nthe scale of the tragedy made itself felt not only in the\ndevastatingly high number of victims, but in the fact\nthat people from more than 80 countries were counted\namong the dead.\nA small part of everyone died that day, for\nreasons that can never be explained or justified. Indeed,\nhuman society has been left to ponder its claim to\nbeing civilized.\nUntil the tragedy of 11 September, the threat of\nterrorism was not fully appreciated. Those who had not\nfelt its demonic wrath tolerated it as just another\nmanifestation of social or political discontent. The\ncurrent environment throughout the globalized world\nhas harshly and most cruelly removed such\nmisconceptions. People all over the world are losing\ntheir freedom, willingly or without choice, in a\nmultitude of ways. And there is a pervasive sense of\nfear. Freedom is a heavy price to pay for anything.\nCivilized society ought to provide more liberty, not be\ncowed into affording less.\nThe disease that is the cause must be stamped out.\nA determined and coordinated approach by all\ncountries is the indispensable key. To this end, the\nUnited Nations must play the central role. It must\ninspire, unite and act. It must be behind all individual\ncountry, group and global efforts. In this context, the\nimportant initiative taken by the Security Council in\nresolution 1373 (2001) is to be welcomed. However,\nwe must remember that its impact will be determined\nnot so much by the letter as by the spirit with which it\nis accepted and implemented by all Member States.\nFor its part, Bhutan will make every effort to\nfulfil its duty as a Member State and a nation that is\nfully committed to the eradication of terrorism. Today,\nI signed the International Convention for the\n32\n\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and in due\ncourse our legislature will clear the way for accession\nto the other conventions relating to international\nterrorism.\nThe reign of terrorists in Afghanistan is coming\nto an end. It is our hope that the healing of the deep\nand painful wounds suffered interminably by the\nhelpless and innocent victims will begin immediately.\nWe also hope that, in the coming years, they will be\nable to find the environment of peace and security that\nhas eluded them for too long. Unfortunately, the period\nof renewal and reconstruction at the individual,\ncommunity and national levels will be long and\narduous for a country that has been reduced to rubble\nby war and its ravaging companions. We appeal to the\ninternational community to give sustained support to\nAfghanistan in a way that is sympathetic and\nresponsive to its immediate and long-term needs, while\nrespecting fully the dignity of its proud people.\nEven as we call for sustained and adequate\nassistance to Afghanistan, we must acknowledge that\nthe world is still reeling from the aftershocks of the\nattacks of 11 September. The cumulative impact on a\nworld economy that was already following a downward\ntrend has yet to be seen. There are other disturbing\nuncertainties. Clearly, there is a need to better define\nand understand the scope and limits of the war on\nterrorism so that the fears of the broader clash that is\nbeing spoken of are calmed. How do we create a\nclimate that can prevent the further diversion of\nresources to defence? Will the onslaught be protracted\nand consumptive in terms of our combined energy and\nresources? Amid such doubts and concerns, it is natural\nthat we should worry about how the international\ncommunity might be able to deliver on the hopes that\nwere raised by the Millennium Declaration a year ago.\nOur capacity to fight HIV/AIDS and poverty becomes\nquestionable, especially within the time frame we have\nset for ourselves.\nAgainst such a backdrop, the growing challenge\nwill be how to share and give in difficult times. How\ndoes one give beyond the bounds of disposable\nsurplus? As the representative of a developing country,\nI say this without wishing to undermine the greater\nimportance of raising domestic revenues and devoting\nthem to meeting the targets set. In this context, the\ndefining moment will be offered at the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Mexico.\nNow more than ever it is necessary to reform the\nSecurity Council. We cannot continue to procrastinate\non this vital issue. The Council has to be a truly\nrepresentative body if it is to be relevant, respected and\neffective. That is not possible when vast continents and\nsignificant populations in the world are left out of\ncrucial decision-making processes on international\npeace and security. Without fair representation, the\nCouncil will risk emasculation \u2014 faltering on making\ndecisions that are implemented feebly.\nThe serious humanitarian, political and economic\nconsequences of the terrorist acts demand unity of\nthought and action on the part of all nations. Terrorism\nmust be rooted out. Yet, as in the conduct of our\neveryday life, there is a need for balance and\nmoderation. Just as the reasons for soul-searching and\ndoubt in ourselves as civilized beings are compelling, it\nis my earnest hope that the success of this session will\nbe marked by the profundity of collective wisdom and\ncommitment to restore lasting security, peace and\nnormality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\nyear's session of the General Assembly is marked by\nprofound sadness over the innocent victims of the\nmacabre acts perpetrated by terrorists two months ago\nhere in the United States of America, and now also by\nthe events of this morning. On behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of Albania, I would like to\nexpress our utter indignation and our strongest and\ncategorical condemnation of those acts, which were\naimed not at a single country but, rather, were a serious\nattack on the values of democracy, freedom and world\ncivilization. At the same time, I would like to convey\nour deepest sympathy to the American people and to all\nthe families that lost loved ones in those tragic events.\nInternational terrorism is today becoming one of\nthe greatest challenges for the world in which we live.\nIt is essential that the international community tackle\nthis phenomenon with the greatest seriousness, for it is\nreplete with catastrophic consequences in many areas.\nAlbania considers the military actions of the anti-\nterrorism coalition led by the United States and Great\nBritain against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and\nthe Al Qaeda terrorist group, under the leadership of\nbin Laden, to be just and in full conformity with\nChapter VII of the Charter and Security Council\nresolutions. Taking that into account, and as a country\nthat defends the values of liberty and democracy,\nAlbania expressed its determination to be part of that\ncoalition from the outset.\nThe international action that has just begun\nagainst terrorism should not be seen as a clash between\ncivilizations. On the contrary, we Albanians see it as a\nstruggle between good and evil and as a confrontation\nin which the values of humanism and peace are set\nagainst obscurantism and the negation of values. The\nonly way to win this war is for all of our countries to\nunite their forces to create a common front, to take\nincreasingly Draconian preventive measures at the\nnational level, and to deploy ways and means for\ncooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels to\nblock any individual terrorist or terrorist group that\nthreatens international peace and security. For its part,\nwith the mechanisms at its disposal, the United Nations\ncould and should do more to coordinate those efforts.\nAlbania welcomes the measures taken by the\nUnited Nations to respond to acts of terrorism. We\nstrongly support Security Council resolution 1373\n2\n\n(2001) and call on all Member States to fulfil their\nobligations under the resolution. We also support the\ncurrent efforts aimed at completing the United Nations\nlegal framework for coordination and for the\ninternational community's efforts to combat terrorism.\nFor its part, Albania is already a party to eight major\ninternational conventions on the struggle against\nterrorism. We shall soon adhere to six more\nconventions.\nThe new Albanian Government's four-year\nprogramme has set very clear objectives to definitively\ntake the country out of its long transition stage and\nplace it on the path towards stable economic\ndevelopment, the consolidation of its democratic\ninstitutions and legal framework, and integration into\nthe European family. Thanks to sustained efforts,\nAlbania has already established an encouraging climate\nfor individual Albanian entrepreneurship as well as for\nforeign investment.\nMoreover, Albanian institutions will keep the\nstruggle against terrorism, organized crime, illegal\ntrafficking and corruption at the centre of their\nactivities. The responsible commitment of the country's\nleaders to an uncompromising struggle against those\nphenomena, as well as their cooperation with other\ncountries in the region and beyond, has in most cases\nkept in check the activities of criminal elements who\nseek to exploit Albania as a transit country for various\ntypes of illegal trafficking.\nAlbania believes that a mosaic of fledging\ndemocracies is already taking shape in the Balkans,\nalbeit with difficulties. Believing that domestic\npolitical and economic stability are intrinsically linked\nto regional stability, Albania has committed itself to\napplying a regional policy of good-neighbourliness\ntowards all Balkan countries, and has already given\nconcrete proof of that desire. One clear sign of that\npolicy was the re-establishment of diplomatic relations\nwith the Belgrade Government at the beginning of the\nyear. That was a logical follow-up to the democratic\ndevelopments begun in the Republic of Serbia that led\nto results that were eagerly awaited by the whole of the\ninternational community, namely, the fall of the\nMilosevi\u0107 regime and his dispatch to the Tribunal at\nThe Hague. The same fate should also befall the other\ncriminals who carried out the policy of genocide and\nethnic cleansing he planned.\nOn behalf of peace and stability in the region, as\nwell as on behalf of good-neighbourliness, Albania has\nadopted a realistic attitude, even with regard to the\nmost recent crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia. The position we adopted was very much\nappreciated by the international community.\nThe Albanian Government welcomed the Ochrid\nframework Agreement between the Macedonian\nauthorities and the Albanian political forces, and we\nhope that it will soon be implemented in a\ncomprehensive manner, as this would contribute to\npeace and stability in Macedonia and in the region. We\nalso warmly welcome the indispensable role of, and the\nefforts made by, international mediators, which led to\nthe signing of the Agreement, as well as the\ncommitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) and the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) to ensure its\nimplementation on the ground.\nThe Albanian State has good relations of\ncooperation with Kosovo, and we greatly appreciate the\npositive developments that have taken place there. The\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\nKosovo, and Mr. Haekkerup personally, have taken a\nnumber of very important steps in order to finalize the\nlegal framework for Kosovo and to organize the\ngeneral elections, which will be held on 17 November.\nThe elections will represent an important chapter\nin the history of Kosovo and of the region, because this\nwill be the first time in their history that the people of\nKosovo will be electing, in a free and democratic\nmanner, democratic Government bodies that will take\ncharge of the future of Kosovo. We would like to\nexpress our sincere hope that the Serb minority and the\nother minorities living in Kosovo will participate in\nthese elections, because we consider them to be an\nintegral part of Kosovar society.\nAlthough I do not wish to speak at great length\nabout the many problems that are facing Kosovo, I\nwould simply like to appeal to the international\ncommunity to actively seek a solution to the issue of\ndivided Mitrovica. Practices aimed at averting inter-\nethnic conflict in Kosovo such as compromises in the\narea of territorial compensation based on the concept of\nparcelling out its territory, and the establishment of\nparallel institutions, are harmful and should be\n3\n\ndeplored. They will not benefit Kosovo. They will\nsimply give rise to a fresh surge of the inter-ethnic\nhatred that was fuelled by Milosevic. The international\ncommunity and the active political forces in Kosovo\nmust make every effort to build a new and open society\nthat respects ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.\nAlbania has established good relations of\ncooperation with the countries in the region, both\nbilaterally and multilaterally. It has endeavoured to\nplay its part in contributing to peace and stability in the\nBalkans, including through the framework of the\nSoutheast Europe Cooperation Process, whose\nchairmanship Albania currently holds. In the\nframework of this initiative, Albania will play an even\nmore active role in coordinating the efforts of member\nStates with a view to strengthening multilateral\ncooperation in all areas, in order to overcome the crises\nand problems of the region.\nThe Albanian Government will continue with this\ncommitment over the next four years. It will work also\nwithin the framework of other regional initiatives,\nwhere one of our important commitments is to\nimplement joint infrastructure projects in the\nframework of the Stability Pact for South-eastern\nEurope.\nLike the other countries of the region, Albania\nhas embraced with enthusiasm the process of\nintegration into Euro-Atlantic bodies, as its strategic\nobjective and principal priority is to become a member\nof the European Union.\nThe Albanian Government welcomed the decision\ntaken last June by the G\u02c6teborg Summit to begin in the\nnear future the process of negotiations for the signing\nof a stabilization and association agreement. The\nAlbanian Government hopes that these negotiations\nwill be concluded as soon as possible and that the\nagreement will be signed within the next year. We are\naware that this will require coordination and\ncooperation at all Government levels in order for us to\nbe able to meet the political, economic, social and\nother standards emanating from this process.\nWe are convinced that integration has to start at\nhome and that we will have to do more to achieve the\nresults required by the European Union in all areas,\nparticularly when it comes to progress in effecting\nreform, and especially in terms of consolidating our\nlegal system, harmonizing our legislation with the\nexisting body of community agreements, and the\ncarrying out of effective macro- and micro-economic\npolicies.\nJoining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) is one of Albania's strategic objectives.\nThanks to its close relationship with the Euro-Atlantic\nAlliance in the last few years, it is one of the nine\ncountries that the Alliance has designated as being\npotential candidates for NATO membership.\nToday humanity is facing both new and old\nthreats. Conflicts between States; inter-ethnic conflicts;\nterrorism and organized crime; widespread poverty and\nthe wide gap that exists between the poor and the rich\ncountries, including the digital divide; natural disasters\nand the drying up of energy resources; diseases such as\nAIDS and other epidemic illnesses, and those spread by\nbioterrorism, have long been the subject of study in the\ninternational community. Current developments\nthroughout the world have shown, now more than ever,\nthe vital importance and the crucial role of the United\nNations in achieving peace and security and in\nfostering development throughout the world.\nThe Millennium Summit showed yet again that it\nis essential for each State Member of our Organization\nto maintain an ongoing commitment to contribute to\nresolving regional and international conflicts and\ntensions and to address such challenges as\nglobalization, poverty, HIV/AIDS, drugs, and the\nachievement of sustainable development.\nBut beyond these challenges, the United Nations\nis facing a multitude of problems related to its reform.\nIt must manage its resources even better so that they\ncan be used as much as possible for peacekeeping and\nfor development projects in all of the poor countries,\nthe countries in transition and the developing countries.\nThe United Nations should also become as\nrepresentative a body as possible.\nFinally, the United Nations must devise and\nimplement wholeheartedly mechanisms that are not\nbureaucratic or complex but streamlined and effective,\nin order to ensure that its activities become more\nconcrete and bear more fruit and that its voice carries\nthe highest authority throughout the world.\n\n"

I wish to convey the\ngreetings and warm wishes of His Majesty, Her\nMajesty The Queen Mother, Ndlovukazi, the\nGovernment and the entire Swazi nation to all our\nfriends and fellow Members of the United Nations.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland offers her warmest\ncongratulations to the President on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. We are confident that with his proven abilities\nand leadership, he will guide us to success in our\ndeliberations at this time of crisis in global affairs.\nAllow me to express our appreciation to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri, of\nFinland, who, by his astute and judicious leadership,\nbrought to a successful conclusion the work of the\nfifty-fifth session.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would further like to\ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\nleading our Organization so effectively through his\ntenure thus far. We will continue to depend on his\nhighly developed sense of diplomacy and his\nundoubted commitment to achieve global peace,\nstability and equitable development. The recent award\nof the Nobel Peace Prize to both the Secretary-General\nand the United Nations attests to the aforementioned\nattributes.\nWe are also grateful for the continuing dedication\nand hard work of the staff of the United Nations, whose\nefforts are needed all the more in these challenging\ntimes. In this regard, we call upon all our fellow\nMembers to demonstrate their support for the\nSecretary-General and his staff by honouring their\nfinancial obligations, so that our Organization can have\nsufficient resources with which to meet the widening\nscope of its activities.\nWe are meeting one year after the historic\ngathering of world leaders, when the international\ncommunity sought to redefine and articulate a common\nvision for the future of all its citizens. The goals to be\nachieved were clearly set out in the Millennium\nDeclaration as an outcome of the Millennium Summit.\nToday we have the opportunity \u2014 indeed, the\nresponsibility \u2014 to evaluate just how far we have come\nin that mission which we set for ourselves through this\nOrganization. We need to address honestly our\nshortcomings in commitment and action and to further\ndevise practical and realistic strategies that will result\nin measurable progress in areas identified for urgent\naction.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore believes\nthat the promotion of sustainable international peace\nand security must be one of the main priorities of the\nUnited Nations, because it is clear that our collective\naim of raising the living standard of our peoples is\n36\n\npossible only in conditions of global stability and with\nnations living harmoniously alongside one another.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of the\nworld in condemnation of the tragic terrorist attacks of\n11 September, to which the international community\nmust respond because such acts are an assault on\nhuman decency and humanity. These acts cannot be\njustified under any circumstances. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland repudiates such acts and aligns itself with all\npeace-loving people around the world not only in\ncondemning such acts, but also in calling for their\ncomplete eradication. To that end, the Kingdom of\nSwaziland will do all in its power to prevent acts of\nterrorism and to ensure that the support and financing\nof terrorism cannot take root on Swazi soil. We once\nmore offer our sympathy and prayers to the families\nand friends of those who lost their lives in the tragedy.\nFuture global stability is threatened by the spread\nof weapons of mass destruction, as well as the\nunabated proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons. Vigorous and urgent efforts are needed to\neliminate these weapons. In this regard, we welcome\nthe successful conclusion of the United Nations\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as of\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We\ndeem their outcomes timely and necessary.\nWhile much has been done through the process of\nreform effected by the Secretary-General, it is also\nrecognized that there has been very little progress made\nso far by the Open-ended Working Group to address\nthe most important aspect of the reform: the\nrestructuring of the Security Council. More intensified\nefforts should be made to bring to a conclusion the\ndeliberations on this issue, and we look forward to the\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly in\nadvancing negotiations towards a lasting solution. The\nKingdom of Swaziland is still committed to the process\nof the reform for the expansion of the Security Council\nin both categories of its membership. In that regard, we\ncontinue to support the African position in favour of\ntwo permanent seats and three non-permanent seats\nbeing allocated to the African continent.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\nUnited Nations, in conjunction with regional\norganizations, must take on a more proactive role in\npreventive diplomacy to head off potentially explosive\nsituations. We need an effective early warning\ncapability to deal with emerging conflicts and much\ncloser collaboration between the Security Council and\nthe Office of the Secretary-General in our efforts to\nmeet security challenges wherever they may occur.\nAt this time, our Organization is understandably\nfocused on global security. The crisis in the peace\nprocess between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is\na component of the overall challenge and continues to\npose a significant threat to security in both the Middle\nEast and the wider world at large. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland believes that the only solution to the\ncontinuing instability in that region is through peaceful\ndialogue and a return to the spirit of compromise and\nunderstanding that has characterized the relationship\nbetween the two sides in the past. We commend the\nefforts of all who are trying to bring lasting,\nsustainable peace to the Middle East, and we offer our\nencouragement and support for the achievement of this\ngoal.\nOn the African continent, security challenges\ncontinue to cause suffering and restrict the\ndevelopment of many millions of our people. While\nthis is undeniable, it is also clear that Africa itself is\ntaking on the responsibility to find solutions to the\ncrises affecting a number of its nations. The peace\nprocesses in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea and Angola\nall have benefited from the involvement of our regional\nand subregional groupings and from the efforts of\ndedicated African men and women. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland supports unequivocally these efforts, and we\njoin our fellow African Member States in calling for\ncontinued and enhanced support from the United\nNations and individual countries and for commitments\nin word to be followed up by action.\nIn developmental terms, there is a new wind\nblowing through all the African countries, bringing\nfresh hope to our peoples for improved standards of\nliving and the removal of the burdens of the past. A\nseries of historic agreements by all African countries\nindicates a new era of optimism for the continent, as\nwell as the start of a new relationship with the rest of\nthe world. The continent will no longer tolerate the\nnotion of unconstitutional Governments, and we have\nall confirmed our belief that transparency and\naccountability are the watchwords of governance that\nplaces people at the centre of development.\n37\n\nWe also believe that trade with the rest of the\nworld is the lifeblood of our developing economies,\nencouraging the creation of businesses and inward and\nlocal investment and increasing employment. We\ntherefore commend those countries and trading blocs\nthat recognize the importance to Africa of freeing up\ntheir markets for our goods and services and encourage\nothers to follow suit.\nThe birth of the African Union is a signal to the\nrest of the world that Africa means business and is\nready to back up its words with action. The New\nAfrican Initiative proposes a partnership that is based\non support for an Africa that recognizes and accepts its\nresponsibilities from a world that understands our\npriorities for development. We commend the initiative\nto those who are in a position to help Africa emerge\nfrom the disappointments of the past into a prosperous\nand secure future.\nWe are on the edge of a global recession, and its\neffects will be felt hardest among those of us in the\ndeveloping world. After a decade of encouraging talk\nof the benefits of globalization, we are discovering the\nhard truth: that we are nowhere near the stage of being\nable to gain advantage from a world of liberalized\ntrade. This must now surely be plain for anyone to see.\nGlobalization in its unfettered form is likely to do\nmore harm than good to the small, vulnerable\neconomies unless measures are put in place to protect\nthem in the short to medium term. There must be\nagreed ground rules to regulate the conduct of free\ntrade in goods and services to ensure an equitable\nexchange between unequal partners.\nConsidering the intrinsic link between peace,\nsecurity and development, the United Nations has an\neven bigger responsibility to increase its efforts to\nsecure resources to finance development, especially for\nthose of us most at risk in these times of economic\nuncertainty. We believe it is the responsibility of the\nwider international community to continue to provide\nresources to assist developing countries to fight their\nway out of poverty.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\nconfidently and peacefully, according to the wishes of\nits people. Our review of the Constitution was\ncompleted earlier this year, and the recommendations\nof the people will now be drafted into a legal document\nfor final approval by the Swazi nation next year. This\nvital nation-building process will result in a\nConstitution that is based entirely on the wishes of the\npeople themselves, and we are confident that it will\nserve the best interests of the Kingdom for many\ngenerations to come.\nPoverty alleviation remains the top priority for\nthe Kingdom, and we continue to make great efforts to\nachieve this aim through a series of economic\nmeasures, such as investment attraction, increased\ntrade and the stimulation of local entrepreneurship. We\nare embarking on an ambitious programme to\nmaximize the potential of our tourism and industry\nsectors, and in this we need the support of the\ninternational financial institutions, as well as the\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\nDespite our best efforts, and in common with all\ndeveloping countries, the Kingdom is finding progress\ndifficult to achieve in the face of huge obstacles, with\nthe greatest undoubtedly being the threat to our future\nposed by the HIV/AIDS crisis. During the United\nNations special session on HIV/AIDS held here in\nJune, we made clear the scale of the disaster facing our\nnation. There is no doubt that the spread of HIV among\nthe population represents our greatest development\nchallenge, and we are working hard in a combined,\nnational effort to overcome the devastating effects of\nthe pandemic.\nHowever, we cannot do this alone. We need\nsubstantial support to implement our strategy of\neducation, prevention, care and counselling. Finances,\ndrugs, expertise and guidance are all urgently required.\nThe very survival of our nation is at stake, and we\nappeal once more to the United Nations and to the\ninternational community at large not to abandon us at\nthis moment of supreme necessity.\nIt could be said that there has been an\ninauspicious start to the twenty-first century, with the\nglobalization of terrorism and the reality of a global\neconomic recession at the forefront of our minds. This\nplaces all the more responsibility on the United Nations\nto harness the resources and commitment of the\ncitizens of the world for the benefit of humankind. In\nthis regard, there is a compelling need to include all\npeoples of the world, as envisaged by our founding\nfathers and as enshrined in the principle of universality.\nAcknowledging the importance of this principle,\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland raises once more the\nquestion of the inclusion of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan in the activities of the United Nations and its\n38\n\nassociated agencies. We appeal on behalf of the 23\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan for\ntheir right to representation in the United Nations\nOrganization. The Government and people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan have shown themselves\nto be wholly committed to observing the principles and\nspirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nand of the Charter of the United Nations.\nIn addition to the peaceful democratic transition\nthat took place last year, the recent admission of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade\nOrganization attests to the significant contribution the\nRepublic of China has made and will continue to make\nto international trade. The Republic of China on\nTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness to\nparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace,\ndevelopment and security, and its commitment to\nutilize its resources for the benefit of mankind.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been at the\nforefront of efforts to support the readmittance of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations.\nOur position on this important issue remains\nunchanged. We therefore appeal to our fellow Members\nto support the establishment of a working group to\nexamine in detail the exceptional international situation\nrelating to the Republic of China on Taiwan, with a\nview to ensuring that its 23 million people can\ncontribute actively to the international community\nthrough participation in the United Nations and its\nrelated agencies.\nAt the Millennium Summit, we the Member\nStates of the United Nations agreed to seize the\nopportunity to forge a new era of optimism for the\nworld, based on equality, peace and prosperity. That\nopportunity is fading fast, and we need to redouble our\nefforts and determination to make that vision a reality.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland renews its commitment to\nthe Charter and aims of the United Nations and offers\nto its fellow Members assurances of continued support\nfor all activities that will help the world to achieve a\nbetter future for all its peoples."

New York is a city\nwhose heart will forever hold the memory of the\nvictims of the human folly of 11 September 2001.\nTo the people and Government of the United\nStates, under the enlightened leadership of President\nGeorge Bush, we reiterate our deepest condolences. We\nalso thank them warmly for their welcome and for the\nfacilities placed at our disposal.\nOn behalf of the delegation of Madagascar, from\nthis United Nations rostrum I convey to Mr. Han\nSeung-soo our sincerest congratulations on his election\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. To\nhis predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, we pay well-\ndeserved tribute for the success of the Millennium\nAssembly.\nTo Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, we express our pride at the important\ndistinction he has recently been awarded. The Nobel\nPeace Prize that he has received is both a recognition\nof his unassailable competence and dedication as well\nas a reflection of the value of the United Nations and\nthe trust placed in it by the entire world.\nOur Organization is being confronted with new\nconcerns every day. It is called on to keep up with the\npace of international change in order to better fulfil its\nmission as a regulator of inter-State relations, a\nfacilitator of negotiations and a catalyst of\ndevelopment. The United Nations remains the supreme\ndecision-making body and the main guarantor of world\npeace and security.\nMadagascar supports profound reform and a\nstreamlining of the Organization\u2019s institutional\nstructure in order to improve its performance.\nMadagascar remains convinced and confident,\nhowever, that our Organization is still a privileged\nplatform for the exchange and harmonization of views.\nCreating together a climate of world peace and\nharmony; struggling in unity against poverty, the AIDS\npandemic, transnational crime and environmental\ndegradation; building in concert a better future for the\ncoming generation, our children, who are tomorrow\u2019s\ndecision-makers \u2014 these were the expectations voiced\nat the Millennium Summit in this very Hall. It was an\nambitious millennium, given the prospects and\nprogrammes of action projected up to the year 2015,\nand one of multiple challenges, given that objectives\nremain to be achieved and that we have a long road\nahead of us. Above all, it was a millennium for taking\nstock and moving forward, since the situation of human\nand economic development calls on us to rise to its\nexpectations and to overcome its hurdles.\nA world of well-being is what our children need\ntoday and tomorrow above all. The devotion of my\ncountry and my people to all questions relating to\nchildren is seen in our genuine commitment to\ninternational conventions. On 16 July 2001,\nMadagascar ratified International Labour Organization\nConvention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate\nAction for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child\nLabour. The Hague Convention on the Intercountry\nAdoption of Children is currently being considered by\nour Parliament. The implementation of the law of 1999\non paedophilia complements the Optional Protocol that\nwe signed in September 2000 regarding the sale of\nchildren, child prostitution and child pornography.\nWe welcome enthusiastically the decision to hold\nin May 2002 the Summit on the future of children. In\nview of our intention to participate in that event, a\nnational parliament of children has just been\nestablished this year.\nThe family must remain the basic core of society,\nthe foundation of the nation, a source of human dignity\n30\n\nand the guarantor of stable social development.\nConsequently, the family must be protected, as must be\nthe values associated with it.\nMadagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, thus\nfar little affected by the AIDS pandemic, is nonetheless\nnot indifferent to this scourge. A strategy and a\nprogramme to prevent and combat AIDS, within an\nestablished institutional framework, are being pursued\nby all State and non-State institutions in the country.\nHaving participated actively in the United Nations\nspecial session on AIDS in June 2001, Madagascar\nfully supports the resolutions adopted at that meeting.\nSince Africa has a wealth of medicinal plants, any\nresearch in this connection will benefit from consistent\nsupport.\nAfrica pledges resolutely, and with the full\nawareness of its responsibilities, to take its own destiny\nin hand. Positive development indicators are imminent,\nand are appreciated. Continental integration is\nunderway within an effective African Union. Regional\nmechanisms for African conflict management and\nprevention are already operational. The New African\nInitiative, including long-term development\nprogrammes for our continent, has benefited from the\nsupport of the international community.\nNonetheless, in the context of globalization, the\neconomic and commercial rules of the game are not\nalways in the developing countries\u2019 favour. We deplore\nthe widening gap between the economies of the\ncountries of the South and those of the countries of the\nNorth. The World Trade Organization, which is\nmeeting right now in Qatar, should further encourage\nthe advanced countries to give greater trade\npreferences to the developing countries. Given the\nnegative impact of a possible complete liberalization of\ntrade, the economy of the least developed countries\nmust be taken into consideration by the international\ncommunity, because any new multilateral contract\nengenders binding obligations.\nIntegration within regional markets will clearly\nmake it possible for our countries to adapt steadily to\nthe demands and constraints of the world market, while\npromoting intra-regional and South-South exchanges.\nWe expect of regional cooperation a concrete transfer\nof technology and know-how and a harmonization of\nstandards.\nMadagascar\u2019s economy has followed the\ndynamics of growth thanks to steadfast national efforts\nand an enterprising partnership. Madagascar joined the\nfree trade zone of the Common Market for Eastern and\nSouthern Africa (COMESA), on 31 October 2001. We\nhave benefited from the Initiative of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and from the\nrescheduling or cancellation of our debts by a number\nof our creditors. We are signatories of the Cotonou\nAgreement of July 2001, and are beneficiaries of the\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). All of\nthis bears witness to the confidence that the\ninternational community has in our country.\nHowever, out of solidarity with all low-income\ncountries, we believe that there is an urgent need to\nreview international policy regarding official\ndevelopment assistance. We welcome the holding in\nBrussels last May of the United Nations Conference on\nthe Least Developed Countries. The time has come for\nconcrete action, so that the objective of reducing\npoverty by half by the 2015 can become a reality.\nMadagascar has always been attentive to and\nconcerned by situations of international conflict, and\nmore particularly those that affect the African\ncontinent and the Indian Ocean area. In the framework\nof the Organization of African Unity and of the\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, we have\nsupported the Camoros in their process of national\nreconciliation and their return to constitutional\nnormalcy. We welcome the draft constitution prepared\nby the Tripartite Commission, which included different\ntrends and factions of the three reunited islands, and\nthe decision to hold the referendum next December.\nIt goes without saying that the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict claims our full attention. We believe it is\nimperative that a special session be convened on this\nquestion by the United Nations and also that an\ninternational force be deployed to protect the innocent\nvictims. We support the Palestinian people in its\nstruggle for independence and sovereignty. We also\nwelcome the continuation of peace negotiations\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\nLiberation Organization. The principle of land for\npeace must be respected. This must be done in keeping\nwith the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly\nand the Security Council.\nAfghanistan, a den of extreme poverty and hotbed\nof tension, has recently become a site of war. While the\nfight against terrorism is legitimate and is the\nresponsibility of all States Member of our\n31\n\nOrganization, support for refugees and the civilian\nvictims of war is a duty that shouts out at all of us.\nHumanitarian intervention is therefore imperative.\nMadagascar reiterates its commitment to\ndisarmament efforts, an essential element of the United\nNations strategy for peace and security, according to\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s most recent report (A/56/1).\nMy delegation welcomes the holding in July 2001 of\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Of\ncourse, we support the first global Programme of\nAction that was adopted. My country reaffirms the\nurgent need to implement the conventions of the United\nNations that condemn the production, proliferation and\nillicit sale of weapons. Madagascar is a party to several\nmultilateral treaties regarding disarmament. The Treaty\nof Pelindaba, which makes Africa a nuclear-weapons-\nfree zone, has just been ratified by our Parliament.\nOur reunion here in this Hall, in this large United\nNations family, reminds us that we are survivors, and\nthat it is only a matter of time before the terrorist\nsword of Damocles dangerously suspended over our\nheads, may again perpetrate its odious carnage. The\nfact that we have been spared compels us to mobilize\nand to coordinate a united and merciless struggle\nagainst terrorism.\nMadagascar, my country and its people, coming\nfrom a mixture of many cultural, religious and ethnic\nbackgrounds, reiterates its condemnation of the\nterrorist barbarity that struck a sister nation, with\nvictims of all nationalities having perished in the\nattacks of 11 September 2001.\nTerrorism is the very negation of everything that\nwe, as leaders of our different nations and institutions\ngathered here, do to make of this world a universe of\nlaw, humanity and lasting peace.\nMadagascar has already begun the process of\nratifying the 12 conventions against terrorism, and last\nOctober signed the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Likewise,\nwe will immediately proceed to sign the Protocol\nagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in\nFirearms. We support the draft comprehensive\nconvention against terrorism, submitted by India,\nwhich is based on existing conventions, with the\nemphasis placed on concrete measures that member\ncountries would be able to apply.\nInternational cooperation in police and judicial\ninvestigations must be consolidated, taking into\naccount exchanges of information on major trafficking\nactivity. This would require harmonization of\nlegislation and the establishment of multilateral\noperational structures for the prevention and\nsuppression of transnational crimes.\nThe threat of bioterrorism has in recent times\ncreated a psychosis of collective fear that has spread\nthroughout the world. This means that the international\ncommunity must design and urgently put in place\neffective protective measures against this danger. The\nConvention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is now\nbefore the Parliament of Madagascar for ratification. It\nis now imperative that we think deeply and on an\nongoing basis about the subject of terrorism.\nCombating terrorism also means identifying and\nunderstanding the causes of this scourge and\neradicating the evil at its very roots. In order to halt its\nramifications we must remove all sources of support,\nwhich involves destroying the many laboratories and\nbases for logistical backup and cutting off financing,\nweapons acquisition, fund-raising and proselytizing.\nOn the basis of that conviction, we are pleased\nthat our Organization has adopted the Programme of\nAction for dialogue among civilizations.\nIn accordance with the United Nations resolution\nmaking 2001 the International Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations, last October Madagascar organized a\nworkshop in which all those involved in our country\u2019s\ndevelopment participated. From the discussions\nemerged the notion that traditional cultures could serve\nas a point of reference for modern nations to design a\ncode of peaceful behaviour. The prevention of terrorist\nacts could also be complemented by educational and\ntraining programmes and information programmes on\nthe culture of peace.\nWe have proposed the establishment at the\nnational level of a non-aggression pact among the\ncountry\u2019s religious institutions in order to head off any\ndangers of religious war or other conflicts. This\ninitiative deserves to be expanded to a wider scale in\norder to ensure a climate of confidence and calm. We\nmust have the courage to denounce the excesses of\nfanaticism and religious extremism, which endanger\nour common values.\nThe time has now come for dialogue. It is not too\nlate to become aware of the value of dialogue. Having\n32\n\na dialogue does not mean tolerating misdeeds, nor does\nit mean any complicity with criminals, who must be\npunished. Above all, having a dialogue means going\nbeyond terrorism through a new understanding of the\nconcept of enemy. It is now time to hear each other,\nwith mutual respect and in a climate of understanding\nthat takes the other into account. It is now time for\nshared responsibilities and continued harmonization of\nviews for the establishment of a world of trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, allow me to\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan and all of\nmy colleagues on having received the Nobel Peace\nPrize. There is no doubt that without the United\nNations, our world would be much less secure, with far\nfewer prospects for resolving conflicts. I would also\nlike to commend the efforts that have been made\nduring the last few years to reform this Organization so\nthat it can better deal with the new challenges it has to\nface. In addition, please allow me, Sir, to congratulate\nyou on having been elected President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly.\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September, it\nbecame apparent that, when we are all confronted with\na common threat, many existing disputes and\n12\n\ndifferences become insignificant. The United Nations\nMember States together have condemned the terrorist\nacts. It is of the utmost importance to maintain that\nunity and persistently to reinforce it with concrete\nactions. Terrorism is the ultimate challenge to our\ncommon values, and our struggle against that threat has\nonly begun.\nThe destruction and elimination of terrorist\nnetworks is a time-consuming task for which there are\nno instant solutions. The United Nations does,\nhowever, have effective measures at its disposal for\nfighting terrorism: the international conventions that\nthe United Nations has adopted over the years and the\nsanctions that can be applied to hamper terrorist\nactivities. The ratification of those conventions and the\nenforcement of those sanctions by every United\nNations Member State is, at this moment, one of those\ntruly important tasks that it behoves all Members to\ncarry out. I am glad to be able to confirm that Estonia\nhas either already ratified, or is the middle of the\nparliamentary procedures for ratifying, all of the\nappropriate United Nations conventions. Estonia has\ntaken all necessary steps to apply Security Council\nresolutions 1333 (2000) and 1373 (2001).\nEstonia has improved and intensified cooperation\nand the exchange of information with its neighbours\nand partners. We have expressed our solidarity and\nunreserved support to the United States in the fight\nagainst terrorism. We have aligned ourselves with the\nEuropean Union\u2019s 21 September anti-terrorist summit\u2019s\nfinal document and action plan. With our neighbours\nLatvia and Lithuania, we have also formulated\ncommon measures for preventing possible terrorist\nattacks and for applying coordinated tactics in case we\nbecome the victims of terrorist activities. We have\nintensified international border controls and police\ncooperation.\nMany programmes that had been adopted earlier\nare now proving to be extremely useful in the struggle\nagainst terrorism. The Financial Action Task Force on\nMoney Laundering, for example, has given a high\nrating to Estonia\u2019s anti-money-laundering legislation.\nA recent audit shows that Estonian banks have no\ncontractual relations with any organization or\nindividual alleged to be connected with international\nterrorism.\nThe international political atmosphere in\nEstonia\u2019s immediate vicinity, the Baltic Sea region, is, I\nam glad to report, peaceful, which is conducive to\nstable development and good-neighbourly cooperation.\nUp to now, Estonians have hardly had to deal with the\ndirect results of terrorism. But this fall\u2019s terrorist\nattacks were aimed directly at international peace and\nstability. This means that now we, too, keenly sense the\ndanger that faces us all. This places the United Nations,\nas the world Organization, at the centre of the ongoing\nstruggle.\nThe reform processes launched during the last\nfew years to reorganize and reform the United Nations\nare also appropriate for dealing with current problems.\nNow, however, we must ask ourselves if there is some\nway that we can speed up and intensify these reforms\nso as to better deal with the urgency of the prevailing\nsituation. In our new situation, I would bring forth\nthree well-worn and proven principles that apply not\nonly specifically to the United Nations, but to other\naspects of international cooperation as well.\nFirst, we must once again ask ourselves how\nexactly each of us can make the most fruitful\ncontribution. Secondly, what can we do to increase the\nefficiency of the Organization? And thirdly, I would\nlike to stress the principle of openness.\nFirst of all, let us deal with the matter of every\nMember\u2019s individual contribution. The United Nations\nbrings together Member States with a wide range of\nresources and capabilities. Even the most successful\nnation\u2019s reserves and capacities, however, have a limit.\nTherefore, it is only natural that every Member State\ncarefully evaluate how it can be the most useful. It is\nequally important for Members to realistically assess\nhow high a level of development they have achieved,\nand, when appropriate, to refrain from accepting aid in\nfavour of those who need it the most.\nThis is the flip side of development. As one rises\nout of poverty and underdevelopment, one should also\ngrow up and become more responsible, acknowledging\nthat obligations rise along with living standards. Last\nyear, for example, Estonia decided to relinquish its\nright to pay reduced contributions to the peacekeeping\nbudget. For Estonia, to give up the rights to such a\ndiscount was not a step taken lightly \u2014 it was a\ndecision based on the Government\u2019s realization that\nwith our rapid development, we had acquired new\nresponsibilities. The United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP) had, after all, found that Estonia\nhad developed to the point where the UNDP could\n13\n\nterminate the activities of its mission in Estonia in\nDecember 2000.\nOf course, we miss working together with such a\nuseful cooperative agency as the UNDP representation\nin Estonia. Yet we realize quite well that there are\nmany regions in the world which badly need their\nassistance, while for Estonia the presence of the UNDP\nmission is no longer essential. In other words,\nmaintaining the representation would be irresponsible\non our part, as it would use resources for which there is\na greater need elsewhere. This means that Estonia\u2019s\ncooperation with the United Nations and its agencies\nhas qualitatively advanced to a higher level. This has\nbeen clearly demonstrated by the founding of the\nUnited Nations Building project in Estonia. The\nintention is to have the representation of various United\nNations agencies all under one roof. The fact that the\nUnited Nations is gaining importance in the eyes of the\nEstonian public is evidenced by, inter alia, the fact that\nthe Estonian United Nations Association has been\nsteadily increasing its activities.\nDuring the last few years, Estonia has clearly\nprogressed from an aid recipient to an aid provider.\nThis transformation has been confirmed by, among\nothers, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) Development Assistance\nCommittee, which, in its 2000 yearbook, lists Estonia\nfor the first time as a donor nation. Therefore, those\nwho assisted Estonia during its now completed\ntransition phase can clearly see now that their aid has\nborne fruit. We, in turn, are willing to share the\nexperience that we have gained in the course of the last\n10 years. As a matter of fact, we have already\nestablished cooperative efforts of this nature with\nseveral countries.\nI spoke earlier about how every Member State has\nan obligation to evaluate how it can best help the\nUnited Nations in its endeavours. Of equal importance\nare the ongoing efforts to increase the effectiveness of\nthe Organization as a whole. In this light, I would\nemphasize two aspects: reform of the Security Council\nand the Brahimi report on improving United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nWe must ensure that our cooperative efforts for\nsolving the urgent problems confronting us do not\nbecome entangled in the deficiencies of the structure or\nthe working order of the Security Council. We all know\nvery well what these deficiencies are, and therefore our\ncommon goal is quite clear: to increase the\nrepresentativeness, transparency and efficiency of the\nSecurity Council. The enlivened discussions and the\nshift towards greater openness in the work of the\nSecurity Council give us hope. We supported the\nstrenuous efforts of Harri Holkeri, the General\nAssembly\u2019s previous President, to intensify the\nactivities of the Working Group dealing with reform.\nWe share the view that it is time to move from\ndiscussions on to the negotiating phase.\nEstonia supports the enlargement of the Security\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories of membership, just as we support reform of\nthe Security Council\u2019s decision-making process. In the\nconfrontational context of the cold war, the veto in the\nSecurity Council was a means for the great Powers to\nprotect their interests. Even then it was avoided, and\nany light-handed use of the veto resulted in\ncondemnation by the international community. Now,\nhowever, the sense of trust among the Security Council\nmembers has grown immensely, and a limitation of the\nuse of the veto would be an appropriate reflection of\nthis improved atmosphere.\nThe composition of the Council, which still\nreflects the power relationships that prevailed in 1945,\nis another issue that cries out for resolution. From the\ninception of the United Nations that year until just a\ndecade ago, the people of my country were afforded\nonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the United\nNations through fissures in the iron curtain. When we\nfinally established our independence in 1991, we\nemerged into the international arena only to discover\nthat the Security Council, judging by its composition,\nwas still stuck back in the year 1945. This strikes\nEstonia as being anachronistic, if not wrong-headed.\nThe guarantors and greatest contributors to stability in\nthe world have, in the course of half a century, changed\nfundamentally. We need not fear opening a discussion\non whether the moral and legal reasoning underlying\nSecurity Council membership in the wake of the\nSecond World War is still appropriate in the post-cold-\nwar era \u2014 or this post-11 September era. Nothing\nunderscores the need to come back to this question\nmore than the challenge that we are currently facing.\nParticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping\noperations is an inseparable part of Estonia\u2019s national\nsecurity policy. We therefore fully support the\nendeavours outlined in the Brahimi report concerning\nthe reformation of United Nations peacekeeping.\n14\n\nEstonia is in full agreement with the report\u2019s\ncomprehensive and long-term approach to the\nprevention and solution of conflicts. Although we often\ntalk about the need for limiting expenditures, in this\ncase it is clear that in order to increase efficiency,\nmeans must be found for increasing the budget of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We are\npleased to say, as I mentioned earlier, that we have\ncontributed to this effort to increase those\nexpenditures.\nLet me proceed to my third theme, namely,\nopenness. Openness and transparency are essential for\nmany reasons. Terrorist attacks have been directed at\neveryday interpersonal relations and at our usual means\nof communication, such as the postal system and air\ntravel. Therefore, we need to make concerted efforts to\nensure that the movement of people and ideas will not\nsuffer from the threat of terrorism. Terrorism itself is\nfed primarily by misinformation, disinformation and\nmisperceptions. Here too, openness is important; it is\nessential to communicate our intentions and ideas both\nto those who support us as well as to those who doubt\nus.\nOpenness is also essential in more conventional\nsituations, for example, in the traditional political\ndecision-making process, be it in the international or\ndomestic arena. Here, Estonia can share experiences in\nthe sphere of information technology. Last year, the\nEstonian Government began to hold its cabinet\nmeetings electronically. All information concerning\ngovernment activities now moves through electronic\nchannels \u2014 through the Internet. In addition to\nspeeding up decision-making and providing monetary\nsavings, information now becomes available to the\ngeneral public through the Internet, much faster and\nmore efficiently. More and more Estonians are making\nuse of the opportunities offered by the public sector \u2014\nthe services of the revenue office, local governments\nand federal agencies \u2014 through the Internet. Having\nnow connected all Estonian public schools to the\nInternet, the Government also plans to bring all public\nlibraries online. This last summer, the Estonian State\nChancellery launched a unique new project by opening\na direct democracy portal called \u201cToday I Decide\u201d.\nThis portal allows everyone to present ideas, initiatives\nand proposals, as well as to comment upon proposed\nlegislation. New ideas that have been proposed by\nportal users are passed on to the appropriate\ngovernment offices and agencies for action. Many of\nyou may be interested in finding out more about the\ninitiatives I have described, and we are more than\nhappy to share our experiences with you.\nFinally, I would like to stress the fact that the\ngrave events that have affected all of us in the last few\nmonths will not prevent us from moving ahead. Our\ndecisiveness and sense of unity have only been\nreinforced by what has happened. We must not discard\nor forget all the common projects initiated before 11\nSeptember. In many parts of the world, nothing has\nchanged for those who suffer from poverty, hunger and\npersecution. Thinking about our projects for the future,\nI am especially pleased that the United Nations special\nsession on children, which was postponed owing to the\nterrorist attacks, will nevertheless take place in May\nnext year. The goal of this upcoming special session, to\ncreate better conditions and opportunities for children\neverywhere, continues to be of the utmost importance\nto us. It is precisely for initiatives of this kind, which\nendeavour to achieve a better future for mankind, that\nthe United Nations Organization has earned the Nobel\nPeace Prize.\nIn conclusion, please allow me to express my\npersonal condolences and the condolences of all\nEstonians to the families of those who perished in the\nair tragedy that occurred just a few days ago in the\nborough of Queens.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session of the General Assembly is\ntaking place in the shadow of an unprecedented\nchallenge to humanity posed by international terrorism.\nWe all must seriously analyse how this could have\nhappened. However, it has already become perfectly\nclear today that the period of globalization and the\nthreats and challenges to international and regional\nsecurity that it brings with it make it urgent for of all of\nus to take fundamentally new approaches to\ninternational affairs.\nWe face a tough dilemma, whose solution will\ntruly be of paramount importance. Either we work\ntogether to responsibly construct a genuinely just and\ndemocratic world order that can guarantee equal\nsecurity and sustainable development for all States in\nthe world, or we show ourselves to be unable to\ncounter real threats to global stability and security.\nThe most important task of the international\ncommunity today is to create a global system to\ncounteract new threats and challenges, first and\nforemost among which is international terrorism. This\ntopic was the focus of negotiations between the\nPresident of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir V.\nPutin, and the President of the United States of\nAmerica, Mr. George W. Bush, which recently took\nplace in Washington, D.C. and Crawford, Texas.\nA universal anti-terrorist coalition has been\nformed. The Russian Federation is a responsible\nparticipant in this coalition. The creation of this\ncoalition has involved the United Nations playing a\nvery important role in consolidating and coordinating\nactivities. It is precisely the United Nations that has the\nnecessary universal character and authority to organize\na response to the threats and challenges that confront\nmankind today.\nThe broad decisions taken by the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly create a solid\npolitical and legal framework for efforts to neutralize\nthe threat of terrorism. It is now important for these\ndecisions to be implemented by all States.\nIf necessary, the use of the most decisive means\nagainst terrorists may be permissible, including the use\nof military force. The Charter grants that right. At the\nsame time, this threat cannot be overcome by force\nalone. A comprehensive approach to eradicating\nterrorism would imply the use of the whole range of\npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian\nmeasures.\nThe consolidation of the international legal\nframework for combating terrorism is now on our\nagenda. It is extremely important to rapidly complete\nand adopt the comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism and a convention for the\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.\nIt would be of great importance to establish\nwithin the United Nations a mechanism to monitor the\nfulfilment by States of their treaty obligations\nconcerning the suppression of terrorism.\nWe consider promising the idea to establish,\nunder the aegis of the United Nations, a centre for\ncoordinating assistance to States to resolve crises\ncaused by terrorist acts. Such a structure could focus on\nproviding consultative and material and technical\nsupport in managing the consequences of terrorist acts.\nThe Russian Federation also proposes studying\nthe possibility of including in international law the\n5\n\nprinciple of the responsibility of States for their failure\nto take measures against terrorists in their territory or\nunder their jurisdiction.\nOf key importance in the success of the\ncomprehensive fight against international terrorism is\nthe maintenance and strengthening of strategic stability\nat both global and regional levels and strengthening the\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe focus of the international community should\ncontinue to be on the interdependence and merging of\ninternational terrorism, drug trafficking and\ntransnational organized crime. The Russian Federation\nfavours the rapid entry into force of the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism and the United Nations Convention Against\nTransnational Organized Crime and its additional\nprotocols.\nIt is perfectly clear that the fight against terrorism\nis not aimed at any particular religion, civilization or\nculture. This was clearly demonstrated by the\ndiscussions on the dialogue among civilizations during\nthe current session of the General Assembly. We also\nhope that a practical contribution in this area can be\nmade by the implementation of the initiative put\nforward by Islamic religious leaders from the Russian\nFederation to organize an international conference\nentitled \u201cIslam against terrorism\u201d in Moscow.\nTerrorism is rooted in the gap between affluence\nand poverty, both within States and in the international\narena. Thus, the task now, as never before, is to ensure\nsustainable development throughout the world and to\nensure that the social aspects of the globalization\nprocess are addressed.\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\ncan do a lot to ensure effective rejection of extremism\nof all forms. We suggest that thought should be given\nto organizing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a\nworld forum that would discuss what contribution civil\nsociety and, particularly, the mass media could make to\ncombating terrorism.\nInternational experience has shown that\nsuccessful prevention and settlement of regional\nconflicts are an integral part of the counter-terrorist\nefforts of the international community. This is yet\nanother compelling argument in favour of further\ndeveloping and ensuring greater effectiveness of\nUnited Nations preventive and peacekeeping activities.\nIn particular, the Russian Federation advocates the\ndevelopment within the United Nations of a\ncomprehensive strategy aimed at reliably blocking\nchannels for outside fuelling of the conflicts.\nWe need to ensure that there is regional\ncooperation in fighting these new threats. An example\nof such successful cooperation is that of the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, under the\nauspices of which a CIS anti-terrorist centre has been\nset up and is working effectively.\nToday, the moment of truth has arrived for each\nof us. The Russian Federation is in favour of the\ninternational community taking decisions that can\nprovide for strategic stability and equal security for all\nStates, sustainable development and prosperity for all\nthe peoples of the planet and peace and tranquillity for\neach family and each individual.\nThese noble aims can only be achieved jointly, by\nworking cooperatively and uniting the efforts of the\nentire international community. The United Nations has\na vital role to play in this regard. Our Organization\nwas, and indeed remains, the most important\ninstrument available to the international community,\nwhose effective and responsible use will allow us to\ncreate a new democratic and just world order for the\ntwenty-first century.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn view\nof the catastrophic events that took place on 11\nSeptember, it is only fitting that first and foremost we\nonce again offer our deepest condolences to the\nGovernment and people of the United States. This was\na hateful and diabolical act of terrorism that claimed\nthousands of precious human lives and caused untold\nphysical destruction, without parallel in history. This\nbrutal attack has put us all on notice. It was truly the\nday the world changed.\nOne way or another, this tragedy affects us all.\nNot a single country is immune from terrorism,\ninasmuch as it is beyond the capacity of any one\n27\n\ncountry to counter it. The international community\nmust work together, ideally through the United\nNations, so that the counter-measures take the form of\nlegitimacy and acceptability. In this respect, Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) provides us with the\nnecessary framework.\nWe in Djibouti have already established a suitable\nmechanism to counter terrorism, in all its aspects, that\ncould come from our territory. We are also in the\nprocess of examining the existing international\nconventions and protocols on terrorism with a view to\nsigning and ratifying them all. However, while doing\nall this, we must not lose sight of the plight of the\npeople of Afghanistan \u2014 the terror, the desperation\nand the starvation facing impoverished people during\nthis grave crisis. Also, we must not squander the\nextraordinary opportunity we now have to examine all\npossible or probable causes and deep roots of\nterrorism, including attitudes, frustrations and current\neconomic and political conditions.\nMay I join the delegations that preceded me to\noffer the President our congratulations on his brilliant\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-sixth session. His vast experience and\ndemonstrated capacity and skills will indeed be vital to\nour deliberations. We also wish to express our\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\nFinland, whose leadership at the fifty-fifth session has\nresulted in tangible achievements.\nPermit me also to congratulate Secretary-General\nKofi Annan on his re-election and for the work he\naccomplished during his first term, most notably for\nthe extent to which he was able to institute much-\nneeded reforms and restore the relevance and central\nrole of the United Nations, while enhancing its\ncapacity and effectiveness. He has recognized that far\ntoo many people live on the margins of society,\nreduced to silence by endemic poverty, debt, the AIDS\npandemic, tuberculosis and malaria. He has, in effect,\nbecome the voice of the world\u2019s silent majority. It is\nnot by chance, therefore, that, together with the\nOrganization he heads, he has received the Nobel\nPeace Prize. We congratulate him wholeheartedly for\nthis distinct and rare honour bestowed upon him and\nthe United Nations system.\nMay I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the\nbreadth and relevance of his report on the work of the\nOrganization. The United Nations has a vital role to\nplay in today\u2019s rapidly evolving world, and the report\noffers a comprehensive update on all its activities. With\nreference to peace and security, as the Secretary-\nGeneral has stressed, we must all be struck by the\nnumber of conflicts raging in the world today.\nPreventing the recurrence of conflict is a central\npriority, and this means that our focus needs to shift\nfrom a culture of management and control to one of\nprevention and long-term development.\nBesides conflict, we are witness to enormous\nhuman suffering caused by natural disasters and\ncomplex situations that continue to grow in scale,\nescalating the need for humanitarian assistance.\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General\ncontinues to place importance on the fight against\nendemic poverty and that the international community\nhas launched a sustained campaign to make the right to\ndevelopment a palpable reality for everyone. The\nparticipation of the poor must become a priority in\norder to eradicate rural poverty, to ensure the well-\nbeing of children and to strengthen the earning\npotential of women.\nIf we are to reduce by half the number of people\nliving in poverty by 2015, as called for in the\nMillennium Declaration, we must substantially increase\nOfficial Development Assistance, alleviate the debt\nburden of the poorest countries and dismantle the\nprotectionist barriers of developed countries. The Least\nDeveloped Countries, in particular, face enormous\nobstacles, such as declining inflows of capital,\ninadequate social services and the lack of\ninfrastructure, in addition to environmental constraints.\nIn essence, the Brussels Declaration and Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the\nDecade 2001-2010 call for an increase in foreign\ncapital inflows, including Official Development\nAssistance; direct foreign investment; an expansion of\ndebt relief; greater preferential market access and\nincreased technical assistance.\nSilently but very quickly, the world is drifting\ntowards another dangerous crisis: water scarcity. By\n2025, one in every three people worldwide will be\naffected by the lack of water. Some 2.7 billion people\nlive in regions facing severe water shortages and, once\nagain, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, which are the\nmost densely populated areas and among the areas of\nleast income, will be the hardest hit. Currently, 450\nmillion people living in 29 countries, including my\n28\n\nown, Djibouti, are experiencing acute drinking water\nshortages. Unlike oil and most other strategic\nresources, drinking water has no substitute. Whether\nwater is needed for drinking, agriculture or\nenvironment-related purposes, such as the survival of\nlakes and rivers, we have on our hands a potential\ncrisis that risks causing an unprecedented disaster for\nfood security and the fight against hunger and poverty.\nA combination of global warming, wasteful habits,\naridity and the lack of rainfall means that the water\nsources millions traditionally rely on are now slowly\ndrying up. There is no longer enough water for all our\nneeds. Beyond the international treaties and\ninstitutional mechanisms, the international community\nmust act to mitigate this crisis. Now is the time to act.\nWhile the recent international terrorist attacks in\nthe United States have rightly dominated the world\u2019s\nattention, other pressing problems, such as the AIDS\npandemic, must still be urgently attended to. The\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to this\nscourge, held in June, took a decisive step towards\nfinding collective solutions, actions and commitments.\nHowever, there is still concern that these non-binding\ncommitments may not be carried out. The global AIDS\nfund launched by the Secretary-General has made some\nprogress, but contributions to date have fallen far short\nof the expected target. We are now unfortunately\nfamiliar with the statistics of deaths and the social and\neconomic devastation caused by this scourge,\nparticularly in Africa. In the search for a solution and\nwhat measures to take, the debate has centred on\ntreatment versus prevention. Ideally, the best hope\nwould be for a preventative vaccine, but that solution\ndoes not look promising. As one expert put it, \u201cWe are\nat the end of the beginning of this epidemic, not at the\nbeginning of its end!\u201d\nThe growth and exponential spread of\ninformation technology, coupled with the demise of the\ncold war, have, over the past decade, been determining\nfactors in shaping our views on development and the\nglobal economy. With the advent of globalization, trade\nexpanded, capital flowed, investments increased,\neconomies liberalized and barriers to trade were\nlowered. In addition, the private sector took on a\ncentral role.\nUnfortunately, as many have correctly observed,\nthe number of countries and individuals excluded from\nthe benefits of this phenomenon has risen inexorably.\nThe attempt to explain this dichotomy has led to many\ntroubling conclusions. For the poverty-stricken who\nlive on $1 per day, talk of technology, economic\ngrowth, opportunity and prosperity is no more than\nnice-sounding words. Their greatest daily concern is\nthe fear of not having enough to eat. Finding enough to\neat is a daily challenge for more than three billion\npeople on this planet. Despite the conflicts in Africa\ncurrently making headlines, it is the precarious\nexistence of those left behind that has defined life on\nthe African continent for more than two generations.\nWhatever the reasons for this endemic poverty,\nthe fact remains that unless we address the problem of\npoverty in all its aspects, we will not get to the roots of\nthe problem. It is well known that millions of people in\nAfrica and throughout the world are simply too poor to\nparticipate in the phenomenon of globalization and thus\nmiss out on the benefits of globalization. The President\nof the World Bank has aptly put the issue of poverty in\nperspective:\n\u201c... if you cannot deal with the question of\npoverty, if you cannot deal with the issue of\nequity, then you are not dealing with the question\nof peace.\u201d\nHe added:\n\u201cWe will not solve the problems of poverty or\nglobal peace or stability unless we change our\nperception of poor people from the objects of\ncharity to an asset on which you can build a better\nworld.\u201d\nThe persistence and spread of poverty hamper all\nefforts for peace, security, development, democracy\nand good governance. Peace and security require\nincreasing and strengthening the United Nations\ncapacity to prevent crises, to react to emerging threats\nand to implement peace-building programmes. In this\nregard, the Security Council has a preponderant role. It\nis obvious that our inability to reform the Council so\nthat it can respond to the needs of the international\nreality of today can only diminish the legitimacy of its\nfunctioning and decisions.\nDuring the fifty-fourth session of the General\nAssembly in September 1999, my President, Ismail\nOmar Guelleh, outlined a series of proposals on the re-\nestablishment of peace in Somalia. A year later, during\nthe fifty-fifth session, he related to this Assembly the\nextraordinary sacrifices and burdens borne by the\nGovernment and people of Djibouti, together with a\n29\n\nnumber of Governments and organizations of good\nwill, to bring together the true representatives of the\nSomali people so that they might seize control of their\nown destiny and forge a new direction for their\ndevastated country.\nUltimately, after eight months of intense and\ndifficult negotiations at Arta, Djibouti, in August 2000,\nthe Somali State was reborn through the establishment\nof the Transitional National Government, the National\nAssembly and other institutions. The course has not\nbeen easy, but the Transitional National Government\nhas persisted and pursued its commitments, gaining the\nrespect, sympathy and support of the international\ncommunity, despite myriad attempts to undermine its\nefforts to achieve lasting peace.\nThe Transitional National Government is a\nreality. It represents the will of the people of Somalia,\nwho have spoken and made their choice. As my\nPresident has repeatedly stated, if we wish to save\nSomalia from disintegration and chaos, we must\neschew the standard practice of revolving around a few\nall-too-familiar individuals who held the Somali people\nhostage for a decade. He suggested, inter alia, that it\nwas time to move beyond them, to restore power to the\npeople, and for the Somali people to assume leadership\nand responsibility for their own destiny.\nWe are gratified that the Transitional National\nGovernment is fully committed to bringing about\nlasting peace in Somalia through a constructive spirit\nof dialogue and tolerance. Building upon the outcome\nof the Arta process, the Transitional National\nGovernment has consistently and tirelessly\ndemonstrated its unwavering commitment to\nreconciling with its adversaries without preconditions.\nIts efforts to that end have been greatly appreciated by\nthe Organization of African Unity and by the Security\nCouncil. Both entities have recently condemned those\nindividuals and faction leaders who remain outside the\nArta peace process and who stubbornly persist in\nblocking the peace efforts in Somalia.\nIn this respect, the efforts of the President of\nKenya, Mr. Daniel Arap Moi, earlier this month to\nbring some of these recalcitrants into the Arta process\nare to be strongly commended. That is what is expected\nof us; it is a moral and political duty we owe to the\npeople of Somalia. That was the message of the\nSecurity Council\u2019s presidential statement on Somalia\nlast month:\n\u201c[T]he situation in Somalia and the objective of\nlong-term regional stability can most effectively\nbe addressed if neighbouring States play a\npositive role, including in the process of\nrebuilding national institutions in Somalia.\u201d\n(S/PRST/2001/30, p. 2)\nWhile the Republic of Djibouti is not in the habit\nof challenging anyone on the veracity of information\nwithin their purview, it has nonetheless a moral duty to\nissue a caution about the source, motivation, accuracy,\nobjectivity and reliability of such information,\nparticularly as it relates to the crucial and sensitive\nissue of the existence of terrorist cells in one country or\nanother. I am convinced that close consultation and\ncooperation with all countries in the region on this\nimportant issue will yield realistic and impartial\ninformation in the assessment of any particular\nsituation. It must be pointed out, however, that haste\nand rash, uncorroborated conclusions will only harm\nthe unity of the international coalition against\nterrorism, which we all vigorously support.\nAt a time when the attention of the international\ncommunity is squarely focused on the issue of\nterrorism, the brutality and destructive force used\nagainst the Palestinians have increased dramatically.\nIsrael has created the conditions for chaos and anarchy\nto justify its reoccupation and even annexation of\nPalestinian territory. The recent incursions represent\nthe broadest military operations in years in Palestinian-\ncontrolled territory. Each day we drift closer to an\nunacceptable conflagration between two parties that are\nunequal in power, means, resources and international\ninfluence.\nInsisting on a ceasefire without offering anything\nin return, Israel is determined to pursue its defiance of\ninternational opinion. Living conditions in the\noccupied territories continue to be seriously affected by\nthe Israeli blockade. Rising unemployment, failing\nbusinesses, falling incomes, restrictions on the\nmovement of goods and people and the banning of\nconstruction while Jewish settlement activities\ncontinue all combine to inflame an already incendiary\nsituation. One wonders, therefore, what more the\nIsraelis want to hear than the imploring words of\nPresident Arafat: \u201cLet us go back to implementing the\naccords. Let us go back to saving the peace process\nwith no conditions and no military pressures.\u201d\n30\n\nWe call on Israel to relinquish Orient House and\nother Palestinian offices in and around Jerusalem. We\nalso urge it to return to the negotiating table and,\namong other things, to implement the proposals\ncontained in the Mitchell Committee report. Israel must\nrelease the millions of dollars in tax money owed to the\nPalestinian Authority in order to alleviate the economic\nand financial hardships inflicted upon the Palestinian\npeople.\nIn the final analysis, Israel\u2019s security largely\ndepends on the implementation of the principle of a\nviable Palestinian State. We hope that the international\ncommunity will also commit itself to restoring dignity\nand respect to the Palestinian people. Like all peoples\neverywhere, they have a right to live in peace and to\nenjoy a decent existence.\nIn our subregion of the Horn of Africa, there has\nbeen some reduction in hostilities despite lingering\ndifferences and antagonisms. The people in that area of\nthe world have suffered too long and desire nothing\nmore than a relaxation of tensions, the free movement\nof people and goods, lasting peace, stability,\ndevelopment and cooperation. It is high time that we\ndevoted our meagre resources to development and to\nimproving the living conditions and meeting the needs\nof our own people. Let us give our people a break and a\nbetter future.\nDjibouti truly believes in regional cooperation,\ngood-neighbourliness and the opportunities they can\nafford for all our people. We are committed to working\nhand in hand with our friends in the subregion to\nresolve outstanding issues in complete harmony and\ntrust. As a nation, we are challenged by scant resources\nand declining international assistance, which have been\nexacerbated by the huge influx of drought-affected\npeople and economic migrants. Our capital city, in\nparticular, is overburdened by an influx of people\ndisplaced by drought or political tensions in the region,\nthus further straining our limited infrastructure and\nsocial services. We appeal to the international\ncommunity to help us overcome these unsustainable\nchallenges and pressures that have been with us for too\nlong and are beyond our limited means.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nIndonesian delegation, I am pleased to congratulate\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at the fifty-sixth session. We are\npleased that the stewardship of this session has been\nentrusted to so capable a diplomat from a fraternal\nAsian country, with which Indonesia has always\nenjoyed the most cordial of relations.\nI wish to preface my statement by expressing\nonce again, on behalf of the Government and people of\nIndonesia, our deepest condolences and sympathy to\nthe Government and people of the United States with\nregard to the massive tragedy that they suffered\nrecently, and have borne so admirably.\nIndeed, international terrorism today looms on\nthe horizon as one of the major threats to human life\nand civilization. The truth, of course, is that multiple\nthreats and challenges are an inherent and coexisting\nfeature of inter-State relations. We cannot grapple with\nthis threat and leave other threats to wreak havoc on\nthe world. It is the urgent and compelling task of this\nworld Organization to address them all, for each of\nthem has the potential to destroy a large part, if not all,\nof the human race.\nThe threat of nuclear annihilation is still there. It\nhas by no means faded with the demise of the cold war,\nas the campaign for nuclear disarmament remains\nstalled. With conventional weapons, mostly small arms,\nwars and other forms of mass violence are being\ncarried out in various parts of the world. Thus, whole\npopulations \u2014 involving millions \u2014 are being\ndisplaced, maimed or killed, 90 percent of whom are\ncivilians, and the majority of them women, children\nand the elderly.\nIn the Middle East, the killing of innocent\nPalestinians continues even while Israeli forces\npartially withdraw from occupied Palestinian towns.\nFor as long as the inalienable right of the Palestinians\nto self-determination is being violated with impunity,\nthere can be no lasting peace in that part of the world.\nIn the economic sphere, we have not been able to\nsolve the basic problem of poverty in spite of the fact\n4\n\nthat we have the resources and the technical capability\nto at least wage an effective war against this scourge of\nhumankind.\nThe economies of South-East Asia have just\nbegun to recover from the devastation of a global\nfinancial crisis that erupted just a few years ago and\nalready we are facing the unwelcome prospect of its\npossible recurrence. New international architectures\nthat would shield vulnerable economies from such a\ncrisis remain a distant dream. The global economic\nenvironment is simply getting less hospitable to the\naspirations of the developing world for growth.\nWithout the resources and technology for sustainable\ndevelopment, developing countries are rapidly losing\ntheir natural resources, while the physical environment\nof the world continues to deteriorate.\nTo us Indonesians, these global problems become\neven more poignant as they are replicated in our\ncountry and as they impact on the lives of our people.\nIn the financial crisis of 1997-1998, as the rupia\nplummeted in value and factories and businesses closed\ndown, millions lost their jobs and were reduced to\nabject poverty. Since then, our economy has begun to\nrecover. Last year, Indonesia enjoyed an economic\ngrowth of some 5 per cent, in contrast to the 13.5 per\ncent contraction that followed the onset of the financial\ncrisis in 1997. Also, in the year 2000, Indonesia\nattained a level of trade that surpassed those achieved\nbefore the crisis. However, the current global economic\ndownturn, compounded by the events of 11 September,\nhas lowered the expected target for economic growth to\n3 per cent in 2001.\nIn the face of these realities, we need massive\ndirect investment flows in order to consolidate our\nrecovery and march steadily on the road of\ndevelopment. We feel that the situation in Indonesia\ntoday already merits the confidence of investors, but\nwe can barely make a good case for this in the light of\nlingering threats to the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of our Republic.\nLike many other developing countries \u2014 and,\nindeed, some developed countries \u2014 Indonesia needs\nto overcome the problem of graft and corruption in its\nbureaucracies and in the corporate sector. The\ndeficiencies of our legal system and judiciary and the\npast human rights record of our police and military\nestablishment have produced less than optimum\nconditions for Indonesia\u2019s economic recovery. These\nare daunting challenges, as daunting as the global\nproblems that they replicate and reflect.\nYet, in confronting these national problems, I do\nnot despair, just as I do not despair in contemplating\nthe global challenges and problems of our time. I\nbelieve that all these problems, global and national, can\nbe traced to a single common root \u2014 a deficiency in\nhuman relationships \u2014 for wherever there is inequality\nand it is not acceptable to the weaker party, there can\nonly be tension and conflict. Wherever the powerful\ncan get away with exploiting the weak, a sense of\noutrage smoulders and there can be neither stability nor\npeace. Wherever there is injustice and it is not\nredressed, there arises a culture of vengeance.\nIf the problem is basically an imbalance in human\nrelationships, then the solution lies in the rectification\nof that imbalance \u2014 in the recognition that all human\nbeings are of equal worth and have basically equal\nrights before the law of God and human law. As they\nare all equals, each is accountable for what he does to\nany other and everyone\u2019s common sense of justice is\nsatisfied.\nThis solution is not something I discovered on my\nway to this forum. It is something that we all have\nknown for a very long time now, and we have been\ncalling it democracy. Against the expectations of many\noutside \u2014 and, indeed, within \u2014our own nation over\nthe past three years, and especially the last six months,\nand in the midst of our financial crisis, Indonesia has\nrelentlessly pursued the difficult process of reform and\ndemocratization. We have been able to manage\nsuccessive transitions of power in a democratic,\npeaceful and constitutional manner.\nThus, Indonesia today stands proud as one of the\nlargest democracies in the world. As a nation with an\noverwhelmingly Muslim population, we are the living\nrefutation of the erroneous notion that Islam and\ndemocracy are incompatible. Islam has always stood\nfor the equality and fraternity of all human beings and\nfor the optimum exercise of the human will. If only in\nthat, we Indonesians have a natural affinity for\ndemocracy.\nThe challenge for all of us is to ensure that\ndemocracy works and that it does actually deliver a\nbetter life for the people. In the case of Indonesia,\npivotal to this outcome is the recent introduction of\nbold and far-reaching measures on the relationship\nbetween the central Government and regional\n5\n\nauthorities in order to address the legitimate aspirations\nof the societies in the region. Likewise, my\nGovernment has made a democratic response to the\nchallenge of separatism in Aceh and Irian Jaya.\nWe will sincerely bring redress for their\ngrievances. We will meet their legitimate demands by\nintroducing special autonomy and a greater sharing of\nresources, and guarantee respect for their culture and\nethnic identities. We will not, however, tolerate any\nacts of terror or violence for separatist ends against the\nterritorial integrity and national unity of our Republic.\nIn this regard, Members of this Organization have\nextended overwhelming support for Indonesia\u2019s\nterritorial integrity and national unity, consistent with\nthe principle of the territorial integrity of States\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\nThrough the strict and impartial enforcement of\nrecently passed anti-graft laws, we are cleansing our\nbureaucracy and corporate sector of the taint of graft\nand corruption. Through strict and equal application of\nlaws on economic reform, we assure every\nentrepreneur an equal chance in his business\nundertakings.\nWe are reforming the legal system and the\njudiciary so that every individual stands equal before\nthe law, whoever his adversary in litigation may be.\nBoth the police and the military have undergone reform\nand have proven themselves to be faithful to the\nConstitution and to the democratic process. They have\nthe encouragement of my Government and the\nIndonesian people as they continue reforming\nthemselves.\nWe will see to it, however, that those who have\nperpetrated human rights violations, including those\nwho carried out the gross human rights violations in\nEast Timor in the wake of the popular consultation, are\nbrought to justice. Thus, immediately after assuming\noffice, President Megawati Soekarnoputri signed an\namending presidential decree that would enable,\nstarting next month, an ad hoc human rights court to\nadjudicate cases of human rights abuses prior to and\nfollowing the popular consultation.\nThese are the main lines of our democratic\nresponse to the many and formidable challenges that\nIndonesia must contend with. I have no illusions that\nthey will be met without difficulty and occasional\nsetbacks, but I have faith in the rightness of working\nfor human relationships that are based on the equality\nof individual human worth. It is the decent, enlightened\nthing to do. I therefore have no doubt that, ultimately,\nthese measures will yield sufficiently positive results to\nmove us forward on the road of development.\nI am no less confident that the democratic\nresponse will be just as effective in addressing the\nglobal challenges of our time. Consider the problem of\narmed conflicts in various parts of the world. The use\nof violence against other human beings, whether\ncarried out through nuclear weapons or through small\narms, is an assertion of a view that those others have no\nequal right to life. That is why violence is escalating\neverywhere and that is why there are terrorists \u2014\nmadmen who regard the lives of innocent people as\nworthless compared to their political agenda. In a\ndemocratic setting, where everyone is committed to\nequality and every human life is as precious as any\nother, violence cannot thrive, certainly not on a\nmassive scale.\nIf the nuclear disarmament agenda has not been\nmoving forward, it is because the nuclear Powers enjoy\na real advantage over everybody else and those that are\nnuclear-capable strive to become nuclear Powers\nthemselves. Inequality thus becomes an incentive for\nnuclear proliferation. In a democratic setting, that\nincentive is not available.\nThe same is true with respect to the endeavours to\nreform the United Nations, particularly the Security\nCouncil. So long as the present permanent members\nsee others as not equal to themselves and act on that\nbasis, there will never be equitable representation on\nthe Council. To say that we are reforming the world\nOrganization in order to make it more democratic is to\nput the cart before the horse. First, let us all embrace\ndemocracy and then it will not be difficult to reform\nthe United Nations.\nIn the economic sphere, the fundamental\nchallenge is simply to create a level playing field for\nall nations, whether it be in trade or international\nfinancial flows. We may all be paying lip service to the\nsovereign equality of all nations, but if a reality check\nshows that multilateralism is on the wane, that in fact\nmeans that a good number of developed nations do not\nreally believe that the developing countries thus\ndeprived are their equals.\nInternational financial flows for development will\nresume, the debt burden of poor countries will be eased\nand barriers to the exports of developing countries will\n6\n\nbe lifted if and when the entire developed world\nsincerely regards the developing countries as true\nequals, and not as recipients of charity. Since people in\ndeveloping countries, particularly those that are most\nvulnerable, are down today, they need a helping hand\nto raise them to a position commensurate with their\ndignity as equal human beings. In this regard, a special\ncase could be made for the teeming millions in the\ncountries of Africa, a continent that has already given\nso much of itself to the rest of the world.\nThe principle of equality among all human beings\nmust be applied as well in the use of natural resources\nand its profound impact on the environment. It would\nbe the cruellest form of inequality if the present\nimbalances in the use of resources among nations were\nleft unaddressed and if the present generation were to\nuse the earth\u2019s resources and leave nothing to sustain\nfuture generations of humanity.\nThis yearning for democracy has been with us for\na long time. It is the spirit behind every reform\nmovement, the French and American revolutions and\nthe struggle of colonized countries for independence,\nIndonesia among them.\nThis is the spirit to which the first generation of\nleaders of Asia and Africa gave voice in Bandung in\n1955. It guided the founding and the growth of the\nNon-Aligned Movement and brought about the demise\nof apartheid.\nIn my region, South-East Asia it gave rise to the\nbirth and growth of the Association of South-East\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), just as it earlier ushered in\nthe founding and enlargement of the United Nations. It\nis what we need today to reform the United Nations, to\nmake it a more effective instrument of global peace and\ndevelopment. It is what we need to translate into\nconcrete reality the provisions of the Millennium\nDeclaration. And, indeed, the democratic spirit is what\nwe need in order to wage an effective struggle against\nthe dark forces of international terrorism. Without that\nspirit, we can only fail.\nThe best course, therefore, would be to launch\ncollective action on the basis of the United Nations\nCharter. For this war against international terrorism to\nbe able to cover all fronts and to be sustainable and\nimbued with long-term legitimacy, it is imperative that\nthe United Nations play an active and primary role.\nThe global campaign should be complemented at the\nregional level by coordinated efforts such as those\nlaunched by ASEAN just over a week ago. In that way,\nwe will ensure that our response to terrorism is a\ndemocratic one.\nIndonesia has consistently emphasized the role of\nthe United Nations in addressing the unfolding\ndevelopments in Afghanistan. It therefore welcomes\nthe adoption yesterday by the Security Council of\nresolution 1378 (2001), for this development represents\nmanifest recognition of the need to enhance political\nand diplomatic efforts to find a comprehensive solution\nto the Afghan crisis. At the same time, however, it is\nimportant to underline that the role of the United\nNations can only be to support the efforts of the\nAfghan people themselves, most notably in the\nestablishment of a new and transitional administration\nthat is broad-based, multi-ethnic and representative of\nall the Afghan people. For its part, Indonesia is\ncommitted to supporting the United Nations in these\nnoble endeavours. Indonesia stands ready to contribute\nto any future peacekeeping operations needed to\nsupport peace-building in Afghanistan.\nTo my mind there is no question of whether the\ndemocratic response will work as a way of resolving\nthis problem and all the other global problems of our\ntime. Nothing else will work. The question is whether\nwe are courageous, sincere and enlightened enough to\napply it.\nHistory, it has been said, is a race between\nenlightenment and catastrophe. Let us become\nenlightened now, before catastrophe overtakes us.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to express our deep\nsatisfaction at seeing Mr. Han Seung-soo presiding\nover the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. For my delegation, the peaceable nature and\nspirit of dialogue that identify and distinguish his\ncountry, the Republic of Korea, together with his\noutstanding qualities as a diplomat and tireless\nnegotiator \u2014 all of which he has demonstrated since\nthe beginning of this session \u2014 are guarantees for the\nsuccess of our work. He can rely on the support and\ncooperation of Equatorial Guinea.\nTo the Secretary-General, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, we wish to express our sincere\ncongratulations on his re-election for a second term to\nlead the United Nations and the distinction conferred\non him and the United Nations as recipients of the\nNobel Peace Prize. We also commend the clear-\nsightedness and resolve that he has shown in exercising\nhis responsibilities to revitalize this Organization and\nconfirm its role at a time in which peace, security,\nstability, development and understanding are\nincreasingly precarious. We wish the Secretary-General\nevery success in his endeavours to carry out the\npurposes enshrined in the Charter. To this end, he may\nrely on our full trust and support.\nI would not wish to proceed any further with my\nstatement without first expressing our most sincere and\nprofound condolences to the Government and fraternal\npeople of the Dominican Republic and to all the\nfamilies that have been affected by the tragic and\nappalling plane crash that occurred on 12 November\n2001. May God receive all the victims into his\nkingdom.\nThis regular session of the General Assembly has\nbeen one of mourning, because it is taking place at a\ntime when the international community, without\nexception, feels that it is being dragged back towards a\npast that it thought had receded into oblivion. Now,\nmore than ever, since 11 September 2001, the need for\nsecurity, stability, justice, equity and balance has\nbecome a vital imperative and the highest of priorities.\nThe General Assembly is faced with a dilemma:\nto evaluate the level of implementation of the\ncommitments undertaken in the framework of the\nDeclaration of the Millennium Summit and at the\nspecial sessions of the General Assembly, before and\nafter the Summit, and other international conferences,\nwith a view to adopting the new strategies required, in\nthe light of the failures that have been registered in\nvarious fields of activity, while at the same time, tuning\nup and activating all the mechanisms required for the\nstruggle against and eradication of terrorism, since this\nis a common enemy, with no identifiable face or\nlocation.\nPeoples and their Governments constantly face\nthe arduous, complex and inescapable obligation and\nduty to adapt to new realities and demands that loom\nahead in the immediate or remote future. For this\nreason, Equatorial Guinea concurs with and maintains\nthe opinion that this task cannot and should not rest on\nthe shoulders of one people or one Government or any\nindividual country in an isolated fashion. It should be\nborne within a collective body such as the United\nNations.\nWe believe and maintain that the United Nations\ncontinues to be the best option and best centre for\nindispensable agreements, with all the wealth that its\ndiversity brings, for the purposes of conflict\nprevention, crisis management, rapprochement among\npeoples and enhancement of cooperation among States\non the bilateral, subregional, regional and\nintercontinental levels. For this reason, the\nOrganization must be endowed with the means it\nrequires to organize international society, working to\ncombat intolerance, persistent tension and conflict and\nthe worsening economic situation of poor countries.\nIn this regard, in the light of recent positive\nexperiences, we advocate greater, closer and more\neffective cooperation between the United Nations and\nregional integration groupings, in general, and with the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the\nEconomic Community of Central African States\n(ECCAS), in particular.\nTogether with the need to give the United Nations\nthe means to enhance its capacity, we believe that the\ntime is likewise ripe for both States and international\norganizations, including the financial agencies, to take\n29\n\nspecific and positive steps, without delay, aimed at\ndemocratizing international relations, promoting and\nreaffirming respect for human rights and consolidating\nthe disarmament regime and directing the investment\nof military expenditures to international action to\npromote development. Equatorial Guinea is continuing\nto work towards these objectives through an\ninstitutionalized national dialogue involving the\npolitical forces of the country.\nEquatorial Guinea shares in and insists on the\nvital need to democratize the Security Council, setting\nup the greatest possible interlocking and coordination\nbetween the work and tasks of that body and the\nresponsibilities of the General Assembly.\nIn spite of the success that has been achieved in\nsome countries and regions in the area of peacekeeping\nand peace-building, it is still disquieting to note that\nthese successes have served as culture media that have\nencouraged areas of tension to persist indefinitely or\nallowed other threats to peace to erupt. In fact, as the\nUnited Nations is redoubling and improving the efforts\nof peacekeeping and peace-building missions, the\nSecretary-General has noted in his report on the work\nof the Organization: \u201cGlobal military expenditures\nhave continued to rise \u2026 Although official\ndevelopment assistance levels have continued to fall \u2026\nmilitary budgets have risen persistently.\u201d (A/56/1,\npara. 76)\nThe same concern about the absence of peace\napplies to the sorry and disheartening aspect of\ncooperation to eradicate poverty. For the United\nNations and its Development Group and certain non-\ngovernmental organizations are striving to translate\ninto reality the decision taken at the Millennium\nSummit to combat poverty and make globalization an\ninclusive and not exclusive phenomenon.\nEquatorial Guinea associates itself with the\nprinciple of shared responsibility, taking the standpoint\nthat the problems that continue to face the least\ndeveloped countries are indeed the cause of the lack of\nprogress achieved in working towards international\nobjectives of human and social development. We hope\nand trust that the Brussels Declaration and Programme\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the\nDecade 2001-2010 and the outcome of the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, scheduled to be held in Monterrey,\nMexico in May 2002, and other pertinent instruments\nwill lay the best possible bases for effective\ncooperation for development.\nAs I noted earlier, Equatorial Guinea expresses its\nsatisfaction at the reduction of tensions in some\ncountries and regions. At the same time, it calls on and\nencourages the parties involved in areas where\nconflicts and disputes are born and persist to redouble\ntheir efforts and to use their capabilities and potential\nto seek peaceful solutions through peaceful\nnegotiations.\nIn this context, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms that\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China is the sole State entity\nthat is representative of the Chinese people.\nWe also welcome the recent initiative to resume\nthe North-South dialogue for the peaceful reunification\nof the Korean peninsula, and we support the principles\nendorsed and the responsibilities assumed by the\nGovernments of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of\nKorea and the Republic of Korea.\nAt a time when the United Nations is fully\nengaged in the search for solutions to alleviate the\nmany evils besetting peoples in all corners of the\nworld, through the adoption of strategies and\nprogrammes of action to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic\nto mention just one example, the illegal traffic in\nweapons and drugs, drug addiction, the mortgaging of\nthe lives of children through their traffic and easy\nrecruitment into the armed forces, discrimination\nagainst women, and so forth, the international\ncommunity\u2019s attention has been diverted by unusual\nevents such as the unprecedented terrorist act of 11\nSeptember 2001.\nThe acts carried out against the United States of\nAmerica on 11 September were undoubtedly attacks\nagainst the United Nations. The prevailing atmosphere\nof the current session of the General Assembly, a year\nafter the adoption of the Millennium Declaration by an\nunprecedented attendance of 147 heads of State and\nGovernment and a total of 189 Member States, and the\ntemporary postponement until next year of the General\nAssembly\u2019s special session on children are eloquent\nexamples, among others, of the challenge and the\ndilemma faced by the United Nations.\nIn that context, we reiterate the most vigorous\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and facets,\nand we reaffirm the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s\nfull support for and solidarity with the people and\n30\n\nGovernment of the United States of America at this\npainful and worrisome time, which will be difficult to\nforget.\nThe country\u2019s competent constitutional organs are\ncurrently adopting measures for the integration of the\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea into existing relevant\ninternational conventions on the prevention and\nsuppression of international terrorism, as part of its\nresponse to the Joint Declaration on Terrorism, adopted\nin Brussels on 11 October, and the Dakar Declaration\nagainst Terrorism, signed on 17 October 2001, as well\nas relevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nAs the Secretary-General\u2019s report forcefully\npoints out, the Millennium Declaration insists on the\nneed to promote and intensify institutional cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and regional and\nsubregional organizations:\n\u201cIn an increasing globalized world, none of\nthe critical issues we are dealing with can be\nresolved within a solely national framework. All\nof them require cooperation, partnership and\nburden-sharing among Governments, the United\nNations, regional organizations, non-\ngovernmental organizations, the private sector\nand civil society.\u201d (A/56/1, para. 11)\nIn this context, and on behalf of the member\nStates of the Economic Community of Central African\nStates (ECCAS), over which Equatorial Guinea is\npresiding, we reiterate our deepest recognition of the\ngreat support offered by United Nations Member States\nwith respect to resolutions 55/22 and 55/161, on\ncooperation between the Organization of the United\nNations and ECCAS and the observer status conferred\non the latter organization.\nGiven the prevalence of the informed political\nwill of ECCAS States to put an end to conflicts, the\nloss of innocent lives, the destruction of economic and\nsocial infrastructures and extreme poverty in rural\nareas, we hope and are convinced that the General\nAssembly will once again pronounce itself in favour of\nthe implementation and improvement of cooperation\nbetween the United Nations and ECCAS in order that\nthe latter may direct its potential \u2014 individual and\ncollective \u2014 towards alleviating the new challenges\nstemming from globalization and liberalization, for the\neconomies of the subregion. This would enhance the\npath to democracy, respect for human rights and the\nrule of law in the subregion, within the context of the\nexcellent and tireless work being carried out by the\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa.\nI would be remiss if I did not, on behalf of the\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, His\nExcellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, convey to\nthe Assembly his greetings and sincere wishes for\nsuccess and prosperity to each and every participant.\nHis Excellency had expressed his wish to attend, and\nregrets not being able to be present at these\ndeliberations.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate you,\nSir, on your election to the presidency of this session.\nWe are confident that the posts you held in your\ncountry and the respect you enjoy will facilitate your\ntask in leading the deliberations of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the efforts he\nmade last year to lead the work of the previous session\nto a successful conclusion. Let me also congratulate\nMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second term as\nSecretary-General of our international Organization\nand on winning the Nobel Peace Prize, together with\nthe United Nations. I would like to assure him that our\ncooperation with him will continue in order to\nconsolidate the role of the United Nations in various\ndomains.\nThe international and regional circumstances\nprevailing since the events of last September have cast\na dark shadow on our work. The new world order,\nwhose emergence was announced after the\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union and the Gulf war,\nsoon faltered, due to the failure or lack of desire to\nadopt the language of dialogue in order to eliminate\nhostile climates and the refusal to apply equal\nstandards in international relations to resolve regional\nconflicts, and due to the adoption of the method of\ndaily crisis management, which consists of addressing\nonly surface issues, instead of delving deep into the\nroot causes and addressing them according to the\n23\n\ncriteria of justice, international legitimacy and human\nsolidarity.\nThe world watched in disbelief the horrifying\nattacks on Washington, D.C., and New York. We in\nSyria and in the Arab world did not hesitate to\ndenounce those attacks and to condemn them in the\nstrongest possible terms. In the aftermath of those\nattacks, we also called for international cooperation\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to uproot\nterrorism in all its forms. Likewise, we called for an\nagreement on measures to define terrorism in an effort\nto guarantee effectiveness in combating it and in\naddressing its root causes.\nThe phenomenon of terrorism is not confined to a\nparticular society, culture or religion. It has appeared,\nand is still appearing, in many countries made up of\nnumerous groups with different demands, beliefs and\nobjectives. That is why it is a gross injustice and is\ntotally unrealistic to link terrorism to Arabs and\nMuslims. Suffice it to mention, for example, a number\nof infamous terrorist organizations such as Bader-\nMeinhoff gang, in Germany, the Red Brigades, in Italy\nand Japan, and what has been taking place in Northern\nIreland and in Spain, not to mention the various\nextremist organizations in the United States of\nAmerica.\nThose who link terrorist acts to Islam ignore the\nfact that Islam respects all monotheistic religions, calls\nfor tolerance among their followers and prohibits the\nkilling of innocents or acts of aggression against their\nproperties. But the pressing question now is how to\neliminate from the minds of American citizens the\nfeeling of hatred against Arabs and Muslims, feelings\npromoted by tens of thousands of publications, articles\nand films for the last 50 years.\nSenior officials at the highest level in the\nAmerican Administration and in European countries\nhave warned against linking terrorism to Arabs and\nMuslims and have issued positive statements. But,\nregrettably, those statements, though important, cannot\nerase the long history of defamation in books and films\nthat have distorted the image of Arabs and remain in\ncirculation. Moreover, we have recently heard that new\nfilms are being made, and books being prepared for\npublication, that incite feelings of hatred and link\nterrorism to Arabs and Muslims, thereby manipulating\nthe tragic events of September.\nSyria has always stressed the need to work on all\nlevels to combat international terrorism in all its forms\nand in a way that is consistent with the principles and\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Syria\nwas the first country to call, in 1985, for the convening\nof an international conference under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations to define terrorism and to differentiate\nit from the struggle of peoples for national liberation.\nIn response to a request by Syria, an item was listed on\nthe agenda of the General Assembly, stressing the\nimportance of determining the root causes of terrorism\nand taking appropriate measures to prevent it, combat\nit and address its root causes.\nSyria has also called upon all countries to take the\nnecessary measures at the national, regional and\ninternational levels to combat terrorism and implement\nthe provisions of international law and relevant\ninternational resolutions, with the aim of preventing\nthe perpetration of terrorist acts or their financing and\ninciting. We would also like to indicate that, since\n1952, the Syrian Arab Republic has been one of the\nfirst countries to adopt firm national laws and\nlegislation to combat terrorism.\nInternational terrorism is not a new phenomenon.\nSyria and other Arab countries have also been victims\nof terrorism. For years we have called upon the\ninternational community to condemn all types of\nterrorism, especially the State terrorism practised by\nIsrael. In this context, I would like to refer to the\nvalues of tolerance that have distinguished our region\nthroughout history. Our region had never known the\nphenomenon of terrorism until after Israel was created\non the basis of religion, in 1948, supported by the\nefforts of such well-known terrorist organizations as\nthe Irgun, Tzioni, the Stern gang, the Lehy and the\nHaganah, which were responsible for sowing the seeds\nof terrorism and fear in Palestine and outside it.\nIsrael has invented new types of terrorist\npractices in order to continue its occupation of Arab\nterritories. It expelled Palestinians from their homes\nand lands and perpetrated numerous massacres,\nbeginning with the massacre of Deir Yassin in 1948, to\nthat of Beit Reima just a few weeks ago. But despite\nthat, it has not been held accountable for these crimes.\nThe Palestinian people have, therefore, had no\nalternative in their struggle to rid themselves of their\nstate of frustration, despair and international disregard\nfor their plight but to start one uprising after another as\n24\n\na way to liberate their lands from occupation and to\nrestore their dignity like any other people in the world.\nWhat is both odd and surprising is that whenever\nPalestinian refugees and their organizations residing in\nSyria are mentioned, the United States describes them\nas terrorist organizations and considers the country that\nhosts them as one that sponsors terrorism. It ignores\nthe fact that Israel was completely responsible for\nuprooting those Palestinians from their homes,\nexpelling them from their homeland and denying them,\nup until this very moment, their right of return in\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 194\n(III). Regrettably, there are some countries and certain\nmedia outlets that believe those claims and describe\nthose Palestinian organizations as terrorist. They do not\nstop there, but extend that allegation to Syria as well,\ninstead of condemning Israel and expressing\nappreciation to Syria for hosting about 500,000\nPalestinian refugees and offering them work, security\nand a dignified life.\nBut in any case the request on the part of Israel\nand those who support it to have these Palestinian\nrefugees and their organizations expelled from Syria\nraises the very important question of where those\nrefugees should go. The natural and human answer\nsays that they should go back to their country,\nPalestine. They are more entitled to go back to their\nhomes than the million Russian Jews who were brought\nin by Israel during the last 10 years. They are also more\nentitled than another 1 million Jews that the head of the\nIsraeli Government plans to bring into Israel, although\nthey live well and securely in their countries. Although\nthe rulers of Israel claim that the Palestinians have no\nplace in their towns and villages and that the return of\nPalestinians threatens the existence of Israel, the truth\nis that the return of Palestinian refugees will alleviate\nracism in Israel and will not threaten its existence.\nDuring its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 Israel\nperpetrated the ugliest of crimes when it shelled and\nbesieged Beirut for over 80 days, during which time\nthousands of innocent Lebanese civilians were killed,\nthe infrastructure of Lebanon was destroyed and many\nhorrific massacres were perpetrated. Those massacres\nincluded the atrocities at Sabra and Shatila, which the\nentire world witnessed and is aware of.\nFaced with Israeli arrogance, the failure of the\ninternational community to stop Israel from\nperpetrating its crimes, and the provision of Israel with\nthe latest American warplanes and the most destructive\nand sophisticated weapons, the Lebanese people had no\nchoice but to stand fast and resist occupation. This\nresistance continued until it achieved its most\nimportant victory in May 2000, when it forced the\nIsraeli occupying forces to abandon most Lebanese\nterritories. No one in the world should forget that the\nbattles of the Lebanese resistance were fought on the\noccupied territories of Lebanon against occupying\nIsraeli soldiers and that this resistance did not act\nbeyond Lebanese borders and did not hurt Israeli\ncivilians during the 20 years of occupation, whereas\nthe occupying Israeli forces killed thousands of\nLebanese civilians, not to mention their repeated\ndestruction of hundreds of houses and much of the\nLebanese infrastructure.\nAfter all this, how could anyone fail to\ndistinguish between terrorism and resistance? Anyone\nwishing to target terrorism in our region must target\nIsraeli terrorism first and foremost, because what Israel\ndoes is the utmost form of terrorism; it is absolutely\nbereft of human compassion. There is no alternative\nbut to address the root causes of this terrorism once and\nfor all and uproot it from our modern life through the\nimplementation of international legitimacy in order to\nrestore rights, end injustice and occupation and grant\nthe Palestinian people the right to self-determination\nfreely and wholly.\nThese days mark the tenth anniversary of the\nconvening of the Madrid Peace Conference, for which\nwe made sincere efforts so it would create an opening\nfor a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nThe serious and purposeful negotiations that Syria has\nengaged in during recent years have shown two things\nto the international community: first, that Israel neither\ndesires nor is serious about achieving a just and\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with United\nNations resolutions; secondly, that Syria has the right\nto recover its territory in the Golan to the border of 4\nJune 1967, without compromise. However, we were\nalways faced with Israel\u2019s intransigence, denial of\nrights, evasion of the real issues and of the\nrequirements of peace. Indeed, Israel has done what its\nPrime Minister promised at the time: to make\nnegotiations go in circles for 10 years, with all the\ndangerous repercussions and tragic results that would\nproduce.\nThere is talk now about an opportunity for the\nresumption of the peace process according to the terms\n25\n\nof reference of the Madrid Conference. We believe that\nunless the two sponsors of the peace process, the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations, make a\nserious effort to implement the relevant United Nations\nresolutions, this opportunity will be wasted again, with\nall the dangerous repercussions that will hold for this\nimportant and sensitive region of the world.\nThe dialogue among civilizations has gained\nincreasing importance in the aftermath of the escalation\nof hostile attacks on certain cultures, religions and\nnationalities. Syria, which is the cradle of early\ncivilizations and a source of scientific and intellectual\nenlightenment, recognizes the importance of this\ndialogue and the necessity of pursuing it in the service\nof humanity and future generations. Our region, at its\npinnacle, was a lively example of dialogue and\ninteraction among civilizations. Within its broad\nhorizons, the civilizations of East and West met.\nIntellectuals, men of letters, scientists and philosophers\nfrom different parts of the world contributed to the\nformation of these civilizations. In this context we\nhope that the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\nCivilizations, recently adopted by the General\nAssembly, will be implemented. We find in this agenda\na horizon that responds to the aspirations of people\ntowards enriching the awareness of common human\nvalues among all peoples and deepening the spirit of\nunderstanding among them.\nIn conclusion, allow me to convey to you the\ngratitude of my country, Syria, and its President,\nGovernment and people for the precious trust and the\ngreat support that so many countries in the world\nexpressed when they elected the Syrian Arab Republic\nto the Security Council. I would like to assure you that\nSyria shall remain, as it has always been, in the\nforefront of those who defend international legitimacy\nand the Charter of the United Nations and will make\nevery possible effort during its membership on the\nSecurity Council to contribute to preserving\ninternational peace and security.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\ncome from the city of La Paz to add Bolivia\u2019s voice to\nthis universal support the United Nations has received\nthrough the Nobel Peace Prize. This award expresses\nbetter than all the speeches could possibly do the way\nin which the world appreciates the Organization and its\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. The mediating role\nperformed by the Organization, its calls to nations to\nagree among themselves, the courage it has in\nassuming risks and the willingness it has shown to\noffer lives for a cause go beyond the mere performance\nof a duty; they are an example to all our Governments.\nThe active role played by the Organization is more\nnecessary now than ever before.\nThis is a time in which the evil, malignant\nshadow of terror is rising on the horizon as the new\ncentury dawns. The Berlin Wall was the symbol of\nideological divisions during the second half of the\ntwentieth century. We must now, after 11 September,\ntear down the wall of terrorism and intolerance that a\nfew people wish to raise to divide the world.\nOn one side of this new wall are those of us who\nhave built up and believe in democracy with pluralism.\nOn the other side are those that wish despotically to\nimpose their beliefs, with no respect for the rule of law.\nOn one side of this new wall are those of us who\npermit and encourage the freedom of worship and\nexpression. On the other side are those that do not\npractice, permit or tolerate it. On one side of this wall\nare those of us who every day try to create equality of\nopportunities for all women. On the other side are\nthose that oppress and dominate them. On one side of\nthis wall are those of us who value freedom above all.\nOn the other side are the terrorists that wish to destroy\nand restrict it.\nLet there be no doubt that Bolivia will always be\non the side of democracy, freedom and tolerance. We\nwant a life in peace and harmony. This is why my\nGovernment, without any hesitation, with total\nconviction and in all forums, has expressed its full\nsupport for the measures undertaken by the coalition\nled by the United States Government after the attacks\nthat took the lives of thousands of innocent people, the\nmajority of whom were in this very city of New York.\nTerrorism is to a large extent incubated in and fed\nby the underground world of drug trafficking. We must\nnot accept that in attacking freedom, terrorism\ndisguises itself by putting forward political claims. We\ncannot accept that drug traffickers, seeking to\nundermine our democracies, drape themselves in the\nmantle of legitimate social demands. It is clear that\nterrorism and drug trafficking are Siamese twins and\nenemies of the free democracies. This is why we must\ncombat each of them with the same vigour and\ndetermination.\nBolivia, with all its limitations, is performing its\ntask in fighting drug trafficking. By the will of the\nmajority of the Bolivians, expressed through our own\nnational dialogue, guided by our own interests and\nencouraged by our own public opinion, we are\nirreversibly moving forward towards eradicating illegal\ncoca crops used to prepare cocaine and are entering\n13\n\ninto the final stage of the Dignity Plan, whose purpose\nis to remove Bolivia from the drug circuit.\nBut the work is not finished. International\nsolidarity and support are now more important than\never before. To complete the task, Bolivia needs\nsupport on two levels. First of all, the international\ncommunity must realize that sustained support for\nalternative development programmes is more necessary\nfor the countries that have eliminated the bulk of illegal\ncoca crops and cocaine, and in which many people\nhave been displaced as a result.\nBolivia has reduced more than 90 percent of its\nillegal coca leaf production. However obvious it may\nseem, this percentage must be repeated over and over,\nbecause many international bureaucracies allocate\nresources according to the size of the problem, which is\nmistakenly defined as the volume of production of coca\nleaves and cocaine, when the real economic problem\narises from the size of the reduction that has been\nachieved and the proportional reduction of the income\ngenerated by this activity. Bolivia deserves and needs\nmore support than ever before, because it has made\nmore progress than ever before.\nSecondly, and of more relevance now, it is\nnecessary to provide access to markets; the opportunity\nto fight for a place under the sun; and the right to work,\nproduce and sell. And here, at this point, the decision\nby the United States and the European Union to open\nup their markets to the products of alternative\ndevelopment takes on critical and definitive\nsignificance.\nBolivia is the least developed nation of South\nAmerica, the economy that is most open the region and\nthe only country that has achieved such a dramatic\nreduction in such a poisonous and harmful product as\ncocaine, within so short a time. For these three reasons,\nwe feel that we have every right to call for access to\nmarkets through free trade \u2014 triply free trade: free\nfrom tariffs, free from subsidies and free from non-\ntariff measures.\nWe need free trade, the triply free trade that\napplies to sectors such as telecommunications,\nbanking, computers and turbines, must also apply to\nagriculture, textiles and leather. Unfortunately, these\nlast three labour-intensive sectors are governed by\nnineteenth-century rules in the midst of the third\nmillennium.\nIn Bolivia we are moving forward with\ndecentralized and participatory programmes on health\nand education. An educated and vaccinated citizen who\ndoes not have a market, however, is not a full-fledged\ncitizen of the present-day world of ours. In Bolivia we\nhave straightened out and opened up our economy, but\nwe have not seen full reciprocity in the developed\nworld or on the part of our neighbours.\nIn Bolivia we have almost entirely eliminated the\nproduction of cocaine, which however harmful it might\nbe, was an export product that was not subject to\nsubsidies, barriers or tariffs. This is why we require\naccess to markets to guarantee the completion of the\nDignity Plan and avoid frustrating the will of our\ncitizens, who have assumed the challenge of moving\nfrom illegal activities to legitimate work, without,\nhowever, having achieved the same access to the\nmarket.\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, in\nthe midst of a severe economic and political crisis that\naffects all the countries of the region, Bolivia is facing\nanother challenge that can decisively change its future.\nIn the few years since the work on the most important\ngas pipeline of South America was completed,\nBolivia\u2019s natural gas reserves grew exponentially, and\nhave made my country a significant player in the\nhemisphere-wide market. We are now serving a\ngrowing part of the energy demands of Brazil, and we\nfirmly intend to go on from here to reach the markets\nof the Pacific, Mexico and the United States.\nThe tragic events of 11 September saw to it that\nenergy and gas integration must be based on a long-\nterm vision that takes into account three elements:\nextensive gas reserves, a reliable economy and a solid\ndemocracy. Bolivia has these three elements. The\nprojects that are now being studied and negotiated will\ntransform the productive structure of my country,\npropel the growth rates, reinforce our role as a hub and\nthe environmentally clean heart of the continent, while\nexpanding our role and presence on the Pacific.\nBolivia will thus take another step on the march\nthat it began more than 120 years ago to return to the\nsea of our ancestors.\nBolivia thus will reassert its unflinching\ndetermination to regain its status as a maritime nation,\nsomething with which we were born into independent\nlife.\n14\n\nBolivia supports the struggle against terrorism\nand for freedom. My country, more than any other\ncountry, is making a gigantic effort to fight the ally of\nterrorism \u2014 that is, drug trafficking. Given this effort,\ngiven our determination to be open, and given the need\nto fight poverty, my country calls for access to markets.\nBolivia will play a central role in working\ntowards reliable gas and energy integration in the\ntwenty-first century.\nFinally, we realize that the long struggle for\nfreedom and the fight against terrorism is just\nbeginning and will end only when all the citizens of the\nworld, men and women alike, will be entitled to vote,\nto elect, to offer their opinions and to profess their\nfaith, to move about freely and, above all, to live free\nfrom fear and terror. The United Nations must be the\nplace where the world comes together to walk down\nthis shared path. And together we will build this road\ntowards integration and peace, as these times demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Danish Government\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium on behalf of\nthe European Union.\nOn 11 September a brutal blow was delivered to\nthe people of the United States of America. At the\nsame time, it was a strike against the foundations of the\nUnited Nations and against its mission to secure peace\nand prosperity for mankind in a spirit of collaboration\nand shared values. Extremists have seen fit to take the\nlives of thousands of innocent people to press their\nmessage. The Danish people have reacted with outrage\nand sorrow. We strongly condemn the criminal and\ncowardly act; our thoughts and our compassion are\nwith the victims, their families and their friends.\nThis year the Nobel Peace Prize went to the\nSecretary-General and to the United Nations. May I\ncongratulate both the Secretary-General and the United\nNations and its staff. The choice could not have been\nbetter or the timing more acute.\nThe horrific terrorist attack on the United States\nchanged the agenda of the General Assembly. From the\noutset, the international community has demonstrated\nits resolve to confront the menace of terrorism. The\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council have\npassed resolutions unanimously condemning in the\nstrongest terms the terrorist attacks, and countries and\nother international organizations have followed with a\nhost of other initiatives to that end. The international\ncommunity has stood up to the challenge united.\nDenmark welcomes the broad coalition of\ncountries that has rallied behind the United States\nresponse to the terrorist attacks in order to effectively\nbring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and\nsponsors of international terrorism.\nBy acting together, by acting resolutely, by\nredoubling our efforts, we will stop the terror. At the\ninternational level, we need the United Nations to\nprovide the norms and the international legal\nframework required to define and criminalize acts of\nterror. The United Nations has already put important\nparts of the legal machinery in place with the 12\nexisting conventions aimed at combating specific forms\nof terror. Furthermore, work is well under way towards\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nAt the national level, countries must urgently take\nconcrete steps to implement Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). States must have national\nlegislation in place in order to prosecute persons\nsupporting or committing acts of terrorism. At the same\ntime, countries must be ready to take steps to preclude\nin all possible ways the operation and financing of\nterrorist networks within their territories. All countries\nshould accede to and enforce the 12 conventions\nagainst international terrorism and should ensure\nprompt follow-up of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nThree weeks ago, the Danish Government\nsubmitted a draft bill on national follow-up in our\nParliament, and I can assure the Assembly that\nDenmark will do its utmost to cooperate with the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to\nresolution 1373 (2001).\nThese measures form part of our overall efforts to\ncreate a better world, in which human dignity is\nguaranteed and human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms are fully respected. Indeed, recent events\nunderscore further the need to make the world a better\nplace, in particular for those vast groups of people who\nlive in poverty. For poor people who see no possibility\nof improving their economic and social standing,\nturning to extremist religious and ideological views\nand networks may be tempting. We need to secure real\npolitical, economic and social opportunities for the\nworld\u2019s poor and disadvantaged.\nThe goals identified by world leaders during the\nMillennium Summit give our work direction in the\ndecades to come.\n35\n\nArmed conflicts cause inconceivable human\nsuffering and material destruction and are often the\nmain obstacles to development. An effective response\nto present-day conflicts requires a long-term political\ncommitment from a united international community in\nthe form of a diplomatic, political, economic, military\nand civil engagement. The United Nations is the\ninternational body vested with a universal mandate to\nsecure support for conflict prevention. Often, it is also\nthe only body capable of legitimate conflict\nmanagement. Thus many people around the world are\ndependent on the effective and prompt reaction of the\nUnited Nations.\nFortunately, we have in recent years witnessed\nquite a number of successful United Nations\noperations. Let me single out three examples, in three\ndifferent parts of the world.\nFirst, in East Timor the United Nations presence\nhas furthered political progress towards the building of\na new nation State, set for May next year.\nSecondly, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia\nand Eritrea has demonstrated the readiness of the\ninternational community to resolve conflicts and has\nstrengthened the credibility of United Nations\npeacekeeping in Africa. That Mission also marked the\nfirst and successful deployment of the Multinational\nUnited Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness\nBrigade (SHIRBRIG).\nThirdly, the day after tomorrow is an important\nmilestone for the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo and for the people\nof Kosovo. Hopefully, the latter will participate in\ngreat numbers in the elections. The Danish\nGovernment has noted with satisfaction that both the\nSerbian and the Yugoslav Governments have endorsed\nKosovo Serb participation in the elections.\nHowever, other conflicts, not least in Africa,\ncontinue to cause tremendous suffering to the people\naffected and to challenge the international community.\nThe prevention and management of violent conflicts\nhave therefore become an integral part of Denmark\u2019s\ncomprehensive engagement in developing countries.\nThe United Nations has a unique role to play in\nhelping Afghanistan to rebuild itself and to re-enter the\ninternational community. Denmark strongly supports\nthe work of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General, Ambassador Brahimi. We are ready\nto contribute further to the ongoing relief and\nhumanitarian efforts, as well as to the immense task\nthat lies ahead: reconstructing Afghanistan.\nA conflict of particular concern is that in the\nMiddle East, which threatens to escalate beyond\ncontrol. The Mitchell report and the Tenet Plan still\nprovide important windows of opportunity. The United\nNations, the European Union, the United States and\nneighbouring States must redouble their efforts to get\nthe parties to take immediate action to stop the\nviolence and to create the atmosphere necessary to\nrestart negotiations.\nThe Millennium development goals provide the\nframework for each and every country to act in a\nconcerted fashion on a range of key development\nchallenges.\nIn this connection, I should like to refer to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s road map for the implementation\nof the Millennium Summit Declaration, in which he\nstated that we have just emerged from an era of\ncommitment and stressed that we must now enter an\nera of implementation. This timely reminder has our\nfull support.\nThe last 10 years have seen more countries than\never before commit themselves to a democratic and\naccountable political system. This trend is encouraging.\nOpen societies committed to democracy are more\nlikely to respect the rule of law, human rights and\nfundamental freedoms and to foster accountable\ngovernments. National responsibilities for\ndevelopment, as expressed through good governance\nand the promotion of human rights and democracy, are\nkey to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and essential\ntools for economic development. The New Partnership\nfor Africa\u2019s Development is an encouraging step in this\ndirection.\nIn building on these positive trends, we must go\neven further. We must take concerted steps forward on\na whole range of key issues, from security, human\nrights and trade to development.\nIn this regard, our planning prior to 11 September\nis now showing unexpected rewards. The World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha,\nthe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment in Monterrey, and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg are all part\nof the same, global process. They are a unique\n36\n\nopportunity for us to show that multilateral cooperation\nin the economic field can make a difference and that\nwe can achieve globalization with a human face.\nOur primary target is clearly to eradicate poverty.\nThis objective should be at the heart of the\ninternational effort in the coming weeks and months.\nWe need a \u201cGlobal Deal\u201d that encompasses all human\nbeings, with the aim of achieving long-term sustainable\ndevelopment, based on global coherence between\neconomic, social and environmental policies.\nThus, we need partnerships between developed\nand developing countries; between all development\nactors, including the wider United Nations family,\ncomprising the WTO, the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and drawing upon\ncivil society and the private sector. All partners need to\nbe on board to achieve a balance between national,\ninternational and systemic endeavours.\nThe Financing for Development Conference in\nMexico, to be held in March 2002, is a first and\nimportant opportunity to demonstrate our new resolve\non development. We could leave Monterrey with\nimportant elements of a global framework that would\nhelp us pull an unprecedented number of people out of\npoverty over the coming 15 years. The human and\nsecurity benefits at stake are compelling.\nWe face a great responsibility in the days, weeks\nand months ahead. Both developed and developing\ncountries need to set their priorities straight in order to\nstrike this Global Deal. In that sense, a global\ncommitment to realizing the national potential for\ndevelopment of the developing countries should be\nmet, in the spirit of partnership, by the developed\ncountries, with full support for reaching these goals.\nWe also reiterate the call on the industrialized\ncountries to grant more generous development\nassistance and to increase their official development\nassistance so that, as a minimum, it reaches the\nestablished United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\ngross domestic product that is necessary to achieve the\nMillennium goals.\nRecent events have demonstrated that\ninternational cooperation is indispensable. The United\nNations is the right forum for dealing with many of\nthese challenges. Let us equip the Organization to meet\nthem effectively. By closing a Global Deal, we can take\ndevelopment forward on the broad front.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe President has been\nelected to chair at what is undoubtedly one of the most\nchallenging sessions of the General Assembly in recent\ntimes. My delegation congratulates him on his election.\nWe pledge our full support to him and express our\nconfidence that under his leadership the work of the\nAssembly will have a positive impact on our collective\nefforts to meet the many challenges facing our world.\nMy delegation would also like to take this\nopportunity to commend his predecessor, Mr. Harri\nHolkeri of Finland, for his leadership as President of\nthe fifty-fifth session, the Millennium Assembly.\nWe are in times of great tragedy but also of\nlaudable triumphs. The Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations have rendered outstanding and\ninspiring service to the world\u2019s peoples. Mr. Secretary-\nGeneral, we celebrate with you and this Organization\nthe well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to you,\neven as we express our appreciation for the exemplary\nleadership that you continue to provide to the United\nNations.\nMy delegation also wishes to take this\nopportunity to express its sincere sympathy to the\nGovernments of the United States and the Dominican\nRepublic and to the families of those who lost their\nlives in the crash of a United States commercial aircraft\nin New York yesterday.\nWhile recognizing the many challenges the global\ncommunity will face in the twenty-first century, leaders\nat last year\u2019s Millennium Assembly nonetheless were\noptimistic that peace and prosperity would be\nimportant hallmarks of the new century. Their hopes\nhave been severely undermined by the indefensible acts\nof terrorism perpetrated in the United States on 11\nSeptember 2001. The horrific scenes of death and\ndestruction in New York, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania, so indelibly etched in our minds, have\nno doubt changed the world forever. The Government\nand the people of the Bahamas mourned with countries\nall over the world, including our sister Caribbean\ncountries that lost loved ones, and expressed our\nsadness at the senseless loss of life and wanton\ndestruction of property.\nEven as events in Afghanistan unfold, the United\nNations, and indeed the world, now face a dilemma:\nhow to confront the grave challenge which\ninternational terrorism has defiantly issued to the world\nand at the same time meet the Charter obligations to\n30\n\npromote human rights and social progress and better\nstandards of life in larger freedom. We must be\nvisionary and creative in ensuring that the resources\nand energies of the United Nations and of the\ninternational community are used to implement a\nbalanced agenda that will deal effectively and\nresolutely with terrorists and terrorism and that will\nalso continue to have a positive impact on human\nrights, economic and social development and other\ncommon objectives.\nThe international community has spoken with one\nvoice in condemning international terrorism as a major\ndestabilizing force in the world. The acts of 11\nSeptember 2001 fundamentally shifted security\nconcerns regarding terrorists and terrorism to the\nworkplace, streets and homes of innocent people,\ncreating anxiety, insecurity and uncertainty worldwide.\nSignificantly, the terrorist acts have had serious and\ndamaging consequences on a rapidly globalizing world\neconomy. The economies of both industrialized and\ndeveloping countries have been severely disrupted,\nwith grave implications for future economic and\nfinancial stability. The economic outlook, particularly\nfor many developing countries, is indeed grim. The\nsmall economies of the countries in the Caribbean have\nexperienced massive disruption because of their\nvulnerability to external shocks and heavy dependence\non tourism, especially from the North American\nmarket. There has been significant loss of employment\nin the tourism, financial services and related sectors,\neven as government revenues have fallen and foreign\nreserves are threatened.\nThe countries of the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) have moved decisively to assess the\nimplications of the terrorist attacks on its member\nStates. As Chair of the Conference of Heads of\nGovernment of CARICOM, the Bahamas was host to a\nspecial emergency meeting of the Conference, held on\n11 and 12 October 2001, which adopted the Nassau\nDeclaration on International Terrorism. That\nDeclaration sets out the action that Governments would\ntake to mitigate the impact on the region\u2019s tourism,\naviation, financial services and agricultural sectors,\nwhich are the major contributors to the gross national\nproduct, foreign exchange earnings and employment in\nthe countries of our region.\nCARICOM heads of Government also\nunequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and\nreaffirmed their commitment to work with the\ninternational community in the multifaceted fight\nagainst terrorism, in accordance with international law\nand conventions. It is therefore our hope that the\ninternational community will support the countries of\nCARICOM during this difficult and challenging period.\nWe in the Bahamas have taken our obligation to\ncooperate in the fight against terrorism very seriously.\nWe have complied with Security Council resolutions,\nincluding resolution 1333 (2000) which calls for the\nfreezing of funds and other financial assets of Osama\nbin Laden, the Al Qaeda organization and individuals\nassociated with it. The International Obligations,\nEconomic and Ancillary Measures Order 2001, enacted\nin our Parliament in September this year, prohibits any\nperson dealing with any property and any financial\ninstitution licensed in the Bahamas from transacting\nbusiness with Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda or any\nindividuals or entities associated with them, who, for\nthese purposes, may be designated from time to time.\nWe have been able to take such timely action because\nof a comprehensive legislative regime enacted in\nDecember 2000 which put in place an effective\nregulatory regime to ensure that the Bahamas financial\nservices sector is not abused by criminals for money-\nlaundering or any other financial crimes. It was the\nenactment of that legislation that resulted in the\nFinancial Action Task Force\u2019s removal of the Bahamas,\nin June of this year, from its list of non-cooperative\njurisdictions in the fight against money-laundering. As\npart of its overall review of the international regime for\naction against terrorists and terrorism, in October this\nyear my Government signed the United Nations\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism. We are following very closely the\ndiscussions on a comprehensive convention against\nterrorism, in order to determine what further action the\nGovernment will need to take in this area. We hope that\na comprehensive, practical and implementable\ninstrument will be adopted that will take into account\nthe existing anti-terrorism regime. In this we see a\nclearly delineated role for the United Nations, and\nparticularly the Security Council, which is well placed\nto articulate a coherent policy for global cooperation in\nthe fight against international terrorism.\nMeeting our obligations, however, has not been\nwithout sacrifice. The Bahamas, like many other\nCaribbean countries, has been obliged to divert scarce\nresources from other critical development objectives to\ninitiate the sweeping security changes required at our\n31\n\nairports and seaports and otherwise to mitigate the\nimpact of the 11 September events.\nFor the Government and people of the Bahamas,\nthe ravages of hurricane Michelle have further\ncompounded the significant economic setbacks caused\nby the 11 September events in the United States. Just\nlast week, that hurricane made a direct hit on our\narchipelagic State, causing extensive damage to\ninfrastructure, agriculture and vegetation in some of\nour major islands. The Government is still determining\nthe extent of the damage but has already begun the\nessential period of reconstruction.\nGlobalization and trade liberalization are, and\nmust remain, central issues on the world\u2019s agenda.\nGenerally, globalization has presented significant\nopportunities and has had a positive impact on many\ncountries. However, for others, particularly in the\ndeveloping world, the freer flow of capital, technology,\nfinance, goods and services across national\nboundaries \u2014 which is the essence of globalization \u2014\nhas not met the stated objectives of improving overall\neconomic prosperity, reducing poverty and closing the\ntechnological gap. On the contrary, the social costs of\nglobalization \u2014 poverty, inequality and\nunemployment \u2014 remain serious challenges for many\nof the countries of the developing world. These\nchallenges are further compounded by factors including\nan onerous debt burden, a limited or inadequate export\ninfrastructure to effectively participate in the global\ntrading system, and an inability to access the markets\nof the developed world. My Government, nevertheless,\nis cognizant that the international trading regime of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides a\nsignificant framework within which countries may\nbenefit from globalization and trade liberalization, and\nwork towards appropriately addressing the costs and\nrisks associated with the global trading system. In July\nthis year, the Bahamas submitted its application for\naccession to the WTO, for WTO membership is a\npriority for my Government and we hope that our\napplication will receive the requisite support.\nWe are in a period, leading up to late 2002,\nduring which the United Nations is defining its\neconomic and social development agenda with greater\nprecision, through a series of assessments of\ninternational action in specific areas. The Bahamas was\npleased to have participated in the Organization\u2019s\nreview of its work and setting of its agenda for further\naction in the areas of racism, racial discrimination and\nhuman settlements and the illicit trade in small arms\nand light weapons. My Government believes that every\neffort should be made to consolidate those areas in\nwhich progress was made at the World Conference\nagainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\nand Related Intolerance that took place in Durban,\nSouth Africa, from 31 August to 8 September this year.\nGlobal objectives in respect of human settlements\nreceived considerable impetus from the special session\non human settlements that took place in New York in\nJune 2001. The Declaration on Cities and Other Human\nSettlements in the New Millennium, adopted by the\nConference, should prove invaluable in addressing\nchronic problems of inadequate shelter.\nThe United Nations Conference on the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects addressed a problem that for the small\ncountries of the Caribbean is a particularly serious one.\nWe wished the Conference could have been more\nforthright in its adoption of measures to better address\nthese critical issues but readily accept the Programme\nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects as an essential first step. Decisions taken at\nthese and other United Nations meetings are indeed\ndecisions of the Organization that the Bahamas hopes\nwill be implemented as such by all Member States.\nFew countries in the world, if any, have been\nspared the vagaries of HIV/AIDS. The statistics are\ncompelling \u2014 more than 30 million people affected.\nWith respect to the developing world they are even\nmore compelling \u2014 more than 95 per cent of those\naffected live in the developing world. The Caribbean\nregion has not been spared, but we are taking decisive\naction. Our Pan-Caribbean Partnership launched in\nFebruary this year has the full support and commitment\nof heads of Government for effective action against\nHIV/AIDS in the wider Caribbean region. The\nGovernment of the Bahamas in this regard welcomes\nthe contribution of the Government of Canada to the\nCaribbean HIV/AIDS programme. The special session\non HIV/AIDS held in New York in June 2001 gave\nheads of State and Government the opportunity to set\nan agenda for slowing and reversing the destructive\nimpact of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. It is an\nagenda that must be implemented to halt and reverse\nthis tragedy that is devastating populations and\n32\n\nthreatening to reverse the development gains made in\nmany developing countries. The developing world will,\nand must, look for help and support to those having the\ntechnology, research capacity and resources by which\nthey themselves have been able to control the spread of\nthis deadly disease.\nThe year 2002 will also be an active one, both for\nUnited Nations benchmark assessments and\nreadjustment of priorities and for addressing significant\nissues on the international agenda. The International\nConference on Financing for Development will be\nconvened in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. As\nplans develop, we hope that all Members of the United\nNations will come to appreciate the need to ensure that\nthe Conference provides the framework within which\ncommitments can be made so that technical assistance\ncan be provided to poor countries for basic\ninfrastructural development, the standards of people\nworldwide who live in endemic poverty can be raised,\ndeveloping countries can be assisted to attract foreign\ndirect investment, and information technology can be\nmore freely transferred to developing countries. My\nGovernment, for its part, is of the view that small,\ndeveloping, middle-income countries such as the\nBahamas, because of their economic and ecological\nvulnerabilities, should not be excluded from\ndevelopment financing. It is also the view of my\nGovernment that the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be convened in South Africa in\nSeptember 2002, should be complementary to\nundertakings made at the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development. Ten years after the Rio\nSummit of 1992, the ever-increasing fury of natural\ndisasters, climate change and sea-level rise, and the\ndepletion of biological resources and overall\nenvironmental degradation, are but some of the issues\nbegging reassessment that must be part of the blueprint\nfor determined action emanating from South Africa.\nLikewise, the Bahamas hopes that the Second World\nAssembly on Ageing, to be held in Madrid, Spain, in\n2002, and the special session of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly on children, postponed to 2002,\nshould assess progress but, more importantly, must\nemphasize action that will provide guidance for\nnational, regional and international policy and planning\nin their respective areas.\nThe initiatives the United Nations will take up in\n2002 to review and assess progress in a significant\nnumber of areas should bring clearly into focus the\nactions that must be taken by Member States and by the\nOrganization to accomplish agreed economic and\nsocial objectives. It is the hope of the Bahamas that\nthese reviews will be followed by a period of intense\nimplementation of decisions that have been agreed, so\nthat qualitative and quantitative improvements may be\nrealized in all areas. We believe that such\nimprovements are essential but must be in concert with\nUnited Nations initiatives to meet demands in other\ncritical areas, such as conflict resolution, war, and\nhumanitarian crises worldwide. They should also be in\nconcert with the Organization\u2019s efforts to address\neffectively and comprehensively issues such as the\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances, the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons, alien smuggling and refugee flows, which do\nnot respect national boundaries. In all such cases, the\ndanger of inaction could have dire consequences,\nparticularly for international peace and security.\nIn conclusion, the current preoccupation with\nterrorism has fortunately not paralysed the United\nNations. What it has done is to emphasize the need for\nan effective and cohesive United Nations, capable of\nresponding flexibly to unexpected and contradictory\nevents in a timely and effective manner with little or no\ndisruption of its programmes in other areas. We believe\nthat the United Nations Charter constitutes a viable and\nfirm foundation for the Organization to balance and\nachieve its objectives, to maintain international peace\nand security and promote economic and social\nprogress. The Bahamas fully supports the United\nNations in all its endeavours.\n\n"

To the\nGovernment of the United States, our host city and all\nthe bereaved families, I address the condolences of the\nGovernment and people of Guinea.\nA year ago in this Hall, the great leaders of the\nworld, in a unanimous surge, committed themselves to\nthinking together about the role of this Organization,\nthe United Nations, in the twenty-first century, and\nabout ways of achieving its objectives fully, with a\nview to constructing together a world of peace,\nprogress and solidarity. The historic Declaration which\nemerged from the Millennium Summit emphasized the\nneed to open a new era of international relations.\nIt was when the international community was\npreparing to review the implementation of the\nrecommendations and decisions of that Summit that\nunprecedented terrorist acts cast a shadow over our\nhopes. These acts, to which the United States fell\nvictim on 11 September 2001, profoundly shocked the\nconscience of all peoples. The barbarity and violence\nof these terrorist attacks, and also the threat of\nbioterrorism, are serious attacks on international peace\nand security.\nMy delegation would like once again to express\nits sympathy to the American people, especially the\nfamilies of the many victims. The Republic of Guinea\ncondemns those intolerable acts and believes that it\nshould be the concern of all States to combat and\neradicate terrorism. We firmly support any measures\naimed at eliminating the bases of international\nterrorism and fully associate ourselves with the\ninternational community in its global response to that\nscourge.\nThe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\nis thus taking place within the context of a new and\nalarming situation for international peace and security.\nMy delegation is therefore very pleased to see you, Sir,\npresiding over the Assembly during this session. We\nare convinced that your wealth of experience, as well\nas your great diplomatic skill, will ensure the success\nof our discussions. I would like to assure you of the\ncooperation and support of the delegation of Guinea.\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the excellent work accomplished\nunder his presidency.\n17\n\nMy delegation would like once again to convey\nthe warm congratulations of General Lansana Cont\u00e9,\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, to our brother,\nKofi Annan, on his well-deserved re-election as the\nhead of our Organization. The unanimous tribute that\nhas been paid to him brings honour to the whole of the\nAfrican continent and bears witness to his great\nqualities and his commitment to achieving the\nobjectives of the United Nations. The Nobel Peace\nPrize recently awarded jointly to him and to the\nOrganization is eloquent testimony to that commitment\nand an encouragement to continue to act in the service\nof peace and understanding among peoples.\nThe award of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize to the\nUnited Nations is, without doubt, a recognition of its\nrole in the implementation of its objectives \u2014 the\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\ndevelopment and cooperation among nations.\nIncreasingly, the Organization is proving to be the\nnecessary crucible for dialogue among States.\nHowever, almost all Members earnestly desire the\nstrengthening and improvement of the entire system.\nWhile reaffirming its support for the reform\nprocess initiated by the Secretary-General, my country,\nthe Republic of Guinea, would like to emphasize the\nneed to strengthen the principal organs of the\nOrganization. We welcome the actions taken by your\npredecessor, Sir, to streamline the working methods of\nthe General Assembly so as to give it fresh dynamism.\nWe hope that that impetus will continue.\nMy delegation would also like to reaffirm its\nsupport for restructuring the Security Council, in its\nmembership as well as its working methods, so as to\nenable it to better protect the interests of all Member\nStates. I should like to take this opportunity to express,\non behalf of my Government, our gratitude to all States\nfor the unanimous support that enabled Guinea to be\nelected a non-permanent member of the Security\nCouncil for 2002 and 2003. During its mandate, the\nRepublic of Guinea will make every effort to contribute\nactively to the maintenance of peace and security in the\nworld.\nPeace and security continue to be threatened in\nmany parts of the world. In the Middle East,\nintolerance and intransigence have led to a dangerous\nescalation of violence, which, if not controlled in time,\ncould cause the whole region to go up in flames. The\nRepublic of Guinea would like to appeal to all the\nparties to exercise greater restraint so as to facilitate a\nresumption of the peace process. My country supports\nthe full application of the recommendations of the\nMitchell commission and the implementation of\neffective follow-up mechanisms. Dispatching\ninternational observers could contribute to ending the\nviolence and returning peace to all the peoples there.\nHowever, the indifference of the international\ncommunity and its failure to take action could, in the\nlong term, prove to be prejudicial to security in the\nMiddle East.\nMy delegation condemns all acts of violence,\nwhich can lead only to a worsening of the situation. In\nthe light of the serious events that have taken place in\nrecent months, the international community must do all\nthat it can to lead all parties to accept a ceasefire and to\nresume the peace process. Arms must give way to\ndialogue, which should lead to a just, equitable and\nlasting peace. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian\npeople should be respected. Likewise, the existence\nand security of Israel must be guaranteed.\nOne year ago, my country became the victim of\naggression committed by rebel groups. That barbaric\naggression caused great loss of life and material\ndamage. My Government would like to express its full\nappreciation for the subsequent role played by the\nUnited Nations in adopting appropriate measures to\ncreate conditions conducive to the restoration of peace\nand stability in the subregion. My delegation would\nalso like to take this opportunity to thank all the\nindividuals and States that contributed to the adoption\nand implementation of those measures. One year later,\nthe fact that a dialogue has been initiated by civil\nsociety in the three countries concerned \u2014 Sierra\nLeone, Liberia and Guinea \u2014 means that we have\nreached an important stage in the search for peace.\nThe Republic of Guinea, which has always shown\nits determination to maintain and strengthen friendship,\nbrotherhood and cooperation with all African countries\nin general and neighbouring countries in particular,\nwould like to reaffirm to the Assembly its readiness to\nmake the Mano River Union a model of economic\nintegration, social cohesion and political stability.\nHowever, relaunching the activities of the Union\nwill depend upon respect for the relevant provisions of\nthe Non-aggression and Security Cooperation Treaty\nsigned by the three countries and of the 15th Protocol\nto the Mano River Declaration, signed at Conakry on 8\n18\n\nMay 2000. That is what is required for productive\ndialogue among the three countries.\nIn the framework of the process of re-establishing\nconfidence and dialogue among the countries members\nof the Mano River Union, meetings have been held at\nthe ministerial level in Monrovia, Freetown and\nConakry. Those meetings made it possible to discuss\nimportant problems relating to the activities of armed\ngroups in the subregion, the situation of refugees,\nmeasures to rebuild confidence, peace and security, and\nthe need to reactivate the various bodies of the Mano\nRiver Union.\nMy Government welcomes the encouraging\ndevelopments in Sierra Leone, particularly the\nprogramme for disarmament, demobilization and\nreintegration (DDR). The DDR programme that has\nbeen implemented will have to be consolidated if it is\nto lead to the true demobilization of all the\nRevolutionary United Front combatants and if the\nmistakes made in Liberia are to be avoided. In Liberia,\nthe restoration of peace after 10 years of civil war has\nnot, unfortunately, been accompanied by a true DDR\nprogramme or by post-conflict financial support.\nI would like to express regret with regard to the\ninadequate results of the Paris conference convened to\ndeal with the problem of Sierra Leone, and to call on\nthe international community to provide the necessary\nmaterial and financial support to guarantee lasting\npeace in that country. My delegation bases its appeal\non the relevant recommendations contained in the\nBrahimi report, which have been accepted by the\nprincipal organs of the Organization. The Republic of\nGuinea will continue to support the efforts of the\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States in restoring peace, security and national\nreconciliation in Sierra Leone.\nThe question of refugees is still a matter of great\nconcern for my Government. The enormous economic,\nsocial, environmental and security impact of the\ncontinued presence of hundreds of thousands of Sierra\nLeonean and Liberian refugees continues to impose a\nheavy burden on the economic and social life of my\ncountry. The situation of the refugees is a matter of\ngreat concern for the international community at a time\nwhen rebel attacks against my country are being\ncarried out, as the countries hosting refugees are the\nmain target of the aggressors. Following this\naggression, the Government took appropriate measures,\nin cooperation with the Office of the United Nations\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, to relocate refugees\nin zones far from the borders in order to ensure their\nsecurity.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s report on strengthening\nof the coordination of emergency humanitarian\nassistance amply describes the context of humanitarian\nassistance and the difficulties to be overcome,\nparticularly in complex emergency situations.\nWe welcome the missions undertaken in the\nsubregion of West Africa by various United Nations\nbodies, as well as the conclusions they reached. While\nthe resolution of most issues identified by those\nmissions requires an integrated approach, it is\nnonetheless true that problems peculiar to certain\ncountries require particular attention. With respect to\nGuinea, a victim of the consequences of the conflicts in\nthe subregion, it would be desirable for the\ninternational community to provide greater support. In\nthat regard, I wish to reiterate the appeal to convene a\nconference on solidarity with Guinea in order to help it\naddress the consequences of the prolonged presence of\nrefugees on its territory. I would stress that this appeal\nof the Guinean Government is supported by the United\nNations inter-agency mission that recently visited our\ncountry.\nBefore I conclude on this topic, I wish to\nwelcome the proposal to create a United Nations office\nfor West Africa, in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the Fall mission report. The\ncreation of such a body would demonstrate the\nOrganization\u2019s clear interest in making the West\nAfrican region a zone of peace, security and\ncooperation. My country will spare no effort in\ncooperating fully with that office.\nHow can we discuss the conflicts in Africa\nwithout highlighting the links between the illegal\nexploitation of natural resources, the traffic in weapons\nand the perpetuation of conflict? The reports of the\nvarious groups of experts established by the Security\nCouncil are edifying on this subject. In Sierra Leone,\nAngola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nthese links have clearly shown the involvement, in\naddition to rebel groups, of certain authorities in that\nillegal activity.\nMy Government therefore fully supports the\nactions of the Security Council to impose sanctions\nagainst any Government or group involved in the\n19\n\npillaging of a country\u2019s natural resources, in\naccordance with the relevant provisions of international\nlaw. The Republic of Guinea feels that if energetic\ndeterrent measures are not taken against the\nperpetrators of such crimes, which are emerging as a\nnew kind of threat to peace, the entire African\ncontinent may once again fall victim to conflict.\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, my country calls for scrupulous respect for the\nLusaka Agreement and for all pertinent Security\nCouncil resolutions, and in particular for the\nwithdrawal of foreign troops, safeguarding the integrity\nof Congolese territory and the pursuit of the inter-\nCongolese dialogue.\nIn the Western Sahara, my country welcomes the\nefforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General.\nWe are following with great interest the new initiatives\nunder way to find an acceptable solution to the crisis.\nThe phenomenon of globalization, characteristic\nof international life today, calls for greater attention\nfrom our States. My delegation is aware of the\nnecessary interdependence of nations and wishes once\nagain to stress that there can be no shared destiny\nwithout a minimum of justice and solidarity in\ninternational relations. We must work together to make\ninternational economic relations more human and to\neradicate poverty.\nThere is no need here to point out that poverty,\ndestitution and illiteracy, which are unfortunately the\nlot of a large majority of nations, provide fertile ground\nfor the propagation of the extremism and fanaticism\nthat, regrettably, underlie terrorist tendencies\nthroughout the world. The eradication of poverty\nshould be the objective of all countries in strengthening\nthe bases of lasting peace and security in the world.\nAllow me to reiterate the appeal to the rich\ncountries to listen more closely to the poorer nations\nand to support them in their development efforts. In\nthis respect, I renew the appeal for the adoption of a\nbetter approach to the question of the debt of African\ncountries, for appropriate payment for raw materials\nand for an increase in official development assistance.\nOn another level, the Marrakesh Agreement\nestablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO)\nsought to institute an equitable multilateral trade\nsystem with special reference to the particular situation\nof the least developed countries. It is regrettable to note\ntoday, however, that the least developed countries are\nbeing increasingly marginalized in the globalization\nprocess and that their share of the world trade market is\nonly 0.4 per cent.\nThe Republic of Guinea hopes that this trend will\nbe reversed and that decisions to that end will be taken\nat the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha.\nThese decisions will have to address, inter alia, the\nissue of the implementation of WTO accords, the\nconsolidation of special and differentiated treatment set\nforth in the various WTO agreements, consolidated\nmarket access for the products of the least developed\ncountries to the markets of the developed countries,\nand access to essential drugs for the poorest\npopulations of the world that are particularly\nvulnerable to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. I\nalso welcome the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s\naccession to full membership of the WTO and reiterate\nthe support of the Guinean Government for the position\npositing a single China.\nIn addition, we would like to see the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nin March in Mexico, become an opportunity for all\nparties to agree on solutions promoting sustainable\ndevelopment for all members of the international\ncommunity, in particular the developing countries and\nespecially those on the African continent.\nIn stressing the interdependence of\nenvironmental, economic and social factors, my\ndelegation feels that the forthcoming World Summit on\nSustainable Development, to be held in South Africa,\nshould encourage the financing of projects. My\ndelegation urges greater involvement by the\ninternational financial institutions in the search for\nways to promote international cooperation for\ndevelopment. In the framework of operational activities\nfor development, the funds and programmes of the\nUnited Nations must more than ever harmonize and\nstress their interaction on the African continent so as to\nallow it to rise above conflict and underdevelopment.\nI also take this opportunity to appeal to the\ninternational community to give special attention to the\nNew African Initiative, adopted at the recent Assembly\nof Heads of State and Government of the Organization\nof African Unity, held in Lusaka in July, in order to\nhelp Africa to participate actively in the world\neconomy and international political life and thus to\n20\n\nescape exclusion from a planet undergoing full-scale\nglobalization.\nThe United Nations was born last century. It\ncontinues to exist in this new century. This is a source\nof satisfaction to humanity. It is therefore essential that\nwe return to the ideals on which the Organization was\nfounded and that we give it the means to achieve a\nworld of peace, progress, solidarity and concord. The\nachievement of such a world is possible if we want it.\nLet us work together to make the noble ideals\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration a reality so\nthat we may lay the foundations of a planetary village\nfree of threats to the survival of mankind, such as the\nscourge of war, poverty, injustice and intolerance. I can\nsolemnly assure the Assembly that my country will\ncooperate to achieve that end.\n\n\n\n"

I should also like to take this\nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor for the farsightedness with which he led\nthe work of the fifty-fifth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI also wish, on behalf of my Government, to\nextend my warm congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on\nhis re-election as Secretary-General of our\nOrganization. His remarkable efforts in strengthening\nthe role of the United Nations and his numerous\ninitiatives to resolve conflicts have been eloquently\nattested to by his election to a second term of office,\nand even more by the Nobel Peace Prize that has just\nbeen awarded to him.\nThis session began in a very tragic climate in the\nwake of the cowardly and ignoble acts orchestrated by\nenemies of international peace and security. Those\nterrorist acts led to the deaths of thousands of innocent\nvictims in the cities of New York and Washington. This\nwas a very heavy blow to the Government and the\n20\n\npeople of the United States and also a challenge to the\nUnited Nations and to the entire international\ncommunity.\nThe Government of Rwanda learned of these\nignoble acts with indignation and consternation, and\nhas presented its condolences to the American\nGovernment and the families directly affected. The\nRwandan Government reiterates its condemnation of\nterrorism and remains open to all initiatives designed\nto combat all forms of terrorism. It is in this spirit that\nmy country unreservedly supports all the resolutions\nadopted against terrorism, in particular resolution 1373\n(2001) of 28 September, and we reaffirm our\ndetermination to implement them.\nThe acts of 11 September 2001 are a challenge to\nthe United Nations and to each of its Member States.\nSince the United Nations is the crucible of international\npeace and security, and since terrorist groups take\ninnocent human lives, it is up to every Member State,\nevery truly human organization and every person who\ncherishes peace and justice to fight as vigorously as\npossible against such a terrorist group, no matter what\nits pretext, no matter how powerful it may be. When\nwe say no matter how powerful, we know what we are\nsaying, having been victims ourselves.\nWe were victims of the terror not of just any\norganization, but of a State that in reality became a\nnon-State, but with all the State machinery available to\nit to fight the very people whose protection was its\nmost fundamental duty. Rwanda and its people lived\nunder the terror of a murderous, terrorist and genocidal\nState for three months. This reign of terror by a State,\nas the Assembly well knows, took more than 1 million\nhuman lives in 1994. The instruments of this blind,\nmerciless terror, whose overwhelming result was\ngenocide, are well known: the organization of\nparamilitary militias commonly known as the\nInterahamwe, and the former Rwandese Armed Forces,\nknown as the ex-FAR. From this rostrum we call for\nthese two organizations, which for a decade have been\nveritable killing machines, to be duly listed as terrorist\ngroups to be fought and pursued throughout the world.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which\nsince 1994 has been harbouring these forces of evil,\nhas fed them, has provided them with arms and\nmunitions and has allied itself with them, must respond\nto the Security Council\u2019s repeated appeals to stop all\nsupport for the negative forces on its territories,\nincluding the Interahamwe and ex-Far, which planned\nand carried out genocide in Rwanda.\nWith regard to peace in the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and throughout the Great Lakes region in\nAfrica, my country is determined to implement the\nLusaka Agreement, which, with respect to the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, has two important\ncomponents: the inter-Congolese dialogue, which\nshould lead to a political solution to the Congolese\ncrisis, and the disarmament and withdrawal of negative\nforces, which should lead to peace on the Rwandan,\nUgandan and Burundi borders of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nWe wish to note with great satisfaction, the\nactions of the sisterly Republic of South Africa, which,\ngiven the failure of inter-Congolese dialogue in Addis\nAbaba \u2014 because of, among other things, lack of\nfinancial resources \u2014 generously offered food and\nlodging to over 300 Congolese delegates going to that\ngreatly anticipated inter-Congolese forum. We wish\nalso to congratulate the Rassemblement congolais pour\nla d\u00e9mocratie (RCD)-Goma and the Mouvement pour\nla lib\u00e9ration du Congo (MLC)-Gbadolite on their fine\ninitiative to create a special force to carry out the\ndisarmament and disengagement of negative forces\nunder their control on the territory of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, and on having invited the\nKinshasa Government to join this initiative.\nRegarding human rights, we would like to\nreaffirm our attachment to the rule of law in\ninternational relations. We are determined to strengthen\nthe rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms. The Government of Rwanda\nwelcomed with great interest the report on human\nrights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\nregrettable, however, that the Special Rapporteur,\nMr. Roberto Garretn, was not present when the report\nwas submitted on 8 November 2001. Because of his\nabsence, no real debate between the parties concerned\nand the Rapporteur was possible. Once again, my\ndelegation finds this highly regrettable.\nThe report on human rights in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo contains numerous gratuitous\nallegations, including one on the alleged annexation of\nthat country. We would like to recall here that the\nregular Rwandan army did not cross borders into the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to annex\nthe country, as the report claims, but, as we have\n21\n\nexplained and demonstrated a number of times, to\nensure the security of our territory and our population.\nWe acted in the context \u201cof the inherent right of\nindividual ... self-defence\u201d of a country, as we are\nauthorized to do under Chapter VII, Article 51 of the\nCharter.\nIndeed, security in the north of Rwanda has been\nand continues to be constantly disrupted by the ex-FAR\nand the Interahamwe militia that committed the\ngenocide in 1994 and that are using Congolese territory\nas their rear base in order to repeat their gruesome\ndeeds. These armed groups are infiltrating Rwanda and\nkilling thousands of innocent people. We hope that\nphase III of the United Nations Organization Mission\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),\nin close cooperation with the initiative of the RCD\nGoma-MLC Gbadolite, will lead to the complete\ndisarmament of these groups and to stability and peace\nin the Great Lakes region.\nWe are pleased to note the establishment of a\nTransitional Government in Burundi. We believe that\nthis is a major step towards the reconciliation to which\nour brothers, the people of Burundi, aspire. Today the\nGreat Lakes region is seeking solutions to the conflicts\nthat undermine it. May the example of Burundi, under\nthe inspiration of President Nelson Mandela, bear fruit\nin the general interest and for the benefit of the people\nof Burundi and Africa as a whole.\nAlso regarding Africa, we feel that a definitive\nsolution to the problem of Western Sahara should also\nbe found.\nWe would like to see peace in the Middle East.\nThe question of Palestinian refugees, which is several\ndecades old, needs to be re-examined. Indeed, the\nexistence of an independent Palestinian State,\nalongside an independent Israeli State assured of its\nexistence as such is necessary for peace in the Middle\nEast. The friends of the Israelis and the Palestinians\nwithin the United Nations, including us, ought rather at\nthis stage to work on cultivating and strengthening\nrelations of friendship and cooperation between these\ntwo fraternal States \u2014 the Israeli State and the\nPalestinian State. We are anxious to start work on this\nnoble task.\nAside from Africa and the Middle East, we are\npleased to note the significant progress made on the\nKorean peninsula, where both Koreas have shown\nencouraging signs of reaching a final settlement of a\nconflict arose in the context of the cold war.\nThis fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\nis the first after the Millennium Summit, and thus\nshould follow it up and lay the new foundation for the\nfuture of mankind. The Summit stressed, among the\nvalues that underpin international relations and respect\nfor the fundamental principles of the Charter, the role\nthat the United Nations ought to play and\nrecommended the creation of a propitious climate for\nthe development of the least developed countries that\nwere not yet on the path towards globalization.\nThroughout this general debate poverty and the\nproblem of debt have been stressed as major obstacles\nto development and thus to entry into the era of\nglobalization. Globalization, with its advantages for\nsome and problems for others, does not seem to be able\nto resolve the problem of the gap between the rich and\npoor countries. To the contrary, the gap between them\ncontinues to grow. The marginalization of poor\ncountries in international trade and the debt burden\nhave severely hampered their efforts for development\nand have exacerbated their poverty. This is why the\nUnited Nations needs to define policies for the\ndevelopment of all and adopt international measures to\nsupport poor countries in the field of investment. Such\nmeasures should also be aimed at cancelling debt and\nensuring adequate integration of these countries into\nthe world economy.\nIn this context, we call on the United Nations to\nreconsider the report submitted to the Security Council\nby the Independent Inquiry led by Mr. Carlsson, former\nPrime Minister of Sweden, on which there has been no\nfollow-up to date. As a Member of the United Nations,\nwe believe that the Organization to which we belong\nshould undertake a follow-up to this report that defines\nwell the need for economic and social reconstruction in\npost-genocide Rwanda.\n\n\n"

Japan\nis determined to continue to extend its full support to\nthe President.\nI would also like on this occasion to extend my\nsincere congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, and to the United Nations on being named\nthe recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. I\nbelieve it is indeed a reflection of the international\ncommunity's appreciation for the efforts of the United\nNations, under the leadership of Secretary-General\nAnnan, for world peace and prosperity. The challenges\nfacing the international community, however, are\nbecoming increasingly diverse and difficult, and Japan\nwill cooperate fully with the activities of the United\nNations in responding to these situations.\nI deeply mourn the deaths of the victims of the\nseries of heinous terrorist attacks against the United\nStates on 11 September, who have left behind loving\nfamilies and friends in the United States and in many\nother countries. I extend my sincere condolences to the\nbereaved families and to all the people and the\nGovernment of the United States.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the terrorist\nattacks are threats against all humankind and are\nchallenges to democracy and freedom throughout the\nworld. The international community must establish a\nworld-wide circle of cooperation for the elimination of\nterrorism. In this context, I am encouraged that, in\nresponse to the recent attacks, the international\ncommunity is taking prompt actions at the United\nNations and in many other international and regional\norganizations and forums to prevent and eliminate\nterrorism. Considering the response to terrorism to be\nits own responsibility, Japan is determined to make the\nutmost efforts to prevent and eliminate such acts.\nJapan has made it clear that the terrorist attacks\non the United States must not be linked to Islamic\ndoctrine. It is extremely important that the international\ncommunity, transcending religious and ethnic\ndifferences, take unified actions to eliminate terrorism.\nThere are many things which the United Nations\nhas to do in order to eliminate terrorism. It is\nimperative that we faithfully and immediately\nimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\nand 1373 (2001). Japan is actively contributing to the\nwork of the Security Council in implementing\nresolution 1373 (2001). It is also important that all\nMember States accede to and fully observe the 12\ninternational conventions relating to terrorism and\naccelerate the work toward the adoption of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nand an international convention for the suppression of\nacts of nuclear terrorism.\nMoreover, certain biological weapons, such as\nanthrax, can be produced with more limited funds and\nless advanced technologies than nuclear and chemical\nweapons. It is important to strengthen the Biological\n14\n\nWeapons Convention in order to effectively prevent the\nproduction of such weapons.\nJapan is itself making various efforts to eliminate\nterrorism. First, with regard to treaties, there are two\ntreaties concerning terrorism which Japan has either\nnot yet signed or not yet ratified. The International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\nhas recently been approved by the Diet, and Japan will\nimmediately begin the ratification process. Japan\nsigned the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism on 30\nOctober and would like to ratify it as soon as possible.\nIn addition, Japan is ready to cooperate with\ndeveloping countries in the fields of controlling the\nfinancing of terrorism, immigration control, aviation\nand maritime safety, measures against terrorism\nthrough biological and chemical weapons, and so forth.\nMoreover, Japan will take more active measures\nagainst terrorism by enacting a new law to support the\noperations of other countries that are trying to\neliminate the threat posed by the recent terrorist attacks\nand to extend assistance to affected people.\nIn view of the importance of ensuring the stability\nof Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours, Japan is extending\nemergency economic assistance, which includes\nassistance to Afghan refugees, Pakistan and other\nneighbouring countries. Japan also decided to provide\nup to $120 million for Afghan refugee assistance\nefforts undertaken by United Nations agencies and\nother humanitarian organizations.\nWith winter approaching, there is an urgent\nhumanitarian need for the international community to\ndeliver food and other vital goods to the people in\nAfghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity to\ncall upon the international community to join forces in\nsupport of the humanitarian activities of United\nNations organizations.\nAs we look ahead to the future, the achievement\nof peace and stability in Afghanistan is extremely\nimportant not only to eliminate a hotbed of global\nterrorism but also to lay the foundation for the long-\nterm stability and development of the country and the\nneighbouring region. Based on this recognition, it is\nnecessary for the international community to tackle this\nissue from a long-term and broad perspective.\nTowards that end, it goes without saying that,\nfirst of all, a Government must be established that has\nthe broad support of the Afghan people, represents\nevery ethnic group, adheres to international law and\nestablishes friendly relations with the international\ncommunity, including with neighbouring countries.\nHowever, the realities in Afghanistan do not offer a\nclear perspective and thus entail many unpredictable\nelements. Japan fully supports the activities of\nSecretary-General Annan and his Special\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\nto promote political stability in Afghanistan and will\nactively cooperate with them.\nJapan intends to play an active role both in the\npeace process and in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\nWe have been calling for holding a conference for\npeace and reconstruction in Afghanistan since 1996,\nand I would like on this occasion to reaffirm that Japan\nis ready to hold such a conference to contribute to that\ncountry\u2019s peace and reconstruction at as early a time as\npossible, in cooperation with relevant countries and\norganizations.\nThe United Nations has serious responsibilities\nfor addressing relating to terrorism. Japan will spare no\neffort in order that this session of the General\nAssembly can be as fruitful as possible for this\npurpose.\n\n\n\n"

Such an analysis, it is to be hoped, will instruct\nus on how we may best respond to these new\nchallenges and pursue the twin goals of global peace\nand development in this new, twenty-first century.\nMr. President, it augurs well that this examination\nwill be conducted under your guidance, since, coming\nas you do from the land of the morning calm, you will\nno doubt bring to bear on our debate not only a fresh\nand dispassionate view, but also a ray of hope after the\nlong dark night through which we have just passed. My\ndelegation offers you our warmest congratulations and\ngood wishes as you continue to preside over the work\nof this historic General Assembly, which, though\ninaugurated in the depths of despair, may yet hold out\nthe promise of salvation for mankind.\nIt would be remiss of me were I not also to\nextend our gratitude to your distinguished predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, who presided with great verve and\nvigour over the Assembly through very difficult and\ninteresting times. He has contributed much to the\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\nconvey our greetings and commendation for his sure\nand steady leadership of our Organization. The recent\naward of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the United\nNations is a source of great satisfaction and pride for\nGuyana and, indeed, for the entire membership of this\nbody.\nAs was so aptly stated by the Economist of 15\nSeptember, the terrorist attack on the United States\naltered the geopolitical landscape as indelibly as it did\nthe Manhattan skyline. The world is a changed place\nsince that horrendous event, changed in that we\nsuddenly find, under threat, by unorthodox and hitherto\nunimaginable means, the values by which our\nOrganization is driven, values the attainment of which\nhave been the object of our onerous and protracted\nlabours for a period extending over many decades. We\ncannot help but feel a sense of sorrow and shame that\nsuch a barbaric act \u2014 as the destruction of the World\nTrade Center and a part of the Pentagon most certainly\nwas \u2014 could have occurred in this day and age only a\nshort distance from this house of our common\nhumanity.\nLike most leaders of the civilized world, the\nPresident of Guyana was swift to condemn this\negregious crime. As a small and vulnerable State, with\nlimited ability to defend itself in the event of\nencroachment on its territorial integrity, Guyana cannot\naccept the threat or the use of violence to resolve\nconflicts and disputes, whether inter-State or intra-\nState. All differences must be settled, as called for in\nthe Charter of the United Nations, by peaceful means,\nsuch as those prescribed in Article 33.\nThe violence which was visited two months ago\nupon some 5,000 human beings \u2014 including many of\n15\n\nour own nationals \u2014 in this our host city and, indeed,\nbefore that, upon so many other peoples and places in\nthe world, must be not only roundly condemned but\nalso condignly punished. The international community\nmust now develop an arsenal of appropriate legal\ninstruments, including a comprehensive convention\nagainst terrorism, to combat this new enemy of our\ntimes. The message must be clearly sent to all who\nwould use terrorism to pursue their objectives that their\nactions will not be tolerated by the Members of this\nOrganization but, instead, will be dealt with firmly\nwith the full force of the law.\nAt home and in our various regions, we must\nbuild defences that are strong enough to keep out\nterrorism and its concomitants, such as arms and drug\ntrafficking and other forms of transnational crime.\nWithin the Caribbean Community, of which Guyana is\na member, we have agreed to set up mechanisms for\ninformation sharing and coordinated action to deny\nthese criminal elements access to our territories. A\nregional task force has been established to identify\nmeasures necessary to creating a cordon sanitaire to\nhelp insulate us from their onslaught. This is not an\neasy mandate since, as the immigration doors in the\ndeveloped countries become more tightly closed,\nhundreds of criminals who have grown up in these\nsocieties are being deported now to our countries\nwhich, because of severe financial and human\nconstraints, are ill-equipped to handle this influx.\nAlthough perhaps not as immediate or striking as\nthese political and security consequences, the economic\nand social impact of the 11 September disaster has\nbeen no less powerful and pervasive. All countries\nhave undoubtedly been affected by the disaster, but\nsmall and vulnerable States such as my own will find it\nespecially difficult to cope with the resulting hardship.\nOur countries, with far fewer alternatives available to\nthem than to the more developed, because of an\nunfavourable international economic system, high\nlevels of external debt and unequal terms of trade, will\nsuffer disproportionately. The exporters of primary\nproducts, now as in the past, are the first to suffer a\ndownturn in the world economy and the last to\nrecover \u2014 a process that occurs with a frequency that\nis altogether too depressing.\nThese imbalances and asymmetries which\nseriously affect the progress of developing countries\nare now likely to become even more pronounced in the\nrapid process of globalization. Still, as is often said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ill wind that does not blow some good\u201d. We\nwould therefore wish to believe that out of the calamity\nwill come an improvement in our lot. We should not be\nso foolish, however, as to think that this will happen\nautomatically. Salvation will depend on our willingness\nto learn from our experience and to do better in the\nfuture. From the ashes of the Second World War arose\nthe phoenix of the United Nations, giving hope to new\ngenerations that they could live in peace, prosperity\nand larger freedom. Sadly, the end of the cold war did\nnot generate a similarly bold enterprise, leaving\nhumanity to wander aimlessly in search of peaceful\ncoexistence. We must therefore, before it is too late,\nhonour our commitment to the United Nations Charter\nand create a new vision and strategy with which we\nmay face the challenges of this new era.\nIn keeping with the spirit and substance of our\nhistoric compromise, we must act responsibly to\nremove from our midst all threats to global peace and\nsecurity. Foremost among these is the situation in the\nMiddle East, at the core of which is the Palestinian\nproblem, stemming from the persistent denial to an\nentire people of the enjoyment of their basic and\ninalienable rights. The peace process must be\nimmediately re-engaged with seriousness of purpose\nand determination to put an end, once and for all, to the\nsenseless violence and bloodshed which has been the\nunhappy fate of the Palestinian people and others.\nThey, as well as all other peoples in the region, must be\nallowed to live in a State of their own, free from fear or\nwant, within safe and secure borders. However, it is not\nonly the Middle East which suffers from the ravages of\nconflict. In far too many places \u2014 in Africa, Asia,\nLatin America and the Caribbean and Europe, the risk\nof violence is ever present, fuelled by a variety of\nfactors and made more dangerous by the possibility of\nfurther conflagration. To avert these threats, we must\nfully utilize the machinery provided in the Charter for\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes.\nYet, it is important in all of this that the Agenda\nfor Peace not be allowed to diminish or to displace the\nAgenda for Development since, were this to happen,\nthe prospects for any durable peace anywhere would be\nvirtually non-existent. Peace and development are\ninextricably intertwined, and any attempt to separate\nthem would not only be artificial but totally dangerous.\nWe would do well to bear this in mind should recent\nevents prompt a reordering of global priorities and lead\nto a diversion of attention from economic and social\n16\n\nissues to purely political and security concerns.\nAlready, in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the\nPresident of the World Bank was reported to have said\nthat the 2015 target for halving global poverty could\nnot now be reached and that, in fact, poverty would\nincrease over the next year or two. This deterioration is\nnot easily contemplated by small economies like our\nown and those of the Caribbean region.\nIn our view, it is imperative that the United\nNations now actively pursue the Agenda for\nDevelopment to enable developing countries,\nespecially the small and the vulnerable, to ride out the\ncurrent political and economic storms. The upcoming\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, which will take place in Monterrey,\nMexico, next March, represents a unique opportunity to\nexamine both the internal and external constraints that\nsignificantly affect the mobilization of financial\nresources for development, as well as to collectively\naddress the inefficiencies and inequities of existing\nfinancial markets. The high concentration of these\nmarkets on existing financial assets aimed at short-term\nprofit, rather than on new assets linked to the creation\nof wealth and employment for longer-term\ndevelopment, remains a source of great concern and\nmust be remedied.\nI think that we all must now acknowledge that the\nprevailing international system of development\ncooperation is seriously flawed and has failed to\nachieve its primary objective of increasing growth and\nimproving the quality of life in poor countries. Inherent\nin this system are many debt and poverty traps that\ncontinue to ensnare millions of the world\u2019s poorest\npeople, many of whom now have to face diseases such\nas AIDS. Not only is the experience painful, but it\noften also deprives the poor of their basic human\nrights, there being an undoubted nexus, now\nuniversally recognized, between the actualization of\nhuman rights and economic development. It is out of\nthis recognition that my delegation, last November,\nbrought resolution 55/48 before the General Assembly\non the role of the United Nations in promoting a new\nglobal human order.\nThe proposal for such an order acknowledges that\nthe major constraints affecting economic and social\nprogress in developing countries reside in the capacity\nlimitation in the critical areas of markets,\nadministrative and institutional infrastructures in both\nthe public and private sectors, the leveraging of\nresources and the ability of developing countries to\nnegotiate as equal partners in a number of forums\noutside the United Nations. This proposal therefore\nseeks to improve the effectiveness of development\ncooperation programmes, to optimize scarce financial\nresources and to reduce the spread of poverty. It also\naddresses new ways of managing development\ncooperation that would significantly overcome\nproblems of aid dependence, current imbalances and\nasymmetries in international trade, and the high\nindebtedness that continues to plague developing\ncountries.\nThese objectives, in the view of the Government\nof Guyana, can be achieved through a comprehensive\ndialogue among Governments, based not only on\npolitical and economic considerations, but also on\nethical and moral principles that are necessary to the\ncreation of a more humane and just order in the world.\nThis dialogue, which began at the last session of the\nGeneral Assembly, will be renewed at the fifty-seventh\nsession, when, we hope, the concept will be further\nembedded in the international consciousness and\nultimately accepted as the way forward to a more\nenlightened system of international relations.\nIt is entirely appropriate that this dialogue should\nbe held within the United Nations, since the\nmultifaceted and transnational nature of today\u2019s\nchallenges requires a multilateral, rather than a\nunilateral, approach. There is no doubt that the United\nNations is ideally suited to promote this global\npartnership in an environment that today requires firm,\nfocused and inclusive governance. Given the\nuniversality of the Organization\u2019s membership, the\nprinciples and values that it has long upheld and the\ngrowing interest of civil society in its activities, the\nUnited Nations has a singular opportunity now to\nexercise a leadership role in international political,\nsocial and economic policy-making.\nAt this time of great uncertainty and trepidation,\ntherefore, we must recognize, now more than ever\nbefore, the continuing need for the United Nations\nOrganization which, despite its many achievements in\nits 56 years of existence, has yet to fulfil its full\npotential with regard to international cooperation. We\nmust therefore not allow complacency, self-interest or\nunilateralism to compromise that global vision of the\nfounding Members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His\nelection is undoubtedly clear recognition of the\nRepublic of Korea's role in international affairs. We\nwould also like to express our gratitude to the President\nof the General Assembly at the previous session,\n22\n\nMr. Harri Holkeri. His successful presidency of the\nMillennium Summit and Assembly is a clear example\nof his personal talent and leadership skills.\nThe United Nations is entering the new century\nunder the leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan. His\nunanimous re-election by the General Assembly to a\nsecond five-year term came as an unequivocal\nacknowledgement of great appreciation for his work as\nSecretary-General. We welcome the recent well-\nfounded decision by the International Nobel Committee\nto grant the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations,\nand to Mr. Kofi Annan personally.\nThe consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember 2001 against New York and Washington,\nD.C., are as present and as painful as ever. In that\nregard, our country does not consider this session of\nthe General Assembly just a regular event in the life of\nthe United Nations. For Belarus, the point is that, as\nMember States, all of us must demonstrate collective\nwisdom and display the collective will to make our\nworld less vulnerable in the face of acts of insanity that\npush not only individual countries but the whole of\nhumanity to the very edge of a global catastrophe.\nAs a responsible member of the international\ncommunity, the Republic of Belarus cannot remain\nindifferent to this threat. In his message to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, the President of the Republic of\nBelarus, Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, clearly explained\nthe views of our country with regard to international\nactivities to combat terrorism:\nIn the present situation, the role of the United\nNations in consolidating the efforts of States in\nthe fight against terrorism is growing in stature.\nWe can achieve real success in this effort only\nwhen the unique capabilities of the United\nNations are used, especially as regards\neradicating the root causes that generate and\nsupport terrorism. We believe that the United\nNations should be at the centre of the efforts to\ndevelop strategies and tactics for the measures to\nbe taken by the international community to\ncombat terrorism.\nHaving actively supported all the anti-terrorist\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council and\nGeneral Assembly, and being party to the 12 United\nNations conventions on terrorism, Belarus welcomes\nthe measures aimed at defining and eradicating not\nonly terrorism itself but also its root causes. We firmly\nsupport the work of the Committee established by the\nSecurity Council under resolution 1373 (2001), and are\nready to cooperate closely with that body.\nLast year, during the Millennium Summit and\nAssembly, we called for the preservation of the United\nNations as a unique universal international institution\nuniting all the countries of the world. When we talk\nabout establishing the conditions necessary for\neffective implementation of the goals set out in the\nMillennium Declaration we are talking about the future\nof the Organization itself. We believe that the\nimplementation by the United Nations of the provisions\nof the Millennium Declaration during the first year\nafter the holding of the Millennium Summit is cause\nfor a certain optimism. In that regard, I would like to\nunderscore that the Republic of Belarus has already\ndrafted a special governmental programme on\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration.\nThe important thing that we have come to realize\nis that there is an organic link between development,\npeace and security in the context of globalization. The\nrecent tragic events in the United States of America\nreaffirmed that interdependence. Belarus welcomes the\nintensive work undertaken at the United Nations in\n2001 in preparation for the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development. We are convinced that this\nforum must lay the foundation for a new international\nconsensus on global economic and financial issues.\nBelarus believes that such a consensus should be built\nwhile taking into consideration the specific interests\nand needs of countries at different stages of social and\neconomic development. The overall success of the\nforum will ultimately depend on the application of that\napproach.\nWhile addressing the most pressing social and\neconomic challenges of the modern world, we must not\nweaken our focus on the area of international security\nand disarmament. The statistics on military\nexpenditures, which have reached $800 billion per year\nworldwide, are of particular concern in the present\nalarming international situation. It should be noted that\nour country has been pursuing a consistent policy in\nthe field of disarmament. We have made a significant\ncontribution to the consolidation and development of\ninternational non-proliferation regimes for weapons of\nmass destruction, including a reduction in the number\nof such weapons and the elimination of existing\narsenals.\n23\n\nBelarus has been consistently and\ncomprehensively fulfilling the provisions of all nuclear\ndisarmament treaties to which our country is a party.\nThe recent concluding inspection under the Treaty on\nthe Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-\nRange Missiles, which was carried out in Belarus in\nFebruary 2001, confirmed our country's strict\nobservance of all the conditions envisaged in that\ndocument. As a nation that voluntary relinquished\npossession of nuclear weapons and completely\nwithdrew them from its territory in 1996, Belarus is\ndetermined to advocate the necessity of providing\nlegally binding guarantees to non-nuclear States,\nincluding the elaboration of an appropriate\ninternational convention to that end.\nThe Republic of Belarus is among the States that\nconsider the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to be a\ncritical component of maintaining strategic stability.\nThe outcome of decades of tense negotiations in the\nsearch for a compromise that saved the world from a\ngrowing nuclear threat must not be dismissed. Strategic\nstability is a practical imperative for each and every\nState without exception. Negotiations on such an\nimportant issue should be conducted on a multilateral,\nnon-bloc basis with the participation of all interested\nStates and in strict conformity with the provisions of\nthe Charter.\nWe welcome the efforts undertaken for the\nuniversal prohibition of chemical weapons and support\nthe destruction, as soon as possible, of existing arsenals\nof weapons-grade poisons, as well as the efforts to\nachieve the universality of the Convention on the\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. This summer\nBelarus concluded its agreement with the Organization\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the\nprivileges and immunities of that organization.\nWe also pursue a similarly responsible and\nconsistent policy with regard to reducing conventional\nweapons. In strict implementation of the Treaty on\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe, Belarus was\namong the first of the parties to that Treaty to ratify the\nagreement on the adaptation of the Treaty. Ratification\nby the Republic of Belarus of the Treaty on Open Skies\nin 2001 is proof of our consistent policy in this field.\nOne important dimension of our foreign policy is\nto make practical contributions to the strengthening of\nregional stability, based on the principle of\ncomprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperation\nwith neighbouring countries in all areas relevant to\nsecurity and disarmament. As part of this policy,\nBelarus has concluded an agreement with Lithuania on\nmeasures for strengthening confidence and\ntransparency, and we are making progress towards\nsigning similar agreements with Ukraine and Poland.\nConflict prevention remains among the most\nimportant issues on the agenda of the United Nations.\nThe events of the past year have proved that the\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations, together\nwith the active personal involvement of the Secretary-\nGeneral and complemented by the work of regional\norganizations and individual United Nations Member\nStates, have been an effective  and very often the\nonly  solution to the escalation of conflicts in various\nregions of the world.\nThis is the appropriate point to mention the\nsituation in Afghanistan, which is of particular concern\nto the international community. Developments in that\ncountry and in the region as a whole run the risk of\nspiraling out of control. Military force cannot resolve\ncomplex problems that have been building up for years.\nWe are convinced that the complex tensions within\nAfghan society can be defused only by means of a\nbalanced domestic dialogue based on strict compliance\nwith the standards of international law.\nIt is essential not to weaken the intensifying\npolitical effort to give a new impetus to the peace\nprocess in the Middle East. There is no alternative to\nthe peaceful establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State through political negotiations, based\non the strict observance of Security Council resolutions\nalready adopted and the decisions of other relevant\ninternational forums. It is regrettable that the Security\nCouncil was unable to reach consensus on a United\nNations presence in the region at this crucial moment.\nWe consider it extremely important that we continue\nour efforts to settle unresolved problems on the\nLebanese track, in tandem with the complete\nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights.\nWe are also concerned about the situation in\nKosovo and Macedonia as the result of aggressive\nseparatism and international terrorism. Here, too, we\nbelieve that political logic must prevail over the logic\nof force. On the eve of the forthcoming general\nelection in Kosovo, Belarus confirms its adherence to\nthe principle of the territorial integrity of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and supports the diplomatic\n24\n\ninitiative by the Russian Federation legally to confirm\nthe existing national borders in the Balkans.\nThe situation in Africa continues to remain\nunstable. We believe that the establishment of the\nAfrican Union and the further strengthening of other\nAfrican regional structures, with an effective United\nNations involvement, are important prerequisites for\nthe maintenance of peace and stability in that\ncontinent. A comprehensive approach envisaging\nintegration of the political, economic and social\nresources of the African States is of crucial importance.\nBelarus supports the immediate implementation of all\nthe decisions taken at the Summit of the Organization\nof African Unity held in Lusaka, Zambia, in July 2001.\nIt is important to maintain the momentum that has\nbeen created in the political process leading to\nstatehood for East Timor and to its admission, as a\nfully fledged member, into the world family of nations.\nWe must encourage the active efforts being\nundertaken to continue dialogue, on the basis of\nequality, between North and South Korea.\nThe Cyprus problem continues to be a pressing\nissue. We call for the resumption of negotiations on\nthis question, in accordance with the provisions of the\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council.\nThe Republic of Belarus has been increasing its\nparticipation in major United Nations international\nlegal instruments in a number of strategically important\nareas. These include the combat against organized\ncrime and drug trafficking. Belarus has signed the\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational\nOrganized Crime and its supplementary Protocol to\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,\nEspecially Women and Children, as well as the\nProtocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land,\nSea, and Air.\nBeyond that, the Republic of Belarus has become\na party to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism, the Convention on the Safety of United\nNations and Associated Personnel, the Convention\nrelating to the Status of Refugees, the Protocol\nAmending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\nThe current session of the General Assembly\nrepresents an important stage in the process of\nestablishing a legal framework for Belarus to join the\nUnited Nations system of peacekeeping operations. On\n1 October 2001, the Republic of Belarus signed a\nmemorandum of understanding with the Secretariat\nregarding its participation in the United Nations\nStandby Arrangements System. We see the recent visit\nof representatives of the Department of Peacekeeping\nOperations to Belarus to test and select Belarusian\ncandidates for United Nations civilian police\ncontingents as an important initial step in the process\nof implementing this memorandum.\nOf major importance in the Millennium\nDeclaration is the promotion by Member States of the\nprinciples of sustainable development. It remains clear,\nhowever, that implementation of the paradigm of\nsustainable development in many developing countries\nand in countries with economies in transition continues\nto be confronted with major difficulties.\nIn this regard, we attach particular importance to\npreparations for the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg in 2002. We\nconsider the Rio + 10 Summit to be an appropriate\nforum for defining new approaches to the solution of\nglobal problems and for developing new and effective\nfinancial, institutional and legal mechanisms for their\nimplementation.\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\nfundamental importance to my country, since it will\nconsider issues relating to the cleanup of the\nconsequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear\npower plant. The economic, social and humanitarian\nramifications of this problem cannot be overestimated.\nSuffice it to mention here just one figure: over the past\ndecade, Belarus has spent $12.5 billion on the cleanup\nof the Chernobyl disaster. However, the people living\nin the contaminated areas have not yet been able to\nreturn to their normal way of life. There is a need\nfurther to rally international support for my country's\nefforts to mitigate and minimize the aftermath of the\nChernobyl catastrophe.\nIn this context, we greatly appreciate the\ninitiatives proposed by the Under-Secretary-General\nfor Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, to\nintensify international post-Chernobyl cooperation,\nincluding shifting its focus towards assistance for\nsustainable development of the contaminated areas and\nenhancing the region's human potential. The findings\nand outcome of the special United Nations assessment\nmission to the three most affected States earlier this\n25\n\nyear are expected significantly to contribute to the\nunderstanding of what precisely should be done in the\nnear future. In the course of the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly, a draft resolution entitled\nStrengthening of International Cooperation and\nCoordination of Efforts to Study, Mitigate and\nMinimize the Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster\nhas jointly been submitted by the Governments of\nBelarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. I call\nupon all delegations to support it.\nIn his road map towards the implementation of\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration, our\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, observed quite\nrightly that\nThe international community has just emerged\nfrom an era of commitment. It must now enter an\nera of implementation. (A/56/326, para. 11)\nThis means that the successful implementation of\nthe Organization's strategy in this era of globalization\ndepends on us, as United Nations Member States, and\nus alone. This is not only our common privilege; it is\nalso our common responsibility.\nBelarus is confident that the United Nations and\nthe international community are capable of mobilizing\npolitical will and technological and intellectual\nresources for the sake of building a stable and\nprosperous world.\nFor the Republic of Belarus, the tenth anniversary\nof its independence coincided with the second\npresidential elections in the history of my country. The\nsupport of the overwhelming majority of voters for\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka confirmed the soundness\nof the democratic foundations of the Belarusian\nsociety.\nSimilarly, the foreign policy of our country will\nremain consistent and constructive. It will be guided\nexclusively by the basic principles of the United\nNations Charter and universally recognized norms of\ninternational law, including the aspiration for the\nestablishment of a world order in which the interests of\nall countries, big and small, developed and developing,\nin both the North and the South, are equitably taken\ninto account. Cooperation with all United Nations\nMember States on a mutually beneficial and\nconstructive basis will remain the central priority for\nthe Republic of Belarus.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have\nthe honour today to speak on behalf of the European\nUnion, which wishes, through you, Sir, to congratulate\nthe President on his election. That election testifies to\nthe esteem of the international community for his\nperson and his country. I commend the speed of action\nand efficiency that you have shown in the face of the\ntragic events of 11 September, in adapting the agenda\nfor the work of this Assembly.\nI would also like to associate with this tribute the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.\nMr. Secretary-General, your re-election had already\ndrawn attention to the unanimous appreciation of the\nMember States for your exceptional qualities as a\nmanager, politician and humanist. The Nobel\nCommittee paid an even wider tribute by awarding you\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. The United Nations itself, here\nat your side, was also a recipient of this message of\nhope from a world in a state of shock, appealing to the\nUnited Nations to remain at the centre of the\ninternational community\u2019s action for peace and\ndevelopment.\nIt was the fundamental values constituting the\nfoundation of the United Nations that were attacked in\nso cowardly a manner right here in New York on 11\nSeptember, when our host country, several thousands of\nits citizens and nationals of over 60 countries were the\n37\n\nvictims of a barbaric act of aggression for which no\njustification can be accepted.\nThat attack, by its enormity, has opened our eyes\nto the worldwide threat that terrorism has become. It is\nour open, democratic, tolerant and multicultural\nsocieties that were attacked through the United States.\nThe terrorist threat must be hunted down in each of our\ncountries, in our various regional organizations and, at\nthe world level, through the United Nations.\nThe European Union has most categorically\ncondemned the 11 September attacks, and the fight\nagainst terrorism is now, more than ever before, one of\nour top objectives. The Union has declared its total\nsolidarity with the United States. It has reaffirmed its\nunreserved support for the military action undertaken\nin the name of legitimate self-defence, in conformity\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and Security\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001).\nOn 21 September, an Extraordinary European\nCouncil adopted an action plan for an unprecedented\ncampaign against terrorism. This plan contains a\nnumber of specific measures intended to enhance\njudicial and police cooperation, including the\nintroduction of a European arrest warrant. It also\nincludes measures to put an end to the financing of\nterrorism and to improve air security. The European\nCouncil acknowledged that the fight against terrorism\nrequires greater participation by the Union in the\nefforts of the international community to prevent and\nstabilize regional conflicts. By developing the\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy and bringing the\nEuropean Security and Defence Policy into operation\nas soon as possible, the Union will be at its most\neffective.\nAt the global level also, fresh impetus must be\nprovided to the fight against terrorism. Naturally, the\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in developing\na coordinated and diversified strategy. We warmly\nwelcome the major steps that have already been taken\nto that end. The most remarkable of these was the\nadoption of resolution 1373 (2001) by the Security\nCouncil on 28 September. The European Union and its\nmember States are already committed to rapid\nenactment of the measures needed for its\nimplementation. We call upon all countries to\ncooperate actively with the follow-up system set up by\nthe Security Council, and we reiterate our readiness to\nprovide aid in that connection to any countries that\nmay have technical difficulties in meeting the\nrequirements.\nIt is also essential that all States ratify without\ndelay the 12 conventions on combating terrorism and\napply all of their provisions. The International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism is a decisive aspect of international action\nand needs to be speedily signed and ratified.\nLastly, the European Union welcomes the recent\nprogress made in negotiating a comprehensive\nconvention on international terrorism, on the basis of a\ndraft submitted by India. The remaining difficulties\nmust now be dealt with as soon as possible so that this\ninstrument can be ready for signing early next year.\nThe efforts we are making to combat terrorism\nmust also form part of overall efforts to build a better\nworld, a world in which human dignity is sacrosanct, in\nwhich human rights and fundamental freedoms are\nfully respected.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights\nand an attachment to the principles of democracy and\nthe rule of law are essential components of the\nEuropean Union\u2019s Common Foreign and Security\nPolicy and of its development, cooperation and\nexternal relations. The European Union will actively\npursue its work on consolidating human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, with particular insistence on the\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent nature of all\nhuman rights. It will continue to support efforts by the\nSecretary-General to integrate human rights into\nUnited Nations activities at all levels and in all forums,\nand to cooperate with all United Nations human rights\nmachinery.\nThe European Union welcomes the imminent\nestablishment of the much-awaited International\nCriminal Court. The Union sees this as being of\nparamount importance and urges all States that have\nnot yet done so to accede to the Rome Statute as soon\nas possible. More than ever before, we need a universal\nand permanent court capable of sanctioning the most\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\nand human rights, thereby contributing to peace and\nsecurity in the world. It is vital that the United Nations\ngive effective support to the establishment of the\nCourt.\nFollowing the tragedy of 11 September, the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the 10-year\n38\n\nreview of the World Summit for Children had to be\npostponed. However, until it is held, we need to keep\nup the momentum developed in the preparatory\ndiscussions. We must continue to integrate the specific\ndimension of the child into our actions and strive to\nensure that every child\u2019s life is free from terror, the\nhorrors of war, abuse and exploitation, hunger and\npoverty.\nThe European Union is resolved to continue the\nfight against all forms of discrimination and violence\nagainst women, and to ensure that all countries take\nstrong measures to apply the Convention on the\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\nWomen. Women must be able to enjoy their human\nrights in full, on an equal footing with men. Girls must\nhave the same opportunities as boys, particularly in\neducation and access to social services. The European\nUnion insists also that there be equal rights to property,\ncredit facilities and social services, including\nreproductive health services. It is in the interest of\neveryone that women be able to participate fully in\neconomic and political life at all levels.\nThe Union stresses the importance of\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)\nand the special attention that must be given to the\nparticipation and full association of women on an equal\nfooting in all efforts aimed at maintaining and\npromoting peace and security.\nWe must also vigorously pursue the crucial fight\nagainst racist and discriminatory tendencies and\nintolerance, which are daily realities throughout the\nworld. The World Conference against Racism, Racial\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\nhas, I believe, shown us the way forward. It has also\nenabled us to advance our ways of thinking about the\ncauses and origins of racism and, above all, to view our\npast in a new way. What matters now is that we find\nthe will to close the darkest chapters of our history so\nthat we can build a new relationship based on mutual\nrespect, solidarity and partnership.\nThe terrible humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is\ngripping the attention of the international community\njust as much as the political, diplomatic, military and\neconomic aspects of the situation in that country. This\nis the first time that the international community has\nadopted such a global approach to an armed conflict.\nWe are convinced that this is the best \u2014 if not the\nonly \u2014 way to ensure effective resolution of the crisis.\nThe coordination of aid efforts, primarily on the ground\nand as part of the range of actions undertaken by the\nUnited Nations, remains essential.\nEmergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan is an\nabsolute priority for the European Union, which has\nundertaken to mobilize an aid package of over 320\nmillion euros as soon as possible. The Union expresses\nits concern about the difficulties of access, as well as of\ndelivering humanitarian assistance, in Afghanistan. It\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations specialized\nagencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross\nand all humanitarian organizations in seeking practical\nand flexible solutions. It also calls on the countries of\nthe region to facilitate, by all possible means,\nhumanitarian operations to deal with new influxes of\nAfghan refugees.\nThe European Union recognizes the vital role of\nthe United Nations in the search for a peace plan for\nAfghanistan. It intends to support the initiatives of the\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative and\nto make a constructive contribution, with regard to\nboth the search for an internal political solution and to\na plan for rebuilding the country. The Union also\nstresses the importance of the regional dimension of\nthe stabilization of Afghanistan.\nWe must make adequate contributions to the\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs so\nas to ensure that it can function efficiently. The\nEuropean Union attaches particular importance to aid\nto persons displaced within their countries. We\ntherefore welcome the fact that a unit has been\nestablished within the Secretariat to cater to their\nspecific needs. Following the recent attacks against\nhumanitarian aid personnel, the European Union can\nonly call once again for the strengthening of\narrangements, particularly those of a legal and financial\nnature, for guaranteeing the safety and security of\nhumanitarian aid workers and United Nations workers\nin general.\nNow more than ever, disarmament and non-\nproliferation constitute the cornerstone of any peace\nand security structure, and must therefore be subject to\nbinding multilateral norms. It is against that\nbackground that we wish to strengthen the non-\nproliferation regime, promote the rapid entry into force\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\nreinforce the biological and toxin weapons Convention.\nWe must also combat the proliferation of ballistic\n39\n\nmissiles and the illicit trade in light weapons and\ncontinue to work for the complete elimination of anti-\npersonnel mines.\nWith regard to peacekeeping, the United Nations\nhas shown in the past year that it is better equipped and\nbetter organized than it has been in recent times. By\nway of example, I should like to mention the\noperations in East Timor, Eritrea and Sierra Leone.\nProgress has thus already been made on the ground in\nimplementing the recommendations of the Brahimi\nreport. But much remains to be done, and the European\nUnion will continue to provide its active support for\nimproving the capabilities of the Department of\nPeacekeeping Operations and advocating that the\nOrganization be given the resources that it needs to\nenable it effectively to discharge its increasingly\ncomplex responsibilities.\nA comprehensive and long-term approach is\nrequired in order to resolve differences of opinion,\nconsolidate peace and prevent a resurgence of conflict.\nThe European Union, which is currently establishing\nits own military and civil crisis-management capability,\nis actively engaged in strengthening its cooperation\nwith the United Nations and other international\norganizations in the area of conflict prevention, crisis\nmanagement, humanitarian aid, post-conflict\nreconstruction and long-term development.\nThe Balkans, a region so close to the countries of\nthe European Union, remains at the centre of the\nUnion\u2019s external activities. We resolutely maintain our\ncommitment to contribute to building a region of\nsecurity, prosperity and democracy there, where multi-\nethnic societies can be free to flourish. Progress has\nbeen remarkable and encouraging, but unfortunately in\nmany cases the situation remains fragile. The\ninternational community must remain vigilant and must\nnot let extremists, of whatever kind, use violence to\ndestroy the stabilization work already carried out.\nThe situation in the Middle East is worsening.\nThe lack of any political perspective naturally\nencourages continued confrontation and plays into the\nhands of extremists. Defiance, fear and resentment\nradicalize people\u2019s mindsets. The European Union calls\non Israelis and Palestinians, while there is still time,\nimmediately to resume the peace process, without\npreconditions, on the basis of the Mitchell report. It\ncalls on the Israeli authorities to immediately withdraw\ntheir forces from Palestinian-administered areas. It\ncalls on the Palestinian Authority to do its utmost to\narrest those responsible for violence against Israel.\nIt is necessary to preserve what has been achieved\nso far in the peace process: the principles of the Madrid\nConference, in particular the principle of land for\npeace, as well as Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and the agreements signed by\nthe parties, which have already led to real results on the\nground and to progress on the basis of earlier\nnegotiations. The European Union calls on both parties\nto do their utmost in the political, security, economic\nand social areas in order to get back to the negotiating\ntable, without preconditions, with the objective of\nrealizing the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the\nregion, as set out at the Madrid Conference of 1991.\nFor the Palestinians, the establishment of a viable\ndemocratic State and an end to the occupation of their\nterritory is essential. The Israelis must have the right to\nlive in peace and security within internationally\nrecognized borders. The European Union also recalls\nthat the search for a comprehensive and lasting peace\nin the region requires due account to be taken of the\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the\nconflict. The same principles should apply in the\nresolution of those situations.\nIt is primarily for the parties themselves to try to\nfind peace through negotiating all elements relating to\npermanent status. This will include finding a viable and\njust solution to the particularly complex issues of\nJerusalem and the refugees, as well as those of the\neconomic support for the Palestinian people.\nThe European Union, in close cooperation with\nthe United States of America and the other partners\ninvolved, reaffirms its willingness to work for a final\nsettlement to the conflict. We believe that it is now a\nmatter of urgency to develop an initiative to strongly\nurge the parties to resume their political dialogue.\nThe European Union finds the status quo in\nCyprus unacceptable. We express our disappointment\nat the unjustified decision of the Turkish side to decline\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s invitation to pursue talks. We\ncontinue to support the Secretary-General\u2019s endeavours\ntowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the\nCyprus question in accordance with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nThe scale of the tragedies on the African\ncontinent demands resolute action on our part, at all\nlevels, to address the direct structural causes of those\n40\n\nconflicts. Conflicts in Africa have become increasingly\ncomplex and their cross-border effects increasingly\ndestructive. The crises in the Great Lakes region of\nWest Africa, in Zimbabwe and in the Horn of Africa\nrequire increased vigilance on the part of the\nOrganization. Those crises also show the need for a\ncomprehensive and integrated international approach.\nWe gave an enthusiastic welcome to the launch of the\nNew African Initiative at the Lusaka summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity. The European Union\nhas stated its willingness to respond and has already\nentered into a dialogue at the highest level with the\nAfrican Union.\nAt the Millennium Summit, we pledged together\nto attain a set of development objectives. That is an\nambitious project which involves, inter alia, good\ngovernance in each country and at the international\nlevel. The Union underlines the need for strengthened\npartnership between rich countries and poor countries\nto achieve the development objectives of the\nMillennium Declaration. That partnership entails\nobligations and joint but varied efforts on the part of all\ncountries.\nFirst of all, we must make every effort to\neradicate poverty. New, concrete commitments were\nmade at the third United Nations Conference on Least\nDeveloped Countries, held at Brussels last May. The\nEuropean Union committed itself to untying aid, to\nopening up its markets through the \u201ceverything but\narms\u201d initiative and to the full financing of the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. It is\nnow a question of finalizing the follow-up mechanisms\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\nCountries. The European Union will also continue to\ngive priority to the development of Africa.\nTwo major international conferences will give us\nan opportunity to take up the challenges and achieve\nthe principal objectives of the Millennium Declaration.\nAt the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held next March at Monterrey,\nMexico, we shall focus on improving cooperation\namong all development actors, and on using resources\nmore effectively and better mobilizing them.\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be held at Johannesburg in October\n2002, we wish to promote the sustainable use and\nmanagement and the protection of the natural resources\nthat are the underpinning of economic and social\ndevelopment. We wish also to integrate action on the\nenvironment and poverty, to ensure that globalization\nserves the needs of sustainable development, and to\npromote better ways of managing public affairs and\nparticipation. The European Union would like to\nexplore with its partners the possibility of achieving at\nthe Summit a global pact on sustainable development.\nSuch a pact should contain commitments both from\nGovernments and from other actors. A global pact\nshould lead to concrete action to improve the\nimplementation of sustainable development policies.\nWe hope that United Nations Member States will\nwithout delay commit themselves to be represented at\nMonterrey and at Johannesburg at the highest possible\npolitical level.\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change was one of the major results of the\n1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment. We welcome the progress made at Bonn\nand at Marrakesh, and we undertake speedily to ratify\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\nWe have also just reached an intergovernmental\nconsensus at the highest level on the strategy needed to\nhalt the appalling global AIDS pandemic. That was a\nmajor step forward, but the urgent and tragic nature of\nthe problem demand greater ambition. We will actively\ncontribute to the creation of the new Global Fund to\ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and we\nwill play an active role in all the other processes that\nemerged from last June\u2019s special session so that the\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS is put into\npractice through concrete measures.\nAmong other challenges, the demographic\nchanges that lie ahead are of particular interest to the\nEuropean Union. The second World Assembly on\nAgeing, to be held at Madrid in April 2002, will be an\nopportunity for us to work together to build a society\nfor all ages.\nThe Millennium Summit enabled us to tackle, at\nthe highest level, the major challenges facing the world\ncommunity. We must now turn our attention to the\nprocess of following up the Declaration adopted by\nheads of State or Government with all due regard for\nthe lofty and balanced aims of that cardinal text. For\nthat, we need reliable data and depend on the existing\nfollow-up machinery and processes and on the\nconcerted efforts of the various actors in the\n41\n\ninternational community who can help us to achieve\nthose objectives.\nWe must also continue reform of the United\nNations system as a whole, including the specialized\nagencies and the operational funds and programmes.\nThe strengthening of the Security Council and its\ncomprehensive reform in all its aspects should be\npursued with determination. If we want a Security\nCouncil capable of responding even more effectively to\nthe major challenges of the moment, we must intensify\nour efforts.\nLooking beyond the tremendous and growing\ncomplexity of our actions at the international level, our\ndebate should highlight this basic truth: if we want to\nbuild a world made more peaceful by respect for the\nlaw, solidarity and tolerance, we must strengthen our\ncohesiveness in the face of the new challenges before\nus, and also step up our efforts to promote human\nrights, eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIn this forum of the United Nations, we reply to\nthe messengers of destruction with our common ideal,\nwhich will be stronger than hatred and division among\nmankind. That edifice, whose foundations are set in our\nspirits and in our hearts, will be unassailable.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin, Sir, by\ncongratulating President Han Seung-soo on his election\nas President of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. I would like also to express our appreciation\nof and respect for Mr. Harri Holkeri for the\nprofessionalism and dedication with which he\nconducted the previous session.\nSince the acts of terrorism on 11 September, each\nof us, as individuals and as leaders responsible for the\nfuture of our planet, has been trying to understand what\nhappened \u2014 why and how. The universal\ncondemnation of the arrogance and fascist mentality\n9\n\nthat conceives and implements such terror could not\nhave been more justified. The immediate determination\nthat the perpetrators must be punished and their bases\neliminated was necessary and prudent. The awareness\nthat this is a long and complex process remains\nevident.\nScholars and analysts have attempted to explore\nand explain that day of terror, its causes and its\nramifications. This is a necessary process that, if we\nare patient, will begin with more questions than\nanswers. Listening will inevitably lead to dialogue, not\njust this year, but every year. If we are honest, this\ndialogue will reflect the fact that, although we all see\nquite plainly that there has been a change, we do not\nagree on what that change is or how it affects each of\nus.\nThere are those who believe that the world has\nbeen taken off the path of economic globalization and\ndemocratization. There are some who insist that the\nnature and course of international relations has\nirrevocably changed \u2014 that the world order, as it\nexisted, has come crashing down. That may be the\ninescapable, though illusory, initial reaction. It may\nappear that bilateral and multilateral relations have\nbeen fundamentally and involuntarily re-tailored.\nYet if this perception becomes more than a\nnatural temporary reaction \u2014 if the terrorists succeed\nin intimidating us, and force us to take actions that are\nnot in our best interests, causing us to abandon\nprinciples and agendas \u2014 then the terrorists will have\nsucceeded. They will have terrorized their way to\nsetting agendas and determining policies. But just as\nNew Yorkers have vowed continued allegiance to their\ncity and their way of life, the international community,\ntoo, must remain true to its structures, traditions and\nagenda.\nThat is not to say, however, that life has returned\nto business as usual, or that it can do so. It certainly\ncannot return to thinking as usual. Our allied approach\nto the problems and realities that we collectively face\nrequires genuine, radical rethinking. The deep\ndissatisfaction, injustice, poverty and hopelessness \u2014\nwhich do not justify terror but serve to validate it,\nlegitimize it and guard it \u2014 must be addressed and\neradicated, too. These deep-problems must be replaced\nby equality, education, social justice, women\u2019s and\nchildren\u2019s human rights, civil liberties and democracy.\nArmenia readily joined the global struggle to\neradicate the terrorism network because the success of\nthis effort is as important for us as it is for the coalition\nleaders. However, Armenia asks that, in our effort and\nexercise of responsibility, to neutralize this enemy, we\nbe careful about our own definitions and labels. Just as\nit is crucial to ensure solidarity in the united battle\nagainst the evil of terrorism, a divergence of\ninterpretative opinion or varied agendas should not be\nconstrued as lack of solidarity.\nJust as the coalition leaders are concerned about\nthe effects of terrorism on their countries, peoples,\nlifestyles and values, Armenia is concerned about how\nthe advent of such terror, and the extended battle\nagainst it, will affect our region and our country. The\nwar on terrorism has added a further dimension to our\ndomestic and foreign policy agenda, not narrowed its\nfocus. The economic and political conditions which\nmake ours a volatile region have not gone away.\nIndeed, they have been exacerbated by the new\nalliances and priorities. Worse still, they might be\nfurther aggravated if they are ignored and allowed to\nlie latent while all attention is focused on the\nimmediate danger. In focusing on the hatred of\nthousands, we do not want to dismiss the frustration\nand needs of millions, many of whom stand at the brink\nof war.\nThat is why, even as Armenia has offered\nunreserved cooperation with the global coalition,\nsigned the United Nations and Council of Europe anti-\nterrorism conventions, and offered military and\nstrategic assistance, we continue to insist that the\nfundamental short- and long-term developmental issues\nfacing us also be dealt with. We are worried about the\nstability of our region, because the basic freedoms\nwhich are the hallmarks of modern society and which\ndecrease the likelihood of violent social and political\nsolutions are not universally guaranteed in our\nneighbourhood.\nSecurity and peace around the world depend on\nstability in each region. If we are committed to world\npeace and security, each of us in our own region must\ntake on the responsibility to address the outstanding\nissues in a new light, guided by new thinking. It\nremains for the leaders to abandon the expediency of\nrealpolitik for the efficacy of \u201cjustpolitik\u201d. This is\nnothing that has not been said before, but perhaps in\nthis new environment of searching, our call will not fall\non deaf ears. Our region has the wealth, the traditions,\n10\n\nthe opportunities and the links that can make it flourish\nand thrive.\nAs far as Armenia\u2019s contribution to peace and\nstability in the Caucasus is concerned, there are two\nintertwined issues affecting our relations with two of\nour neighbours. One is the absence of relations with\nTurkey, to the west; the other is the Nagorny Karabakh\nconflict, which affects our relations with Azerbaijan.\nFor the past 10 years, representatives of my\nGovernment have, from this podium, affirmed that\nbasic freedoms of thought, belief, conviction, ethics,\ntraditions, values and culture also apply to the men,\nwomen and children of Nagorny Karabakh. This lies at\nthe heart of the conflict over Nagorny Karabakh.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s insistence on inventing numbers,\nredefining terms, creating history and obfuscating\ndiscussion are part of the problem, not the search for a\nsolution. In response to the charges made today by my\ncolleague from Azerbaijan with regard to Armenia and\nNagorny Karabakh, let me say the following. Nagorny\nKarabakh has never been a part of independent\nAzerbaijan. Whether we consider history or geography,\nwhether we adopt a long-term political perspective or\nface the reality of the facts on the ground, the men,\nwomen and children of Nagorny Karabakh have earned\nthe right to live peacefully on their historic lands. For\ndecades they have been denied that right. Today, a\ndozen years after the re-eruption of the conflict, the\nchildren of Karabakh have completed an entire school\ncareer free of alien domination and foreign occupation.\nJustice for the people of Nagorny Karabakh has\nbeen at the core of Armenia\u2019s policies and actions, not\njust because we believe it is right, but also because we\nbelieve that, in order to achieve lasting peace,\neconomic cooperation and political development, this\nconflict will have to be resolved fairly and fully.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s empty calls for a military solution, which\narise from an adherence to old clich\u00e9s rather than from\nnew realities, are not acceptable among neighbours that\nare serious about peace.\nAs for our relations with Turkey, in this post-\n11 September world, when the cold war has truly and\nfinally ended, where erstwhile adversaries have found\nreasons to put aside ideology and establish\npartnerships, perhaps Turkey will put aside\npreconditions in the interests of regional and world\npeace. Armenia would like to have normal, good-\nneighbourly relations with Turkey, and is hopeful that\nTurkey will establish diplomatic relations with\nArmenia, open the borders and engage in constructive\ncooperation.\nBut the obvious must be stated. The memory of\nthe Armenian genocide continues to haunt and obstruct\nTurkey\u2019s relations with Armenia. However, we are\nconfident that this issue can be addressed between the\ntwo Governments, through dialogue. The events of the\npast two months have reminded Armenians that man is\nindeed capable of immense, indescribable evil and that\nmass violence is not a thing of the past. Yet if we, as\nthe victims of genocide, are unwilling to permit our\nown tragic past to define our actions in the future, we\ncan confidently call on Turkey to do the same, and to\njoin us as equal participants in a dialogue between our\ntwo peoples.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\nprovides the most overarching and inclusive framework\nfor creating the conditions that make States and\npeoples prefer peace to war. The United Nations \u2014\nacting, where possible, with various multilateral and\nregional organizations \u2014 should identify and utilize\nthe comparative advantage and specificity of each\ninstitution and each country as a potential fighter, as a\npotential instrument in the war for peace, and even as a\npotential victim.\nThe United Nations did not need 11 September to\nacknowledge economic development and poverty\neradication as strategic battlefields in the war against\nterrorism. Donor countries can contribute to the\nsuccess of this war by providing not only military\nforces, but also greater financial and technical\nassistance.\nSuch assistance must be coordinated. The new\nchallenges call for the consolidation of existing\nmechanisms of international dialogue, cooperation and\nsecurity. The United Nations can make a major\ncontribution to this process, especially if it reflects, in a\nmore equitable manner, the political and economic\nrealities of today\u2019s world. We believe that real reform\nof the Security Council lies in the expansion of both\ncategories: permanent and non-permanent. We support\nthe desire of Germany and Japan to become permanent\nmembers of the Security Council.\nArmenia also attaches great significance to the\nissue of equitable geographic representation, and hence\nit supports increased representation for\nunderrepresented regions, especially Asia, Africa,\n11\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean. In this regard,\nArmenia is equally supportive of India\u2019s quest for\npermanent membership in the Security Council. We\nbelieve strongly that any increase in non-permanent\nmembership should also ensure enhanced\nrepresentation for the Group of Eastern European\nStates through the allocation of one additional non-\npermanent seat.\nModern life has caused upheavals in static\nsocieties, and the answer lies not in any particular faith\nbut in healthy, democratic institutions and legislation\nand viable economic systems.\nWriter V. S. Naipaul made that assertion, and this\nyear he was awarded a Nobel Prize, as was Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan. This choice of recipients provides\nmuch food for thought. Neither has been exclusivist;\nthey have both been inclusive, as can be seen in their\nability to bring their deep-rooted traditions to bear on\nthe challenges facing our global society. While Naipaul\nthe writer teases and provokes, Annan the diplomat\nchallenges and soothes. They both do so with grace and\nfrom positions of strength. They can both afford to be\nmore extreme in their pronouncements, but they are\nnot.\nThe message here is that in this year of dialogue\namong civilizations, there are successful ways of\nmerging the best of the world\u2019s traditions, even while\nchallenging the world to move forward towards justice\nand democracy for all. Naipaul and Annan do not reject\nthe failures of the world, but challenge us to address\nthem. We, collectively, could do worse than to follow\ntheir example.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. Han\u2019s election to the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tribute\nto his vast experience and accomplished diplomatic\nskills. It is also an honour to his country, the Republic\nof Korea, with which my country enjoys the most\ncordial and friendly relations. I ask him to please\naccept our congratulations.\nMay I also express our gratitude and appreciation\nto his immediate predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\nFinland, for the able manner in which he guided the\nwork of the fifty-fifth session.\nI wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of the\nGovernment and the people of Ghana to the States\nMembers of the United Nations for having placed their\ntrust and the destiny of this universal Organization\nonce again in the hands of an illustrious son of Ghana\nand of Africa, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the next five years.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize, awarded jointly to the\nSecretary-General and the United Nations, is in\nrecognition of their devotion to the pursuit of global\npeace and security. On this occasion, I can only\nendorse the sentiments expressed by Mr. Annan that\nthe award should serve as an impetus to record greater\nachievements in the service of humanity.\nThe last century witnessed laudable achievements\nin the political, economic, scientific and technological\nspheres. Despite these positive developments, history,\nin the end, will remember it for the numerous conflicts\nthat marked it, with their attendant socio-economic\ndisruptions, environmental degradation, the emergence\nof hitherto-unknown diseases and the persistence of\npoverty among the majority of our people.\nThe tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001\nawakened the world to the new challenges confronting\ninternational peace and security. The fight against\nterrorism must be a collective action, guided by the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nand of international law. Ghana welcomes the\ninternational community\u2019s response in confronting this\nthreat to peace and security. We also applaud the swift\nresponse of the Security Council and of the General\nAssembly, which not only condemned the attacks, but\nalso took measures aimed at confronting terrorism.\nResolution 1373 (2001), which outlines the measures\nthat all countries \u2014 irrespective of size, wealth or\nmight \u2014 should adopt to forestall and combat terrorism\nmust be pursued by all peace-loving nations.\nAs we forge ahead, our quest to free the world of\nterrorism will be enhanced if we adequately address\n24\n\nboth the symptoms and the underlying causes that give\nrise to such criminal acts. Developing countries should\nbe provided with the necessary resources to play a\nmeaningful role in confronting these challenges.\nThe recent threats and crimes against humanity\nhave reinforced our belief in the need for the early\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, in\norder to enable the global community to deal\nappropriately with such phenomena. We therefore urge\nall Member States that have not yet ratified the Statute\nto do so to enable it to enter into force.\nThe proliferation of conventional weapons,\nnotably small arms and light weapons, has been of\ngreat concern to the Government and the people of\nGhana. They are now the weapons of choice and the\ntools for promoting violence and conflicts in Africa.\nSuch weapons have always been used against the most\nvulnerable in society, especially women and children.\nWe therefore welcome the Programme of Action\nadopted at the recent United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects. While it does not respond to all of our\nconcerns or meet all of our expectations, we still\nconsider it to be the beginning of a process that will\nlead to an internationally binding instrument on\nmanaging and controlling such weapons.\nConflicts, particularly in the developing world,\nhave robbed us of the opportunity to improve the\ncircumstances of our people. Sustainable development\ncan be achieved only in an environment of peace and\nsecurity. Ghana will continue to live up to its Charter\nobligations and to play an active role in international\npeacekeeping, with a view to assisting the United\nNations in its task of maintaining global peace and\nsecurity.\nOnly a year ago, world leaders, at the Millennium\nSummit, committed themselves to providing leadership\nto create a better world, one which would uphold\nhuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level,\nthrough the elimination of poverty and the creation of a\nconducive environment for development.\nTo achieve this, it is imperative that the\ninternational community take steps to assist countries\nthat have created the necessary environment for sound\neconomic development. This will enable them to reach\ntheir potential for sustained growth through conducive\npolicies concerning debt, market access, transfer of\ntechnology, increased flows of capital and foreign\ndirect investment, and enhanced official development\nassistance.\nIt is important, particularly at this moment when\nthe fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization is taking place in Doha, to emphasize the\ncritical role of global trade in generating the resources\nfor financing development in developing countries. The\noutcome of the Doha Conference, our commitment to\npursuing the decisions and processes emanating from\nthat Conference, the implementation of the\ncommitments made in the Uruguay Round and how we\naddress intellectual property rights should clearly\ndetermine our commitment to eradicating poverty\nthroughout the world.\nWe believe that the success of our efforts at the\nglobal level will depend largely on the quality of\ngovernance in our respective countries. We cannot\nclaim to uphold the dignity of every human being or\nmake claims to social equity if we fail to uphold\ndemocracy and the rule of law, combat corruption and\nstrengthen the institutions of governance. It is therefore\ngratifying to note that in the past few years democracy\nhas begun to take root in Africa. This trend should be\nencouraged and consolidated with support from the\ninternational community.\nIt is for this reason that Ghana fully endorsed the\nConstitutive Act of the African Union, which, among\nother things, rejects unconstitutional changes of\nGovernment and reaffirms respect for democratic\nprinciples, human rights, the rule of law and good\ngovernance. The decisions we took in Lusaka during\nthe last summit of the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) on the African Union and the New Partnership\nfor African Development have reasserted Africa\u2019s\nleadership and responsibility for the continent\u2019s\ndevelopment agenda. Ghana intends to play its part\nthrough positive diplomacy and cooperation with other\nAfrican countries to accelerate regional integration and\nmake Africa a zone of economic empowerment.\nAfrica accepts its primary responsibility for its\nown development. However, the contribution of its\ndevelopment partners will continue to be crucial. In\nthis connection, the outcomes of the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Monterrey, Mexico, and of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\nJohannesburg, will be critical tests of our willingness\n25\n\nto tackle concretely the challenges we set for ourselves\nin the Millennium Declaration.\nAt the onset of the new millennium, we hope that\ngender issues will continue to engage the attention of\nthe international community. The adoption of the\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action, in 1995,\nand the subsequent adoption of further actions and\ninitiatives by the twenty-third special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, last year, indicate the universal\nrecognition of the need to empower women as partners\nin socio-economic development. As a result of the\ngreat importance that Ghana attaches to the\nadvancement of women, our Government has elevated\nthe national machinery for the advancement of women\ninto a full-fledged ministry headed by a cabinet\nminister. We are determined, through practical\nmeasures, to make our women full and effective\npartners in the development of our country.\nGhana welcomes the remarkable success achieved\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session with\nthe adoption, after protracted negotiations, of the\nresolutions on the scale of assessments for the regular\nand peacekeeping budgets. It is therefore our\nconsidered view that both resolutions should ensure the\nfinancial solvency and viability of the Organization.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reassure the Assembly of\nGhana\u2019s abiding commitment to the United Nations and\nits ideals. The Organization is the best means available\nfor maintaining international peace and security and\npromoting fruitful international cooperation. We must\nall resolve to strengthen our will to make it more\neffective and to redeem the majority of our people from\nwars, disease and poverty by providing it with financial\nand material resources commensurate with its\nresponsibilities.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSamoa is very pleased\nthat we are meeting under the presidency of Mr. Han.\nOn behalf of my Government, I extend warm\ncongratulations to the President of the General\nAssembly and express to him our full confidence and\ncooperation.\nAllow me also a moment to pay tribute to his\npredecessor, President Harri Holkeri, for his\n8\n\noutstanding service and leadership during the fifty-fifth\nsession of the General Assembly, and for the\nsignificant achievements of that session.\nWe are delighted with the award of the Nobel\nPeace Prize to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nand to our Organization. I want, in particular, to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and to wish him\nevery success in his new term of office. His personal\nqualities and extraordinary leadership give shape to the\nmodern face of the United Nations in ways that give\nforce and credibility to the Organization and its\nperformance.\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September marked a\nturning point in the history of our era. These terrible\nevents give special significance to this session of the\nAssembly. We need to send out from this house an\nunambiguous message.\nThe clear view of my Government is that there is\nno room for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking\nof innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or\ngrievance, is without justification in law and is morally\nunacceptable. My Government has declared its strong\ncondemnation of the attacks in New York, Washington,\nD.C., and Pennsylvania, and I want today to underscore\nthat condemnation in unequivocal terms.\nOn behalf of my country and its citizens, I want\nto renew to the Government and the people of the\nUnited States our profound feelings of sorrow and\nsympathy and our committed solidarity and support. I\nalso want to say that the leadership, magnificent\nexample and courage shown by the United States\ndemonstrate beyond doubt the extraordinary strengths\nof that great democracy and the indomitable spirit of its\npeople.\nThis was a most monstrous crime, evil in\npremeditation and merciless in execution. Thousands\nof innocent lives were taken, thousands of people\nmurdered without warning. To the families and friends\nof the victims \u2014 which included citizens of many other\ncountries represented in this Hall \u2014 we extend our\nwarm and heartfelt condolences.\nTerrorism is an offence against the core values of\nthe United Nations. It is a direct and most serious\nthreat to democracy, to the free exercise of human\nrights and to economic and social development. It has\nno respect for social order, human life and property.\nThis has never been clearer than in the aftermath\nof these terrible attacks against the United States.\nFurthermore, these horrific events not only have served\nto highlight the need for a concerted and effective\ninternational response but have also drawn attention to\nthe inadequacy of the traditional forms of judicial and\nlaw enforcement in combating it.\nThere cannot be any question as to the need for\nan effective response from the international\ncommunity. Indeed, the Security Council\u2019s unanimous\nand momentous resolution 1373 (2001), together with\nresolution 1368 (2001), gives the clearest signal of the\ninternational community\u2019s determination to take\nconcrete action against the financing, training and\nmovement of terrorists and the need for all States to\ncooperate in any campaign against them. We believe\nthey provide the necessary basis for securing the\nbroadest possible international support and cooperation\nfor the global campaign against terrorism, in particular\nthrough the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.\nI am pleased to announce that as part of its own\nresponse in this collective effort, Samoa is taking steps\nto adhere to additional United Nations conventions on\ninternational terrorism.\nWe believe, however, that we need to bear in\nmind that fighting terrorism cannot be separated from\nthe task of preventing organized crime and the spread\nof small arms and other weapons, and of containing\nand ending conflict. We also need to ensure that the\nconditions of poverty and despair, which breed\nignorance, hatred, violence and extremism, are\nproperly and effectively addressed.\nWe need, above all, to remain resolute in\nupholding the rule of law and the principles that\nunderpin the rule of law. The clear affirmation of these\nprinciples and of the norms of humanitarian and\ninternational law will help deny to the perpetrators of\nthese crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence.\nWe consider it essential to renew efforts to\npromote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute\nof the International Criminal Court. A functioning\ninternational criminal court for the prosecution of\nterrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity \u2014\nas we consider the attacks on the United States to be \u2014\nwould provide a vital component in the international\narmoury against terrorism.\n9\n\nThis fifty-sixth session of the Assembly is the\nfirst to follow last year\u2019s Millennium Summit. It will\nbe the ideal occasion to take up the critical issues and\nstrategies for implementing the Millennium\nDeclaration. May I say in this connection that we\nwarmly welcome and find most useful the road map\nreport of the Secretary-General, setting out in some\ndetail how the Summit commitments could be fulfilled.\nWe note that most of the targets set by the\nMillennium Declaration are not really new. They are\nthe determined results of global conferences of the\n1990s or are derived from the body of international\nnorms and laws that have been codified over the past\n50 years. It follows that the plans of action needed for\nreaching the targets have, for the most part, already\nbeen developed and formally adopted by Member\nStates.\nWhat is needed, therefore, is not more technical\nor feasibility studies. Rather, as the Secretary-General\u2019s\nreport points out, States need to demonstrate the\npolitical will to carry out commitments already made\nand to implement strategies already worked out. In\nother words, as we move from an era of commitment to\nan era of implementation, the international community\nmust mobilize the will and the resources needed to\nfulfil the promises made.\nSamoa was honoured recently to host a Pacific\nregional meeting as part of the preparatory work for the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg next September. It is important to seek\nfurther progress in these preparations, especially in the\ncompletion of national assessment reports. We believe\nthe Summit will be a unique opportunity to re-establish\ninternational commitment to sustainable development.\nOur own view is that there is a need to accelerate the\ncomprehensive and targeted implementation of Agenda\n21. Efforts to this end should aim to minimize and\nremove obstacles that impede the implementation of\nthe Rio commitments, especially in capacity-building\nneeds and in the provision of adequate financial and\ntechnological support.\nWe place particular importance on the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment. The agenda of the Conference allows for\na full range of substantive issues to be addressed. It\nwould be important to forge broad-based consensus on\nall these issues, and even more so on the reform of the\ninternational financial and trade architecture in a way\nthat would be supportive of the long-term development\nof developing countries. There should be enhanced\nopportunities for the representation and participation of\ndeveloping countries, including small island States, in\nthe major decision-making institutions on global\nfinancing, monetary and trade issues.\nIt is impossible today to visualize progress and\ndevelopment without access to modern information\nsystems. The remarkable growth of information and\ncommunication technologies (ICT) is opening up\nboundless new possibilities for accelerated economic\nand social development. But the ability to translate the\nfull potential of ICT differs from country to country. I\nknow my country needs to develop its own capacity to\ndo so. Yet we know that, for a developing country like\nmy own, there is no real option but to take full\nadvantage of the digital revolution. We will therefore\nbe supporting every global effort to call attention to the\nneed for bridging the digital divide.\nThe turn of the millennium has brought new\nchallenges, and with it changes to the character and\ncomplexity of the United Nations role in maintaining\ninternational peace and security. Samoa is proud to\nhave been able to contribute to the civilian police\noperations in East Timor. From this experience it is\nclear to us that if the United Nations is to do its job of\nmaintaining international peace and security, it needs to\nbe given the necessary tools and resources.\nWe have learned a great deal from the report of\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, and we\nknow that the United Nations needs to improve its\ncapacity to respond to conflicts more effectively. And\nwe need to move forward with the peacekeeping\nreform process.\nThe recognition implicit in the awarding of the\nNobel Peace Prize to the United Nations means that\nmore than ever, we need to modernize and strengthen\nour Organization. We fully support the current efforts\nto review and revitalize the working methods of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe commend most highly the work of the\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s Open-ended Working Group on\nreform of the Security Council and its Bureau. Difficult\nand critical issues remain. But we need to maintain the\npolitical momentum provided in the Millennium\nSummit for comprehensive reform of the Security\nCouncil. Membership of the Council, both permanent\nand non-permanent, needs to be enlarged to reflect the\n10\n\nrealities of the present time and to enhance its role and\neffectiveness.\nFinally, let me refer to the twenty-second special\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1999, that\nreviewed the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. Since that time, a number of global events, such\nas the tenth session of the United Nations Conference\non Trade and Development and the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\nhave recalled the fragility of small island States in the\nglobalizing economy. We, of course, are grateful for\nthis acknowledgement. However, I believe I reflect the\naspiration of all small island States in saying that we\nneed to do much more in terms of concrete actions -\nactions that will only be meaningful if we are assured\nof the committed support of the whole international\ncommunity.\nOvercoming the well-recognized vulnerability of\nsmall island States like my own, and the exposure of\nisland communities to the effects of global climate\nchange, natural disasters, environmental damage and\nglobal economic shocks will be an essential element of\nsustainable development in all small island regions.\nMay I say, in this connection, that Samoa very\nmuch welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday in\nMarrakech of the seventh session of the Conference of\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The completion of the\noperational details of the Kyoto Protocol will, we hope,\nopen the way to widespread ratification by\nGovernments and the Protocol\u2019 s early entry into force,\nperhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summit\nnext year.\nThe struggle against climate change is not just an\nenvironmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamental\ndevelopment. It is so because the adverse impact of\nclimate change endangers economic and social\nprogress. This is most certainly the case for small\nisland States, which are widely acknowledged to be\namong the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt.\nThe world community\u2019s response to climate change\ntherefore requires significant, long-term changes in\neconomic and social behaviour. The United Nations has\nan urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI am\nagain the last speaker of the day, but I am happy\nbecause it gives me a little extra time to congratulate\nthe President on the effective manner in which he is\nconducting the work of the session, which gives us\nevery reason to believe that it will be steered to a\nfruitful conclusion.\nI wish also to extend our heartfelt condolences\nand sympathy to the families of the plane crash victims\nof yesterday. Let us pray that it had nothing to do with\nterrorist acts, as the tragic events of 11 September\nalone were more than enough to bring to the fore the\nfight against terrorism as one of the top priorities of the\nUnited Nations and the international community.\nCognizant of the distinction between terrorism and the\nstruggle to exercise a people\u2019s right to self-\ndetermination, Viet Nam persistently condemns\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, which\ntakes a heavy toll of innocent lives. We fully support\nthe international endeavour and cooperation to ensure\nworld peace, stability and security in full conformity\nwith the United Nations Charter and with fundamental\nprinciples of international law, particularly those\nrespecting national independence and sovereignty. No\nindividual country can go solo or have double\nstandards in this fight. While members of the\ninternational community must act in a responsible\nmanner by not tolerating, nurturing and/or supporting\nterrorists on their soil, they should also bring the\nterrorists to justice or extradite them to the country\nwhere their crimes were committed, so that they can be\nduly punished.\nThough combating international terrorism has\nbecome the pressing task of the day, it must not\novershadow the challenges of the twenty-first century.\nPoverty, the widened development gap, the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic, the deteriorating environment, regional\ntensions and conflicts, all point to the potential\ninstability of the world today, as mentioned by our\nleaders a year ago. The Summit Declaration, in\nreflecting the genuine wishes and resolve of the\nworld\u2019s peoples, vigorously reconfirmed the values and\nprinciples of the Charter, defining the priority\nobjectives of the United Nations and the international\ncommunity for the years to come, thus becoming our\nplatform, our programme of action for the new\nmillennium. To implement the Declaration at the global\nlevel, the United Nations last year conducted numerous\nactivities, including the organization of a series of\nspecial sessions in the economic, social and security\nfields. The international organizations in the United\nNations system \u2014 such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) \u2014\nare actively coordinating with nations to incorporate in\ntheir national programmes the specific objectives set\nforth in the Summit Declaration. This is a significant\nstart which should be further promoted, as the most\npressing challenge to us all is how to eradicate poverty\non a global scale. In this spirit we wish to congratulate\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who started his\nsecond term in office with the Nobel Peace Prize. We\nare fully convinced that the Secretary-General will\ncontinue to contribute to the cause of all nations and\npeoples.\nAgainst the backdrop of globalization\nspearheaded by the information technology revolution,\nthe other side of international political and economic\nlife has been further exposed. The gap between rich\nand poor has widened further, and adverse\ncircumstances in international relations have emerged,\nfurther underscoring the disadvantage and vulnerability\nof the developing countries. The Secretary-General\nonce said words to the effect that poverty and the gap\nbetween rich and poor are the seeds of instability and\nprecarious development, and that today\u2019s main\nchallenge is how to ensure that globalization becomes\nthe driving force of development instead of leaving a\nbillion people in abject poverty. A common concern at\npresent, however, is the tendency towards decreasing\nofficial development assistance (ODA), particularly the\ndecrease in contributions to the development\norganizations in the United Nations system, which will\nsurely hamper their activities. More than ever before,\nthe United Nations, the international community, the\ndeveloped countries in particular, should further assist\nthe developing countries in the eradication of poverty,\ndisease and illiteracy, and facilitate their fuller and\nequitable participation in international economic life.\nDevelopment requires an environment of peace\nand stability. But complex implications arising from\nthe conflicts in some parts of the world and the\npossible intensification of an arms race, are not\nconducive to development at all. Of particular concern\nis the escalation of violence in the Middle East. We\njoin the community of world peoples calling for an\n42\n\nearly end to violence, the resumption of peaceful\nnegotiations for a just, long-lasting solution in which\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the\nlegitimate rights of all parties concerned, would be\nguaranteed. By the same token, the embargoes imposed\nupon Cuba, Iraq and Libya, which cause untold\nsuffering to these peoples, should be lifted so as to\nenable them to concentrate their energy and efforts on\nnational reconstruction and development.\nThis year, South-East Asia has witnessed certain\ncomplex developments, but peace, stability and\ncooperation remain the burning aspiration of our\npeoples and continue to be the main tendency. The\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\ncountries are determined to build a zone of peace,\ndevelopment and prosperity and to coordinate efforts to\neffectively cope with regional and global challenges. In\nthat context, the success of the 34th Ministerial\nMeeting, the eighth ASEAN Regional Forum held in\nHanoi last August and the ASEAN Summit held in\nBrunei Darussalam in early November, all contributed\nto establishing priorities and effective measures for the\nfuture of this region. These meetings reaffirmed\nASEAN\u2019s determination to further promote solidarity,\ncooperation, dialogue and mutual understanding within\nASEAN, and between ASEAN countries and their\ndialogue partners, especially China, Japan and the\nRepublic of Korea, for the peaceful settlement of their\ndifferences on the basis of respect for fundamental\nprinciples and norms of international law, particularly\nthose regarding consensus and non-interference in the\ninternal affairs of others. The Hanoi Declaration on\nNarrowing the Development Gap for Closer ASEAN\nIntegration and other important documents were\nadopted on confidence-building and the promotion of\nmutual understanding for peace and stability in South-\nEast Asia, as well as in Asia and the Pacific. They\nwelcomed the promising progress in the ASEAN-China\nconsultation regarding a code of conduct in the Eastern\nSea, reaffirming those principles of the 1992 ASEAN\nManila Declaration on the settlement of conflicting\nclaims of territorial sovereignty in the Eastern Sea. We\nsincerely hope that the United Nations and the\ninternational community, in line with the Millennium\nDeclaration, will deliver active support and assistance\nto the implementation of our regional cooperation for\npeace, stability and development in the region and\nthroughout the world.\nIn the course of 15 years of rebuilding, Viet Nam\nhas recorded great achievements in all fields. The ninth\nParty Congress has drawn necessary lessons from our\nown experiences, reaffirmed our resolve to continue the\ncourse, stepping up industrialization and modernization\nprogrammes, and mapping out the socio-economic\ndevelopment strategy for the years 2001 to 2010. While\ntrying to bring into full play our inner strength, we will\ncreate more favourable conditions to attract investment\nand expand further effective cooperation with foreign\npartners and countries. We will continue to pursue our\nforeign policy of independence, openness, international\neconomic integration, friendship and trusted\npartnership with all countries in the international\ncommunity in the endeavour for peace, independence\nand development.\nThe Millennium Summit and its Declaration\nprovided us with a momentum in the new millennium,\nwhich should be maintained through the active\nimplementation of the guidelines unanimously\nendorsed by our leaders. The United Nations and each\nMember State should make efforts to achieve those\nobjectives.\nIn order to contribute effectively to the common\ncause, the United Nations should speed up the process\nof reform, renovation and democratization. Viet Nam\nfully supports the central role of the General Assembly,\nthe highest representative body of the whole\nmembership, and the reform and expansion of the\nSecurity Council in both the non-permanent and\npermanent categories. The developing countries should\nhave fuller representation and participation in the\nCouncil\u2019s decision-making. But it is of the utmost\nimportance that the United Nations should design\nmeasures to concentrate resources for development and\nthe eradication of poverty and for the other major\nobjectives included in the Millennium Declaration. It is\nthe expectation of the whole membership that the\nUnited Nations should become a worthy world body,\noperating in a more effective manner in the interests of\nall countries and for a just, humanistic and better world\nin the new millennium. We believe that the United\nNations will surely live up to this expectation and Viet\nNam pledges to contribute actively to this common\nendeavour."

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\nis for me a signal honour to take the floor today before\nthe Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. On behalf of my\ndelegation, I wish at the outset to express my sincere\ncongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic\nof Korea on his well-deserved election to the\npresidency of this body of the United Nations. We\nbelieve that his vast experience, his dynamism and his\ncompetence guarantee the success of our work at this\nsession. He can count on my delegation to be fully\navailable to him. We will spare no effort to facilitate\nhis work so that his noble mission can be carried out to\nthe fullest.\nAllow me next to pay sincere tribute to Mr. Harri\nHolkeri for the way he acquitted himself in his term of\noffice leading the work at our last session. We all\nappreciated his many talents as a statesman and\nseasoned diplomat, which in large measure contributed\nto bringing the work of that session to a successful\nconclusion.\nI should like, finally, to avail myself of this\nfelicitous opportunity to convey the greetings of the\nBurundian people to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations, and to express to him\nonce again my heartfelt congratulations on his\nunanimous re-election to the helm of the Organization\nfor a second term of office. At the same time, I address\nto him my warmest congratulations on the Nobel Peace\nPrize just awarded to him and to the United Nations\nitself. This token of renewed confidence is a striking\nexpression of recognition of the United Nations\nfamily\u2019s tireless efforts in every corner of the world for\nthe cause of peace and development. My Government\nis particularly obliged to the Secretary-General for his\npersonal commitment to helping the people of Burundi\nemerge from crisis so that through the ongoing peace\nprocess they can resume the path of peace,\nreconciliation and development.\nAll of us were shocked and horrified by the\nmurderous attacks perpetrated here in New York,\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September\n2001. My Government firmly condemned those odious\nterrorist acts, characterized by indescribable barbarity.\nThe President of the Republic of Burundi, Mr. Pierre\nBuyoya, dispatched a message of condolence to\n22\n\nPresident George W. Bush immediately after the tragic\nevents had been reported.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 mark a new\nglobal challenge for the United Nations in its resolute\nfight against terrorism and for maintaining\ninternational peace and security. The Government of\nthe Republic of Burundi fully subscribes to the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations on the fight against\nterrorism. Committed to the ideals of peace and\nsecurity the world over, it intends to make its own\ncontribution to building a world from which\ninternational terrorism will be banished. Towards that\nend, Burundi endorses the various international\nconventions against international terrorism. It has\nalready ratified three of them, and this morning we\nsigned the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted in\n1999. The necessary steps will be taken to sign and\nratify the remaining conventions. Burundi hails the\nadoption by the Security Council of its resolution 1373\n(2001) and stands committed to examining in depth its\nscope of application on our own national territory.\nIn light of the plethora of sophisticated juridical\nprovisions \u2014 extant for nearly 30 years now \u2014 to fight\nagainst this scourge, a profound awareness and far\nmore sustained collective action today is imperative.\nThe Government of Burundi agrees with the content of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which\nemphasizes:\n\u201c... the need to enhance coordination of efforts on\nnational, subregional, regional and international\nlevels in order to strengthen a global response to\nthis serious challenge and threat to international\nsecurity\u201d (S/RES/1373 (2001), op. para. 4).\nThat global response obviously, and as a matter of\npriority, is an imperative for us, the Members of this\ninstitution, the United Nations, on which the Charter\nexplicitly confers the role of maintaining international\npeace and security.\nAs to the situation in my own country, Burundi,\nthe present session is being held at a time when the\npeace process has just completed a particularly\ndecisive phase. Indeed the Arusha Peace Accord,\nwhich Burundi signed on 28 August 2000, has begun to\nbe resolutely implemented. May I be allowed to bring\nto the attention of the distinguished representatives\ngathered here certain major developments worthy of\nbeing emphasized. After a number of consultations\nheld among the signatories to the Peace Agreement,\nand after the Facilitation and Regional Initiative, the\nmatter of the transitional leadership for the next three\nyears has been settled. On 1 November 2001, the\nsolemn inauguration of the President and Vice-\nPresident of the Republic and the transitional\nGovernment was held.\nI wish to make a point of expressing the very\nsincere thanks of the Government and people of\nBurundi to the heads of State and other eminent\npersonalities that elevated those ceremonies by their\npresence.\nAt this important stage in the peace process, I\nshould like to take care of a pleasant duty, namely that\nof paying tribute first to the late Mwalimu Julius\nNyerere, who was the first to play a mediator\u2019s role in\nthe inter-Burundian peace process in an extremely\ndelicate setting. Secondly, I wish to make it a point\nsolemnly to hail the courage, vision, perseverance and\ntact that His Excellency the former President Nelson\nMandela displayed throughout the inter-Burundian\nnegotiations so as to help the Burundian people regain\nthe path to peace, reconciliation and democracy. From\nthis lofty tribune I wish to express to him our feelings\nof profound gratitude. We feel the same sentiments of\nsincere appreciation to the United Nations and all\ncountries and personalities that have worked from near\nor afar to see to the signing of the Peace Accord,\npeople who continue to invest of themselves in order to\nsee the Agreement fully implemented. It is thanks to all\nthese pooled efforts that some glimmer of hope is\nperceptible in the Burundian political skies.\nThe new Government has set itself as a priority\ntask halting the war, rehabilitating victims and\nrestoring the country in socio-economic terms.\nNotwithstanding, however, our firm determination to\nmove forward, the programme continues to encounter\nenormous challenges, challenges such as the\npersistence of war and the exacerbation of poverty.\nWith regard to the war, we must deplore the fact that\narmed groups continue to sow grief and desolation in\nvarious parts of the country, pursuing a nameless war, a\nwar that is killing innocents in their homes, in the\ncamps for displaced persons and along the roads, a war\nthat favours pillaging and rape and that has destroyed\nsocial and economic infrastructures built at great cost.\nWe denounce and condemn in the strongest terms this\nnew type of violence, namely the seizing of school\n23\n\nchildren by rebel elements to press-gang them into\nguerrilla forces or to have them do their dirty deeds.\nIn this context the priority of all priorities for my\ncountry thus remains the quest for a ceasefire, which\nwould make it possible to begin the major reforms\nenvisaged during the transitional period.\nNotwithstanding numerous initiatives directed by our\nGovernment towards the armed groups \u2014 the Conseil\nnational pour la d\u00e9fense de d\u00e9mocratie-Forces pour la\nd\u00e9fense de d\u00e9mocratie (CNDD-FDD), and the Forces\nnationales de la lib\u00e9ration (FNL) \u2014 inviting them to\nsubscribe to the peace process and join in negotiations,\nas yet there is no sign of a firm, formal commitment on\ntheir part that would allow us to move forward in that\ndirection. Nonetheless we feel that these armed groups\nno longer have political claims that they can truly\nbrandish, given the fact that the Arusha Accords\nenvisage their participation in transitional institutions,\ntheir recruitment into defence and security corps and\ntheir social and professional reintegration if they so\ndesire.\nWhile thanking our partners for the variety of\ninitiatives already launched to bring the Burundian\nrebels into the peace process, I should like once again\nto call upon all the countries members of the Regional\nInitiative, the Facilitation in the inter-Burundian\nnegotiations, the Organization of African Unity, the\nUnited Nations, and the rest of the international\ncommunity to continue to bring pressure to bear upon\nthese armed groups so that they will lay down their\narms and rejoin other Burundians around the\nnegotiating table without further delay, in conformity\nwith Security Council resolution 1375 (2001), adopted\non 29 October 2001, and other resolutions of the\nCouncil. We particularly ask for the invaluable help of\nthe countries in our subregion, all of them co-\nsignatories to the Arusha Accords, so that all the\nnecessary steps will be taken to stop these armed\ngroups from attacking Burundi. Notwithstanding these\nvarious initiatives, if the rebels continue obstinately to\nrefuse dialogue, my Government will call upon the\ninternational community and all parties signatories to\nthe Arusha Accords to do all they possibly can to\nneutralize and disarm the FDD and FNL and, at the\nsame time, the other negative forces allied to them.\nThe continuing deterioration in the socio-\neconomic situation in my country constitutes yet\nanother source of major concern for the new\ngovernment team. Indeed, eight years of the worst kind\nof fratricidal war, together with three years of\nunjustified economic embargo, from July 1996 to\nJanuary 1999, have plunged the country into a state of\nextreme poverty which will be difficult to overcome.\nWhat is more, international cooperation since 1996 has,\nas it were, been frozen, thus confronting us with a lack\nof foreign exchange and a major erosion of our\nmonetary situation. Furthermore, in the year 2000,\neconomic activity continued to suffer from the heavy\nblows of drought, bringing about negative growth for\ntwo consecutive years in an essentially agricultural\ncountry.\nOver the same crisis period, the situation with\nregard to health has significantly deteriorated.\nNotwithstanding efforts exerted by my Government,\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases such as those\nlinked to malnutrition, continue to rage among our\npeople, already weakened by the horrors of war. The\nmajor performance indicators for education reflect a\nnet decline. Access to drinking water and general\nhygiene conditions have seriously deteriorated at a\ntime when many of our dwellings and the basic social\ninfrastructure, such as schools and health centres, have\nbeen destroyed by war.\nFaced with a particularly trying situation,\nBurundi looks for a great deal from the United Nations\nand its agencies, its various bilateral partners,\ninternational organizations and non-governmental\norganizations to help our economy to recover, in the\nname of international solidarity and for the benefit of\nour people plunged today into a state of unprecedented\npoverty. I thus urgently appeal to my country\u2019s various\npartners to make tangible the reality of the promises\nmade at the Pledging Conference for Burundi, held in\nParis from 11 to 12 December 2000, for the purpose of\nrebuilding and helping the recovery of our economy. A\nround table following through on these commitments\nmade at that Conference is to be organized in Geneva\nin December 2001. The Government of Burundi counts\non the active participation of our partners, particularly\nin making available the aid promised.\nOn the international scene the delegation of\nBurundi hopes to see the implementation of the\nprovisions of the Millennium Declaration adopted last\nyear by the heads of State and Government of Member\nStates of the Organization. It particularly supports the\nreforming of the Security Council and welcomes the\nfact that this matter already enjoys the broad-ranging\nbacking of the Members of the United Nations. It\n24\n\nregrets nonetheless that discussions on the modalities\nthat the reform is to take are at an impasse, and this,\neight years after the establishment of the Working\nGroup under General Assembly resolution 48/26,\nadopted on 3 December 1993. My delegation,\nnotwithstanding all that, remains confident that the\nwork of the Working Group concerned will be quickly\nconcluded, the results being of the keenest interest in\nterms, once again, of galvanizing this major body.\nBurundi wishes to draw the attention of the\nAssembly to the problems that have grown more and\nmore serious and alarming because of the accumulation\nand excessive and destabilizing proliferation of small\narms and light weapons and the arms race. In this\nconnection it is ever more necessary and urgent to\ndevelop and effectively implement specific\ndisarmament programmes. We welcome the adoption of\nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\nWeapons in All Its Aspects at the United Nations\nConference, held from 9 to 20 July 2001, here in New\nYork. Our surest hope is for that Programme to be\neffectively implemented to relieve the suffering of\npeople in the regions where this kind of weaponry\ncontinues to take the lives of thousands of innocent\npeople. What is more, the Government of Burundi\nremains devoted to the goal of the total elimination of\nweapons of mass destruction, whether they be nuclear,\nchemical or biological.\nTo have peace and security prevail required\nadopting a working strategy for conflict prevention,\nwith a view to understanding fully the motives and\ndynamics of confrontation and to curing this evil at its\nroot. It also means resolutely attacking the structural\ncauses that drive people to revolt, namely ignorance,\nwant, disease, extreme poverty, underdevelopment and\nits corollaries, and inequities in the distribution of\nwealth. There is a chain directly linking desperate acts\nand the fanaticism bred of frustration and humiliation.\nThus, the imbalance between the North and the South\nis unlikely to promote harmonious equilibrium. Indeed,\non the basis of available statistics, more than one third\nof mankind lives in absolute poverty. This is liable to\ngrow worse if the rich countries continue not to\nshoulder their responsibilities in terms of aid for\ndevelopment.\nImproving the living conditions of people\ncontributes, through its induced effects, to reducing\nother anachronistic factors growing out of poverty,\nsuch as the child labour ban by International Labour\nOrganization (ILO) conventions and the spread of the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. My delegation continues to hope\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, scheduled for March 2002 in Mexico,\nwill adopt strategies to reduce these inequalities\nbetween and within countries. It expects from that\nConference a definition of the strategic objectives in\nterms of consistent policies for integrating developing\ncountries into the global economy, whatever their level\nof development.\nAs to globalization, many indeed are those that\ndenounce its perverse effects, as witness the clashes in\nSeattle and Genoa. In this context, we are duty-bound\nto see to it that globalization becomes a positive force\nfor all mankind in the best interests of all. Yet another\nissue of concern to my delegation continues to be that\nof human dignity, which cannot be conceived as\ndivorced from respect for human rights, including that\nof self-determination. Towards that end, the delegation\nof Burundi continues to hope that the Second\nInternational Decade for the Elimination of\nColonialism, from 2001 to 2010, proclaimed by the\nAssembly by its resolution 55/146 of 8 December\n2000, will help to eradicate its last bastions.\nIt is impossible to talk about international\nconcord without calling to mind the right to justice,\ngenuine justice and real fairness in the settlement of\ndisputes. On that score my delegation would like yet\nagain to reiterate the importance the Government of\nBurundi ascribes to the International Criminal Court,\nregarding which preliminary steps towards ratification\nare being taken. Indeed, my delegation shares the same\nconviction as the Secretary-General of our\nOrganization, Mr. Kofi Annan, when he affirms that we\nmust build a world where order and justice reign in\nterms of respect for the primacy of law in international\nrelations.\nThe challenges confronting the international\ncommunity are multiple and take many forms. The\nefficacy of the Organization will be judged by its\nability to keep cohesion intact and to promote people\u2019s\nholistic development, so as to fashion a world where all\ncan realize their potential and where we all espouse\npeace, fraternity and equality. We are all called upon to\nstrive towards the realization of that noble cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, it is a great pleasure for me to congratulate the\nPresident on his election, which is a sign of the esteem\nin which he and his country are held.\nComing after his re-election to a second term \u2500\nwhich is a sign of the general confidence he has\nearned \u2500 the Nobel Peace Prize that has been awarded\nto the Secretary-General is a well-deserved tribute to\nhis work and, through him, to the United Nations\nOrganization as a whole, thereby inspiring greater hope\nthan ever before.\nOn this my third visit to New York since the\ntragedy of 11 September, I also want to express once\nagain my profound emotion and pay homage to the\npeople of New York, who are being so severely tested,\nand to their courageous mayor, who is now finishing\nhis term.\nThe unprecedented magnitude and gravity of the\nterrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11\nSeptember warrant our unfailing solidarity and an\nexceptional response. In its resolution 1368 (2001),\nwhich was adopted unanimously, the Security Council\nrightly qualified those acts as attacks and, hence, as\nlegitimately meriting a defensive response under\nArticle 51 of the Charter. The United States is thus\nentirely within its legal and political rights in carrying\nout its targeted military response against the terrorist\norganizations responsible for those acts. The military\naction under way was therefore inevitable, and must be\npursued until all its objectives have been achieved.\nGiven the preliminary results achieved yesterday, I\nhope that those objectives will be met as soon as\npossible. The leaders of these terrorist networks and\nthose who support them must be decisively prevented\nfrom committing further harm.\nBut that military action should, as a matter of\ncourse, form part of an overarching strategy that\nincludes immediate, broad-scale humanitarian action\nthat is better adapted to the needs of people in distress.\nFrance has put forward several proposals in this regard\nand supports the current initiatives for better\ncoordination. That overarching strategy should also\ninclude a political solution \u2014 something that has now\nbecome urgent \u2014 and strive to ensure that the demise\nof the Taliban regime does not lead to factional\ninfighting and chaos; and it must once again make the\nAfghan people masters of their own future. That is the\naim of the action plan for Afghanistan that France\nproposed back on 1 October, and of the other\ncontributions it has made with the same goals in mind.\nWe await Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi\u2019s proposals with\ninterest; they should set forth broad outlines of action\nfor the United Nations. On these bases, the Security\nCouncil should be able to adopt a framework resolution\nwithin a few days, endorsing Mr. Brahimi\u2019s proposals\nand spelling out the modalities of United Nations\nsupport for the establishment of an Afghan\n26\n\nGovernment representative of the various constituents\nof the population. There is no question of imposing on\nAfghanistan some ready-made solution concocted by\noutsiders. I call on all the constituents of the Afghan\nnation and all neighbouring countries to heed the\ngeneral interest of Afghanistan and its people. This is\ncompatible with respect for the legitimate interests of\nthe various parties concerned and it is the only way to\nturn our backs on the past.\nBeyond immediate military, diplomatic and\nhumanitarian action, our common fight against\nterrorism needs to be pursued in all its forms, including\npolice, judicial and others. The United Nations will\nhave a crucial role to play in this difficult struggle,\nlaying down universal obligations for each State and\nthe framework for our action. A series of conventions\nhas already been concluded, particularly the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which I proposed in this very\nplace in 1999. We must speed up the signature and\nratification of those conventions. The General\nAssembly must quickly conclude the negotiations on\nthe comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism. For its part, the Security Council should\noversee the coordinated implementation by States of its\nresolution 1373 (2001).\nAction against terrorism also needs to be carried\nout through other organizations, in conjunction with\nthe United Nations and consistent with its policies. For\nits part, the European Union (EU) has just taken\nunprecedented steps to strengthen police and judicial\ncooperation among its member States, including the\ncreation of a European arrest warrant. An ambitious\naction plan has been agreed. The 29 members of the\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) have decided to\nextend the fight against money-laundering to the fight\nagainst the financing of terrorism. Beyond that, I\npropose the creation of a dialogue forum to move us in\nthis direction. Several other organizations, too, will\nhave a role to play, so that at the end of the day every\ncountry will be making a contribution.\nLeaving aside the hoped-for short-term results,\nthe obstacles notwithstanding, we will not achieve\nlasting victory against all forms of terrorism unless we\nsucceed in depriving terrorists of their breeding ground\nand eliminating the pretexts from which they\nfallaciously draw their justification, and unless we\neradicate them in the true sense of the term. That\nimplies nothing short of changing our world. And let\nno one claim that this would be tantamount to\njustifying the terrorists. For neither my country, nor\nEurope, nor the United Nations \u2014 in other words, none\nof us \u2014 waited for 11 September to discover, condemn\nand seek to remedy the ills of the world. Yet how many\ngood intentions have come to naught? How many\nresolutions have gone unimplemented? How many\nannouncements have failed to materialize, which now\nfeed a sense of bitterness and incomprehension? It is\npointless to condemn or deny the theory of a clash of\ncivilizations. Rather, we must fight against such a risk,\nwhich is by no means wholly imaginary, and against\nthose who would make it a reality.\nThis should be one more pressing reason for us\nall to find a solution to regional crises, particularly in\nthe Middle East. Since 1982, France has called for the\ncreation of a Palestinian State. Naturally, it would have\nto be viable, democratic and peaceful, and it should\ngive credible undertakings as regards Israel\u2019s security.\nGuarantees will be needed, yet the Palestinian State is\nnot the problem; it is the solution for reasons based on\nrights, humanity and security. Such is the EU\u2019s\ncommon stance today. This morning, before the\nAssembly, President Bush himself has made this his\nobjective. It is the path of reason \u2014 the only path that\ncan halt the murderous spiral of conflict between the\ntwo peoples.\nAdmittedly, responsibility for a lasting peace\nagreement lies first and foremost with the protagonists.\nUnless they make the move, no one else will be able to\novercome their fears and resentment and put an end to\nthe suffering of these two peoples. Yet, the increasing\nthreat that this conflict poses to international peace and\nsecurity requires that those who have the will and the\nmeans join forces in a push for peace, given that the\nmain players are evidently unable to do so unaided.\nThe urgency of the situation in the Near East\nobviously should not make us forget Iraq. Regional\nsecurity still needs to be secured by restoring an\ninternational monitoring capability and by alleviating\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people through the lifting of\nthe embargo on civilian goods. I hope the discussions\nnow in progress in the Security Council will finally\nbring this about.\nNor should we forget the Caucasus, where ancient\nquarrels live on and where new ones are rising to the\nfore. Yet, here again there is no other way than to seek\nnegotiated political solutions.\n27\n\nIn the Balkans, we realized that international\ninvolvement must be sustainable. Thanks to it, and\nthanks to new leaders, noteworthy progress has been\nachieved towards democracy, reconciliation and\nregional cooperation over the last two years. We must\nmake sure these positive changes are not challenged by\noutmoded patterns of behaviour. We must maintain and\npursue the Europeanization of the Balkans.\nTurning to the Great Lakes region, we know that\nthe lasting resolution of the conflict, which involves\nmore than eight countries, will be a negotiated solution\nthat will ensure the restoration of the sovereignty of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and include as well\nsafeguard clauses to protect the security of each of the\nStates. The Lusaka Agreement and the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions provide the framework for\nending this crisis, but they should be applied as quickly\nas possible. To halt the illegal use of the resources of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which often\noccurs in association with forced child labour, should\nbe an immediate priority.\nIn all the cases I have just referred to briefly \u2014\nand there are others \u2014 the problem we have to resolve\nis the coexistence of peoples who are at once close and\nantagonistic, deeply affected and divided by history\nand separated by fear and the spirit of revenge. We will\nachieve this only through perseverance and a clear\nunderstanding of each particular situation, guided by\nthe principles of the United Nations.\nEven if we managed to resolve all these regional\ncrises and others as well, our task would still not be\nover because, at the global level, the gulf between\nintentions for the world as stated at international\nmeetings and actual realities is becoming intolerable\nfor many peoples. We must redouble our efforts to\ncreate humane globalization. We saw this in Seattle, we\nsaw it in Genoa, and even more so in Durban. We can\nsee it in the reactions to the Afghan crisis and to many\nother issues. Despite the United Nations and our good\nresolutions, there is still no real universal consensus.\nWhat we call \u201cthe international community\u201d has yet to\nbe built. Is this a reason to throw in the towel? To the\ncontrary \u2013 absolutely not. France has long been\ndetermined to add its stone to this edifice. We have\nalready put forward numerous proposals to that end and\nwill continue to do so, with increased conviction.\nNeed I recall our well-known major objectives for\nthe world?\nFirst, we must achieve a fairer distribution of\nwealth; 3 billion people currently live on less than 2\ndollars per day, and the global income gap between the\nrichest and the poorest has doubled over the last 40\nyears.\nSecond, we must end impunity.\nThird, we must guarantee sustainable\ndevelopment everywhere \u2014 \u201csustainable\u201d, that little\nword that makes all the difference, or which should\nmake all the difference. The World Summit in\nJohannesburg in September 2002 will provide an\nopportunity to affirm a vision and a benchmark of\ndevelopment based on three intimately linked pillars:\neconomic, social and environmental.\nFourth, we must help refugees and fully respect\nthe right of asylum.\nFifth, we must manage population movements in\na humanitarian manner.\nSixth, we must draft international standards in a\ndemocratic way to ensure that they are entirely\nlegitimate and that everyone will consequently be\nbound to comply with them.\nSeventh, we must no longer tolerate situations of\nhuman distress. State sovereignty, which remains an\nessential feature of the international system, cannot, in\nextreme emergencies, be regarded as an absolute\nprinciple serving as a pretext for inaction. The Security\nCouncil must be able to fully assume its\nresponsibilities in cases of gross human rights\nviolations, for these also pose threats to international\npeace and security.\nEighth, we must aim at promoting balanced and\nnegotiated disarmament, which strengthens security\nand strategic stability.\nNinth, we must strive to allow all languages,\ncultures and civilizations to exist while maintaining a\ndialogue with one another.\nTenth, we must seek to improve the state of\nhealth worldwide, which for one thing means devoting\nmore resources to combating HIV/AIDS. I would hope\nthat the new Global AIDS and Health Fund will be\nmade operational by the beginning of 2002.\nBut we are undoubtedly now more aware than in\nrecent years that the attainment of these objectives,\nwhich are both indispensable, and very ambitious, calls\n28\n\ndifferent rules and different mechanisms, starting with\nthe reform and enlargement of the Security Council,\nwhich we have waited for all too long; with respect for\nthe role of the General Assembly; with the ratification\nof the major multilateral instruments \u2014 I am thinking\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court and\nthe Kyoto Protocol, among others; with a more\nappropriate and less indiscriminate use of sanctions\nwhen they are needed; with a clarification of the\nrespective and legitimate roles of Governments and\ncivil society; with an agreement on the modalities of\ninterference to deal with large-scale and extreme\nemergency situations; with a regulation and\ndevelopment round at the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), which is starting today in Doha; with closer\ncooperation and greater consistency between the WTO\nand the International Labour Organization; with the\ncreation of a world environmental organization; and\nwith reform of the international financial institutions. I\nshall stop this list here. I could go on, for there is so\nmuch that remains to be done.\nAll of us, as Members of the United Nations, are\nfaced with this challenge. But I do not hesitate to say\nhere that the rich countries \u2014 in other words, the West\nand a handful of other countries from the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, where\nsome 1.135 billion men and women live, have even\nmore responsibility than others. Now that the illusions\nof the last 10 years have been dispelled, the choice\nbefore us is harsh, but clear: either a world so unjust\nthat we have conflict with no foreseeable end, or, on\nthe contrary, an international community of the United\nNations, at last worthy of the name, to solve together\nhumanity\u2019s common problems and ensure its future.\nBut building this community, instead of just talking\nabout it or yearning for it, will mean for some of us\ngiving up privileges, sharing wealth and power in new\nways, and rewriting certain rules hitherto held to be\ninviolable. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist\nJoseph Stiglitz has written, free trade was designed by\nWestern countries for the Western countries. This is\ndebatable, of course, but none of this will happen\nwithout sacrifices, above all on the part of the rich and\npowerful countries.\nAt this very moment, a reshuffling of diplomatic\ncards on a grand scale is under way between the United\nStates, Russia, China, Europe, the Arab or Muslim\nworld, the other coalition partners, the rest of the world\nand the United Nations. I hope \u2014 I truly hope \u2014 that\nthis will help to bring about a vital awakening and that\nmy country, Europe and the United Nations will follow\nnew avenues, in deeds and not just words, and that all\nof us, together, will successfully extend the needed\ncoalition against terrorism to turn it into a coalition for\nan equitable world, and that this will lay the\ngroundwork for a renewal of the international system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I would like to express our condolences to the\nGovernments of the United States and the Dominican\n32\n\nRepublic, and to the families of the victims of this\nmorning\u2019s tragic plane crash.\nI express my warmest congratulations to Mr. Han\nSeung-soo on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish to assure him\nof my delegation\u2019s complete support in the exercise of\nhis difficult and lofty mission. I am convinced that,\nwith his experience and talents as a seasoned diplomat,\nhe will guide our discussions to success. To his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, I would like to express\nmy sincerest and warmest congratulations on the\ncompetence, dedication, effectiveness and authority\nthat he displayed throughout his term of office, which\nwas so rich in important events for the life of our\nOrganization.\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate\nMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to the post of\nSecretary-General of our Organization, and I would\nlike once again to express to him Mali\u2019s deepest\nappreciation for his steadfast efforts and his\ndetermination in the quest for a better world in the face\nof the many and complex challenges of the world of\ntoday. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the\nUnited Nations and to Mr. Annan reflects the work\naccomplished by the Secretary-General over the past\nfive years and is a source of legitimate pride to me as\nan African.\nOur fifty-sixth session is of particular importance,\nbeing held as it is in the aftermath of the brutal terrorist\nattacks that plunged the American nation into\nmourning on 11 September 2001. The Government of\nMali has firmly condemned these heinous acts and\nexpressed its solidarity with the American people and\nits support for the fight against terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations. Mali has already taken the\nmeasures necessary for the implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), inter alia, through the\nestablishment of an inter-ministerial committee in\ncharge of implementing and coordinating international\nmeasures. We have also undertaken to ratify various\nconventions against terrorism in order to complete the\nvital legal arsenal that we need to make a complete\ncontribution to the collective international efforts under\nthe auspices of the United Nations, and also to regional\nactions. In this respect, in addition to the Organization\nof the Islamic Conference Convention on Combating\nInternational Terrorism, we appeal for the entry into\nforce of the important Organization of African Unity\nConvention on the Prevention and Combating of\nTerrorism, adopted at Algiers in July 1999. We also\ncall for an effective partnership with Africa to\nstrengthen its capacity to combat terrorism.\nThe terrorist acts of 11 September, incompatible\nwith the lofty and tolerant message of Islam, have\nclearly shown the vulnerability of our current\ninternational system and have emphasized the need for\nincreased international cooperation in order to deal\nwith this situation. This is why the tragic events of 11\nSeptember 2001 call for the action now being taken\nagainst terrorism, but they also mean that we must in\nthe medium and long term reflect on the further ways\nof combating terrorism that we must devise. But above\nall, these events mean that we must endeavour\nvigorously to implement the Millennium Declaration\nprogramme of action in order to ensure prosperity for\nthe largest possible number of people.\nIn this context, Mali advocates integrated,\nsustained global action in which the United Nations\nshould play the primary role. While reiterating Africa\u2019s\nappeal for the holding of an international conference on\nterrorism, under the auspices of the United Nations,\nMali intends to support the initiatives of the Secretary-\nGeneral and of his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi, whom we congratulate on his appointment.\nDeeply concerned by the humanitarian situation in\nAfghanistan, we call for increased and coordinated\nemergency humanitarian assistance for the Afghan\npeople.\nThe maintenance of peace and security requires\nstrict control of weapons. Mali will actively and\nresolutely continue to support international and\nregional efforts in the field of disarmament and the\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction. The question of small\narms, as we see it, is another source of concern. In fact,\nsmall arms contribute to the breakdown of the social\nbalance, fuel conflicts and destabilize States, thus\njeopardizing all development efforts.\nMali, which hosted the African preparatory\nconference, will work towards the success of a follow-\nup to the conclusions of the United Nations Conference\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\nin All Its Aspects and towards the full implementation\nof the Programme of Action resulting from that\nimportant Conference. The West African experience in\nthis respect constitutes an important initiative to be\nsupported through the declaration of an Economic\n33\n\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\nmoratorium on the importation, exportation and\nmanufacture of small arms and light weapons and the\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for\nSecurity and Development in Africa.\nThe West African subregion remains\ncharacterized by the persistence of conflict, a high\nlevel of poverty, illicit trade in weapons and the\nproliferation of armed bands. In order to deal with\nthese conflicts, ECOWAS has given priority to a\nregional approach for the prevention and management\nof conflicts in order to deal with the root causes of\nconflict and its humanitarian consequences. The\nECOWAS protocol on the Mechanism for Conflict\nPrevention, Management, Resolution, Peacekeeping\nand Security, adopted in 1999, is a major tool for\nregional prevention and management of conflicts. Its\ninnovations include its Mediation and Security\nCouncil, its early warning system and the fact that it is\nrooted in the consolidation and protection of\ndemocracy and human rights.\nMali welcomes and encourages the positive\ndevelopments in the peace process in Sierra Leone that\nhave taken place since the second meeting of the\nCommittee of Six of the ECOWAS Mediation and\nSecurity Council with the United Nations, the\nGovernment of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary\nUnited Front (RUF) on 2 May 2001 in Abuja, Nigeria.\nProgress, although still fragile, has been made in\nthe Mano River Union region. As evidence of this we\ncan cite the ministerial meetings among the three\ncountries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ECOWAS\nintends to continue its efforts to help make the Mano\nRiver Union a pillar of stability and development. The\nrecent summit of heads of State and Government of\nECOWAS on a global and comprehensive approach to\nsecurity questions stresses once again the will of West\nAfrica to shoulder its responsibilities, helped by its\nvarious partners.\nThe implementation of these initiatives and West\nAfrican approaches to conflict prevention and\nmanagement will require assistance from the\ninternational community, in particular the United\nNations. In this respect, it is gratifying to note that a\ngenuine partnership has been established between the\nUnited Nations and ECOWAS. We firmly encourage\nthe establishment of the United Nations Office for West\nAfrica, as recommended by the inter-institutional\nmission that visited the region from 6 to 27 March\n2001.\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\nchildren will be an opportunity to build a progressive\nand universalist vision in order to promote a \u201cworld\nworthy of children\u201d, with the participation of all,\nwithin the framework of a world movement for\nchildren. ECOWAS, which has prepared for that\ngathering, is continuing its efforts to implement the\nAccra plan of action on the situation of children in\nconflict with the opening of a special office entrusted\nwith this question, the Optional Protocol that will soon\nbe adopted on the sale of children and the regional\ninitiative on joint vaccination days. In the near future, a\ndecade for the culture of children\u2019s rights will be\nexamined.\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court\nwill not only make it possible to bring to trial the\nperpetrators of the gravest crimes against the dignity of\nthe human person, but will also be an instrument of\ndeterrence, which can thus contribute to the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\nregard, I recall that Mali has already ratified the Rome\nStatute, thus expressing its support for the struggle\nagainst impunity and for the full respect of human\ndignity. We appeal to others to help make the court a\nreality as early as next year.\nIn the field of human security, we must provide\nan appropriate response \u2014 a global and urgent\nresponse \u2014 to the scourge of HIV/AIDS following the\nspecial session of June 2001, while at the same time\nincreasing our potential to fight malaria.\nOur responsibility is great indeed with regard to\nthe persistence of inequalities and the increase in\npoverty. The peoples of the world aspire to education,\nemployment, health and nutritional self-sufficiency \u2014\nin other words, they hope to attain more dignified and\nhumane living conditions. In this context, Africa,\nwhich intends to make its union a reality, wants to\nbecome master of its own destiny. It needs solidarity to\nhelp it strengthen its capacities and mobilize its own\ndevelopment resources. We will work hard toward the\nimplementation of the Programme of Action of the\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\nDeveloped Countries, held in Brussels in May 2001. As\nwas stated by President Konare, that Conference, by\nthe very fact that it was being convened, signalled\nprogress\n34\n\n\u201c... and it is also a test of the international\ncommunity following the Millennium\nDeclaration. There will be success only if we see\na will to move to concrete action, if we envisage\nstronger and bolder measures to finance\ndevelopment, to increase the effectiveness of\nforeign aid and to resolve the problems that are\nhampering the sustainable development of the\nleast developed countries.\u201d\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, which will be held in Monterrey in\nMarch 2002, should be an important event and an\ninterface for dialogue to find new means of\ncontributing to the financing of development and to\nreaffirm the political will for concrete development\nobjectives. This is why Mali believes that the\nConference will have to lead to the adoption of a\nconcise political declaration \u2014 a declaration with\nprecise strategic objectives reflecting the collective\nwill to act to resolve the problem of financing\ndevelopment and to lay the foundations for a real world\npartnership.\nAfrica is pleased that the high-level debate of the\n2001 substantive session of the Economic and Social\nCouncil (ECOSOC), which was held in Geneva in July,\nhad as its theme \u201cThe role of the United Nations\nsystem in supporting the efforts of African countries to\nachieve sustainable development\u201d, and awaits the\nrealization of the measures envisaged there. This role\nmust not be merely a declared one \u2014 it must lead to\nconcrete results. This is why we hope that the\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), which is now under way in Doha, Qatar, will\npromote new progress and decisive initiatives to make\nit possible for Africa to develop its assets.\nThe entry into force of the African Union, whose\nconstituent act was signed in Lom\u00e9 on 12 July 2000,\nreflects the commitment of African leaders to the\nintegration of our continent. In fact, the establishment\nof the African Union and the launching of the New\nPartnership for African Development, aimed at\neliminating poverty through sustainable development,\ncan help support the dynamics of regional integration.\nIn this respect, we appeal to the international\ncommunity to assist this African initiative, which is so\npromising for the future of the peoples of our\ncontinent.\nOur Organization is, more than ever before,\ncalled to act to promote international peace and\nsecurity and to achieve development for all. Here in the\nUnited Nations, we must act as full-fledged Member\nStates, shapers of our shared future. We say this in\norder to recall our shared responsibility to bring about\npeace in the Middle East, the Balkans and the Great\nLakes region \u2014 to mention just these cases \u2014 and to\ndo justice to human nature. We share responsibility to\nmanifest more solidarity and to provide assistance to\nresolve the many humanitarian crises that exist.\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains of\nconcern because of the persistence of violence in the\noccupied Palestinian territories. Mali firmly condemns\nthe violence that has been suffered by the Palestinian\npeople, and we believe that Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the principle of\nland for peace and the other relevant resolutions of the\nUnited Nations must serve as a basis for negotiations\nand the establishment of a just, global and lasting\npeace. We call for the resumption of these negotiations\nand reaffirm our unfailing attachment to the legitimate\nrights of the fraternal Palestinian people, including the\nright to the establishment of an independent State.\nMy delegation also expresses its hope that there\nwill be a definitive lifting of sanctions against the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nOn the Korean peninsula, the region from which\nyou come, my delegation hopes that the process of\nreconciliation now under way will experience further\nprogress, in accordance with General Assembly\nresolution 55/11, thanks to autonomous and\nstrengthened inter-Korean dialogue, and especially the\nholding of a second summit in the near future. In this\nspirit, my country will continue its action for the\nreconciliation and peaceful reunification of the two\nKoreas.\nAdapting the United Nations to the demands of\nour world is an urgent need. Mali remains convinced of\nthe vital necessity of democratizing the United Nations\nand restructuring its main organs, making them more\nrepresentative and credible. A democratization of the\nSecurity Council, whose structure no longer\ncorresponds to the realities of the world, will help\nreflect the shared will to make that organ more\neffective, representative and legitimate. Along these\nlines, we reiterate the demands of Africa for an\nequitable allocation of the two categories of seats, in\n35\n\naccordance with the Harare Declaration and the\ndecisions adopted by the heads of State and\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity.\nIn conclusion, the peoples of the United Nations\nare watching us as we carry out the promises contained\nin the Millennium Declaration. We must build a new\nworld \u2014 a world that reflects our intelligence, a world\nof justice, a world that embodies the essential values of\nall humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to\nextend to you, Mr. President, my felicitations on your\nelection. I also wish to congratulate your predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his stewardship of the\nmillennium session of the General Assembly. Deep\nappreciation is also due to the Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring efforts to translate the\nvision of the Millennium Declaration into policies and\nactions by the world community.\nMr. Secretary-General, please also accept my\nheartiest congratulations on the award of the centenary\nNobel Peace Prize conferred upon you and your\nOrganization, and on your election for a second term to\nyour prestigious office.\nLast year, at the Millennium Summit, all of us\nwere looking forward to a renaissance in the new\nmillennium \u2014 a renaissance in the hearts and minds of\npeople, for a better world where peace and justice\nwould prevail. Unfortunately, today we gather against\nthe sombre backdrop of the terrorist outrage that the\nworld witnessed in shock and horror on that fateful day\nof 11 September. In seconds, images of fire and death\nreached all of us around the globe. Thousands of\ninnocent lives were lost in minutes. Eighty or more\nnations lost some of their brightest and their best.\nPakistan, like the rest of the world, mourned the\ncolossal loss of innocent lives. The map of the world\nchanged, and the entire globe descended into a deep\ncrisis. At a time of such great turmoil, when there is a\nneed for clear thought and firm action, I come from\nPakistan with a message of determination and resolve\nas well as a message of peace for all peoples.\nThe General Assembly meets this year under the\nshadow of a horrendous act of terror perpetrated\nagainst the people of the United States \u2014 an act for\nwhich no grievance or cause can ever be a justification,\nan act that must be condemned unambiguously and in\nthe strongest words. This was an attack on humanity\nitself and we all must therefore unite to fight this\nscourge. Pakistan has followed words with actions.\nNow that the world has committed itself to fight\nagainst terrorism, it is time for introspection. In this\ndark hour, we owe it to posterity to shed light on some\ndangerous and growing trends, misconceptions and\n2\n\nmisperceptions which, if not countered, may lead the\nworld into even greater disorder and disharmony.\nMuslims in various parts of the world, and the\nreligion of Islam itself, are being held responsible for\nthe trials the world is facing. This point of view is\ntotally misplaced. Just as all religions teach peace and\nlove for fellow beings, so Islam places upon its\nadherents the obligation to do good, to be generous,\nmerciful, kind and just to all fellow beings. The\nMuslim greeting \u201cAssalam alaikum\u201d, meaning \u201cPeace\nbe with you\u201d, symbolizes the very essence of the\nIslamic faith. Islam is a religion of peace, compassion\nand tolerance.\nTerrorism is not a Christian, Buddhist, Jewish or\nMuslim belief. It is to be condemned no matter who the\nperpetrator, be it an individual, a group or a state.\nWe need to ask ourselves what really causes these\nextreme acts around the world. To my mind, it is\nunresolved political disputes: disputes in Bosnia,\nKosovo, Palestine, Kashmir and other places.\nUnfortunately, all these disputes involve Muslims and,\nwhat is more sad, Muslims happen to be the victims in\nall of them. This fact tends to give a religious tinge to\nthese otherwise political disputes. The lack of progress\nin resolving them has created in Muslims a sense of\ndeprivation, hopelessness and powerlessness.\nThe frustration grows even worse when disputes\nlike those relating to Kashmir and Palestine, which\nhave been the subject of Security Council resolutions,\nremain unsettled. The question then becomes, are the\npeople asking for their rights in accordance with\nUnited Nations resolutions to be called terrorists, or are\nthe countries refusing to implement United Nations\nresolutions perpetrators of State terrorism? In Kashmir,\nIndian occupation forces have killed over 75,000\nKashmiris, attributing these killings to foreign\nterrorists. It is time that India stopped such deceit.\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions on\nKashmir must be implemented.\nMedia images of the Palestinian child,\nMohammed Al-Durra, were etched into the hearts and\nminds of people all over the world. It is perverse to\nregard the rape of Kashmiri women as a punishment\ninflicted in the course of war. The images of those\nmoments when the World Trade Centre towers came\ndown will remain definitive for all the agony, disbelief\nand loss that people suffer from acts of terror all over\nthe world. All forms of terror must be condemned,\nprevented and fought against, but in condemning them\nthe world must not trample upon the genuine rights,\naspirations and urges of the people who are fighting for\ntheir liberation and are subjected to State terrorism.\nTo fight the extremist, deprive him of his\nmotivation. The extremist survives in an environment\nwhere millions suffer injustice and indignity. Deprive\nhim of his support by giving all the peoples of the\nworld peace, security, justice and dignity, regardless of\nfaith, religion or creed.\nA just and honourable solution for the people of\nKashmir and an end to the miseries of the people of\nPalestine are the major burning issues that have to be\naddressed vigorously, boldly, imaginatively and\nurgently. We must get to the root causes; cosmetic\nsolutions will only make matters worse. Consider the\nanalogy of a tree: terrorists are like so many leaves \u2014\ntake out some, and there will be plenty more, an\nunending growth. Terrorist networks are branches:\nprune a few, and there will be others, and further\ngrowth. The only way to do deal with them is to go for\nthe roots. Eliminate the roots, and there will be no tree.\nThe roots are the causes, which need to be addressed,\ntackled and eliminated, fairly, justly and honourably, so\nas to give people back their dignity, self-respect and\nhonour.\nIn essence, therefore, to tackle the issue of\nterrorism in its entirety, we need to follow a\nthree-pronged strategy of going for individual\nterrorists; moving against terrorist organizations; and\naddressing disputes throughout the world in a just\nmanner.\nAfter the events of 11 September, Pakistan took a\ndeliberate, principled decision to join the world\ncoalition in its fight against terrorism. This decision\nhas catapulted us, once again, into the position of being\na front-line State in the battle against terrorism. While\nthe people of Pakistan have accepted this new reality,\nthey still suffer from a sense of betrayal and\nabandonment as a result of being left in the lurch in\n1989 after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nThen, too, we were a front-line State \u2014 and what we\ngot in return was 3 million refugees, a shattered\neconomy, drugs and a Kalashnikov culture, to be dealt\nwith single-handedly and through our own limited\nresources. Pakistan only hopes that the mistakes of the\npast will not be repeated and that Pakistan\u2019s legitimate\nconcerns will be addressed. Our economy again faces a\n3\n\ncrisis from the fallout from the operations in\nAfghanistan. We need financial and commercial\nsupport on an urgent basis, and hope that this will be\nforthcoming.\nAfter the events of 11 September, and after\nOsama bin Laden and Al Qaeda became an\ninternational issue, Pakistan tried its utmost, up to the\nlast moment, to work with the Afghan Government so\nas to avert military action in Afghanistan. Regrettably,\nwe did not meet with success, and the coalition\noperation against terrorists in Afghanistan continues,\nwith no immediate end in sight. Sadly, the civilian\ncasualties resulting from this action are increasingly\ndepicted as an open war against the already poor,\nsuffering and innocent people of Afghanistan. The\nworld in general, and Pakistan in particular, mourn the\nloss of these innocent lives, and sympathize with the\nbereaved. It is desirable that the military operation be\nas short and as accurately targeted as possible. It is also\nessential that a fall-back political strategy be evolved\nwhich could attain the same objectives as those being\nsought through military application.\nIn its entirety, dealing with Afghanistan involves\na three-pronged strategy to address military, political\nand humanitarian-cum-rehabilitation issues. It must\nremain the effort of the coalition, after achieving its\nmilitary objectives, to prevent a vacuum leading to\nanarchy, through the immediate application of joint\npolitical and rehabilitation strategies.\nIn our view, the political set-up in Afghanistan\nmust be home-grown and not imposed \u2014 and I say that\nhaving knowledge of the Afghan psyche. We must\nensure the unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan,\nwithin a broad-based, multi-ethnic dispensation,\nrepresentative of the demographic composition of the\ncountry.\nThe people of Afghanistan have been suffering\nthe ravages and devastation of conflict for over two\ndecades. It is the moral obligation of the world\ncommunity to support them generously. Assistance to\nAfghanistan should be in two forms: first, ongoing\nhumanitarian assistance; and secondly, post-military\noperations, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\nTo offset the ill-effects of the ongoing military\noperation, it is imperative that we launch a more\ncoordinated and concerted humanitarian relief effort\ninside and outside Afghanistan, with more generous\nfunding. This will go a long way to alleviating the\nsufferings of the common Afghan.\nIt is equally important that we, concurrently,\nformulate a post-operation rehabilitation programme\nfor when peace returns to Afghanistan. This effort\nwould entail, at the minimum, the restoration of water-\nmanagement systems; the revival of agriculture through\nland development; the reconstruction of the physical\ninfrastructure \u2014 roads, buildings and utilities; and the\nestablishment of institutions.\nA stable and peaceful Afghanistan is in the vital\ninterests of the region and, in particular, of Pakistan.\nConditions must be created for the more than 3 million\nrefugees in Pakistan to return to their country. We\npropose the establishment of an \u201cAfghan trust fund\u201d,\nunder United Nations auspices, for the rehabilitation\nand reconstruction effort.\nI would now like to focus on the harsh realities in\nthe developing countries, which have a relationship\nwith extremism of all kinds. Poverty and deprivation\nlead to frustration, making the masses vulnerable to\nexploitation by extremist organizations. It is the\ncollective moral responsibility of the developed world\nto address this issue squarely, through substantive\neconomic uplift, poverty alleviation and social action\nprogrammes in the developing countries. Economic\nimbalances have to be removed in order to achieve a\njust, equitable and harmonious world order. A major\nstep in this direction would be to reduce, if not\neliminate, the debt burden, which hangs like a\nmillstone around the necks of the poor and the\nunderdeveloped.\nThe bigger tragedy of the third world is that their\nrulers, together with their minions, plunder their\ncountries\u2019 wealth and are afforded easy access to safe\nhavens to stash away the loot in the first world.\nRestrictions have long been imposed on the laundering\nof drug money, and the money supply for terrorists is\nbeing choked off. Why can similar restrictions not be\nimposed on the money-laundering of loot?\nI appeal, through this forum, to all of the\ndeveloped countries to legislate against deposits of ill-\ngotten money, to assist in investigating the looters and\nto ensure the early return of the plundered wealth to its\ncountries of origin. In fact, I would not be far off the\nmark if I were to state that, with the return of this\nlooted money, many of the developing countries might\n4\n\nbe able to pay back their debts and revive their\neconomies.\nPakistan is deeply conscious of the nuclear\ndimension of the security environment of our region,\nthe danger it poses and the responsibility it places on\nnuclear-weapon States, particularly the two nuclear\nStates in South Asia. We are ready to discuss how\nPakistan and India can create a stable South Asian\nsecurity mechanism through the peaceful resolution of\ndisputes, the preservation of the nuclear and\nconventional balance, confidence-building measures\nand the non-use of force, as prescribed by the United\nNations Charter. In this context, we are ready to\ndiscuss nuclear and missile restraints, as well as\nnuclear risk-reduction measures, with India, in a\nstructured, comprehensive and integrated dialogue.\nPakistan is fully aware of the responsibilities of\nits nuclear status. We have declared a unilateral\nmoratorium on nuclear testing. Pakistan was not the\nfirst to initiate nuclear tests and will not be the first to\nresume them. We are ready to formalize a bilateral\ntreaty with India for a mutual test ban. We have\nstrengthened our export controls and have established\nmulti-layered custodial controls on all our nuclear\nassets. Let me assure the Assembly that our strategic\nassets are very well guarded and in very safe hands. We\nare constantly upgrading our command and control\nmeasures, and we have instituted an elaborate nuclear\ncommand and control mechanism for ironclad custodial\ncontrols to ensure the safety and security of all our\nassets. Pakistan is opposed to an arms race in South\nAsia, be it nuclear or conventional. We will maintain\ndeterrence at the minimum level. We want to live in the\nregion with honour and with dignity.\nI would now like to very briefly cover internal\ndevelopments in Pakistan. Over the past two years, the\nfocus has been on economic revival, poverty\nalleviation, the improvement of governance in\nPakistan, political restructuring and the introduction of\ngenuine democracy in the country. We have\nsuccessfully put in place a sound democratic structure\nthat is based on empowerment of the people at the\ngrassroots level. A revolutionary step has been taken\nthrough the provision of one third of the seats to\nwomen on the district-level governing councils.\nI want to put on record at this gathering that\nPakistan is proud of this representation and\nempowerment of women, which is a unique feature in\nthe world. Our resolve to hold elections to the\nProvincial and National Assemblies and to the Senate\nin October 2002, in accordance with the road map I\nannounced last August, will remain unchanged in spite\nof the prevailing environment in the region.\nIn conclusion, and in view of the fact that we are\ngoing through a time of enormous trials and\ntribulations, I wish to make an appeal \u2014 an appeal for\nthe sake of mankind, for the sake of our future\ngenerations and for the sake of a better world.\nLet justice prevail; let no people be wronged; let\nsuffering be eliminated; let discontent be addressed; let\nhumanity rise as one nation to eliminate subjugation of\nthe weak; and let there be peace.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nfact that we are meeting under the presidency of one of\nthe most eminent personalities of the Republic of\nKorea bears eloquent testimony to the positive changes\nin international relations and to the end of the\nideological bipolarization of the world.\nI would like at the outset to convey the\ncondolences of the Republic of the Niger to the United\nStates of America and the Dominican Republic for the\ntragedy that occurred this morning.\nThe Niger would like to warmly congratulate\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, as well as\nthe other members of the Bureau. We are sure that he\nwill demonstrate the same dynamism, energy and\nhuman qualities as his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri\nof Finland, as he continues his outstanding work for the\nbenefit of humankind.\nI would like to reaffirm the warm congratulations\nof the Niger to our brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, the\nSecretary-General, for his re-election to a post whose\nvisibility, prestige and effectiveness he has done so\nmuch to enhance, as well as for the award of the 2001\nNobel Peace Prize, which is a testimony \u2014 if further\nevidence were needed \u2014 to the global recognition of\nthe work that he has already accomplished in the\nservice of humanity.\nThis serves as an eloquent rebuttal to the\narguments of all those who claim to find, in the denial\nof the fundamental principles of dialogue between\ncultures and nations \u2014 principles enshrined in the\nCharter \u2014 the high road to salvation. In this regard, the\nNiger endorses the relevant General Assembly and\nSecurity Council resolutions, and welcomes the\nemergence of a general consensus on the need to wage\nwar against terrorism on a collective and global basis,\nwithin the framework of the international legality\nembodied by the United Nations.\nIf we are to succeed, the fight against terrorism\nmust be based on a programme of international\ncooperation, including, in particular, substantial\nfinancial and technical assistance to the most\ndisadvantaged States so as to enable them to make a\nsignificant contribution to that process.\nStill on the subject of peace and security, I would\nlike to point out that, within the realm of disarmament\nand the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are in\nthe final stages of the process of ratifying the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and of\nsigning a safeguards agreement with the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nWith regard to conventional weapons, the\nconvening of the United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects fulfilled one of the commitments\nundertaken by our heads of State or Government in the\nhistoric Millennium Declaration. The Niger welcomes\nthe fact that the Conference was able to adopt, by\nconsensus, a Programme of Action to combat that\nscourge, which is one of the most serious threats to\ninternational peace and security. Furthermore, the\nNiger welcomes the fact that that Programme of Action\ntook account of the principal concerns expressed by\nAfrican States in the Bamako Declaration, by\nproviding, in particular, financial and technical\nassistance measures for the disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.\nNo part of the world has been spared the illicit\ntrafficking in and circulation of small arms. But the\ndeveloping countries, in particular those on the\ncontinent of Africa, are paying the highest price for the\nproliferation of small arms from the standpoint of their\nsecurity, stability and development.\nThat is why the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States moratorium on the manufacture, import\nand export of small arms, adopted in Abuja in October\n1998, which was extended for three years on 5 July, as\nwell as the Programme for Coordination and\nAssistance for Security and Development, should\nreceive substantial financial support from the\ninternational community.\n36\n\nIn this context, the Niger reaffirms its support for\nthe proposal of the United Kingdom to create an\ninternational fund, to be managed by the United\nNations Development Programme, for the collection of\nsmall arms. If it is effective, that fund will help to\nsupport regional and national projects for the collection\nand destruction of small arms in exchange for\ndevelopment projects. In this regard, I am pleased to\nreaffirm to the Assembly the gratitude of the Niger to\nthe countries that participated in the work of the Group\nof Interested States on Practical Disarmament\nMeasures.\nSince the events of 11 September, the entire\nworld has been assessing the tragic consequences of\nthat Manichaean ideology. Terrorists are, without\ndoubt, a threat to international peace and security. It\nhas been claimed that those events were committed in\nthe name of Islam. But as everyone knows, Islam is the\nreligion of the golden mean, and condemns suicide and\nmurder. It advocates dialogue and persuasion and the\nsteadfast combating of any tendency towards individual\nor collective nihilism. That is one of the reasons why\nthe Niger fully associates itself with the global\ncoalition against terrorism. That is also why, during the\nrecent discussions on measures to eliminate\ninternational terrorism, the Niger reiterated its firm\ncondemnation of all forms of violence and its\ndetermination to commit itself to all subregional and\ninternational initiatives aimed at eradicating that\nscourge.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\nundertook to enhance the effectiveness of the United\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity by providing it with the necessary tools and\nresources to better prevent conflict, bring about the\npeaceful settlement of disputes and consolidate peace\nand post-conflict reconstruction. In order to be\neffective, a preventive conflict-management strategy,\nas set out in the report of the Secretary-General,\nrequires the international community, working together\nwith national and regional actors, to adopt a\ncomprehensive approach encompassing political,\ndiplomatic, humanitarian and institutional measures,\nand to undertake actions aimed at economic\nrevitalization. As a follow-up to that report, last July in\nAgadez my country, acting within the national dynamic\naimed at consolidating peace and with the support of\nthe United Nations, organized a forum on conflict\nprevention \u2014 the first of its kind in Africa. That forum\nrecommended the elaboration of a national conflict-\nprevention strategy, the implementation of which\nwould be coordinated by the National Commission for\nSocial Dialogue, which brings together representatives\nof the State and civil society.\nFor too long, the international community\u2019s\nattention has been focused on the Middle East, where\nrepeated efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of\nthe Israeli-Arab conflict have ended in deadlock. The\nsupport of the G-8 for the idea of sending international\nobservers to Palestinian territory is an important step\nforward; such action would guarantee the impartial\napplication of the recommendations of the Mitchell\nreport.\nThe Niger would like to reaffirm, here in the\nAssembly, that a lasting settlement of the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict cannot be achieved without the\nrealization by the Palestinian people of their\ninalienable right to an independent sovereign State.\nThe Niger wholeheartedly supports the position of the\nUnited States of America in this regard.\nWith regard to the conflict in Western Sahara, the\nNiger supports the efforts of the United Nations, in\nparticular those of the Secretary-General and his\nPersonal Envoy, to bring about a final settlement that is\nacceptable to interested and concerned parties.\nWith regard to Asia, the summit meeting that\ntook place last July in India between the President of\nPakistan and the Prime Minister of India raised great\nhopes for a political settlement of the conflict in\nKashmir. Such initiatives must be supported and\nencouraged so as to allow for the self-determination of\nthe Kashmiri people as soon as possible in accordance\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nBy according highest priority to the specific\nneeds of Africa, the Millennium Summit recognized\nthe full magnitude of the serious problems that beset\nour continent. Proof of this is that most African States\nare included on the list of least advanced and poorest\ncountries and have been left behind by the\ntechnological revolution. The ravages caused by armed\nconflicts and the HIV/AIDS pandemic have affected\nmore than 26 million Africans and wiped out the hard-\nwon progress made over the past decade. At the same\ntime, the flow of official development assistance to\nAfrica has plummeted, while foreign direct investments\nhave continued to stagnate. Worse yet, between 1999\nand 2000 those investments even fell from $10.5\n37\n\nbillion to $9.1 billion, while during the same period\nthey rose in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.\nIt is therefore urgent to increase the volume of\nofficial development assistance, to expand debt-\ncancellation initiatives, to improve the access of\nAfrican exports to international markets and to promote\ninvestment. These measures must be accompanied by\nappropriate support for the efforts of the United\nNations system because this Organization is the best\nforum for promoting new partnerships for the benefit\nof Africa.\nIn this respect, the Niger very much hopes that\nAfrica\u2019s drive to reappropriate its own development\nwill be encouraged. That drive is marked by the\nproliferation of national and regional initiatives, the\nmost recent manifestation of which was the adoption at\nthe Lusaka summit of the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) of an African development plan, the\nimplementation of which the G-8 has decided to\nsupport.\nThe forthcoming International Conference on\nFinancing for Development should prove to be a\ndecisive turning point in the establishment of a more\njust and equitable world economic order. It should,\ninter alia, lead to the adoption of a clear political\ndeclaration defining strategic priorities, accompanied\nby a precise timetable, with respect to the\nstrengthening of the capacities of the developing\ncountries, particularly the least developed among them,\nand their integration into the world economy. The\nConference should be the point of departure of a broad\nworld partnership to channel all energies towards the\nmobilization of resources for development and the\nreform of international financial structures.\nIn this regard, the 10-year Brussels Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries has made it\npossible to lay the foundations of an enhanced world\npartnership to achieve the economic growth essential to\nreducing poverty. Following the firm commitments\nundertaken in Brussels, there are now grounds for hope\nthat, particularly with regard to trade, the current round\nof World Trade Organization negotiations in Qatar will\ntake fully into account the interests of the least\ndeveloped countries, whose 630 million inhabitants\nhave a legitimate aspiration to benefit from the positive\neffects of globalization.\nIn the absence of an appropriate response from\nthe affluent countries, the damage caused by the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic may prove to be irreparable, given\nthat some specialists estimate that there will be 100\nmillion dead from that disease by the year 2010 if\neffective measures are not taken immediately to stem\nthe scourge.\nNeed we recall, moreover, that malaria claims as\nmany human victims in Africa as AIDS, particularly in\nWest Africa? It is comforting to note, however, that the\ninternational community has finally become aware of\nthe signal danger posed by that disease. The Niger\nwelcomes the decision of the United Nations to\nproclaim the period 2001-2010 the Decade to Roll\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in\nAfrica. The United Nations is thus in step with the\nvarious initiatives of the OAU in the struggle against\nmalaria, led by Yahya Jammeh of Gambia, Olusegun\nObasanjo of Nigeria and Mamadou Tandja of the Niger.\nThere can be no doubt that the struggle against\nmajor diseases calls for substantial resources and a\nstrong capacity for coordinated action. The Niger\ntherefore welcomes the Secretary-General\u2019s\nestablishment of the Global AIDS and Health Fund,\nwhich should give a new dynamic to the struggle\nagainst AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which together\nclaim 5 million dead throughout the world every year.\nThe announcement made at the G-8 summit in\nGenoa that $1.8 billion will be devoted to launching\nthe Global Fund is an important step in the right\ndirection. In spite of everything, a great deal remains to\nbe done. According to United Nations estimates,\napproximately $3 billion must be mobilized before\n2001 for AIDS alone and contributions of $7 billion to\n$10 billion will be necessary every year thereafter until\n2005. Thus, today more than ever, the international\ncommunity must demonstrate active solidarity between\nrich and poor and a sense of unshakeable collective\nresponsibility \u2014 in a word, unfailing political will \u2014\nif it wishes to translate into deeds the Declaration of\nCommitment adopted at the special session on\nHIV/AIDS.\nThe progress achieved in the Niger in its current\nreform programme has allowed us to re-establish and\nconsolidate the country\u2019s economic bases, to revive\nfruitful relations with the international financial\ninstitutions and thus to secure the Niger\u2019s eligibility for\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\nFurthermore, the Niger recently established a new\nframework for the implementation of its own national\n38\n\nanti-poverty policy. A strategy for reducing poverty\ndefines the country\u2019s priorities and measures and\nactions to be undertaken in order to achieve the targets\nset in various spheres, which will allow us to make\nserious inroads into poverty by 2015.\nThis struggle against poverty in the Niger enjoys\nthe highest political involvement. A programme\ninitiated personally by the President of the Republic,\nMr. Mamadou Tandja, is designed to improve the living\nstandards of the people of our country. The first phase\nof what is known as \u201cThe Programme of the President\nof the Republic\u201d has already led to the construction of\n1,000 wells, 100 mini-dams, 100 schools and 100\nhealth centres for rural communities. It is well known\nthat such communities in the Niger suffer intractable\nilliteracy, a serious lack of infrastructure and cyclical\nfood shortages caused by irregular rainfall. The\nProgramme also stresses the link between poverty and\nthe environment. It is in that context that we plan to\nplant 1 million trees throughout our national territory\nby the end of this year.\nThe Government is thus perfectly in step with the\ndeep-rooted aspirations of the people of the Niger, who\nrecognize in its actions their ancestral lore of personal\nand collective effort against adversity, and with its\nbilateral and multilateral partners, whose ongoing\nconcern is the restoration of the environment. All the\ninstitutions of the United Nations family and the\nEuropean Union \u2014 in particular France, Germany,\nItaly and Great Britain \u2014 as well as Canada and Japan,\nhave contributed significantly to reviving the\necological system and to combating desertification in\nthe Niger.\nIn the Niger, we are fully aware that this fight is\nprimary a national one. We wage it through\nvolunteerism, the roots of which are deeply entrenched\nin our traditions and extend beyond our frontiers. I take\nthis opportunity to reiterate the profound gratitude of\nthe Niger to all the bodies of the United Nations\nsystem, in particular the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund and our other\ndevelopment partners, for their precious support for the\nefforts of the Government to promote the well-being of\nour people.\nTo conclude, I would say that the international\ncommunity needs a strong United Nations to achieve\nthe ambitious objectives set forth in the Charter and to\nimplement the Millennium Declaration. It is therefore\nnecessary to give unstinting support to the Secretary-\nGeneral in his efforts to reform the Organization,\nstrengthen its role and secure the resources that will\nallow him to accomplish his task effectively. The\nUnited Nations remains indeed the only institution\ncapable of bringing about the new world order to which\nwe all so deeply aspire.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it gives\nme great pleasure to address this Assembly under your\nable and distinguished leadership. May I, on behalf of\nmy delegation, take this opportunity to extend to you\nour warmest congratulations on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. You may rest assured, Sir, of the fullest\nsupport and co-operation of my delegation in the\ndaunting tasks that you will be called upon to confront\nduring your tenure.\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to thank\nMr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent manner in which he\nsteered the work of the last session of the General\nAssembly.\nMay I also congratulate a distinguished son of\nAfrica, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\nunopposed election to a second term. The award of the\nNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations\nconfirms the high esteem in which he and our\nOrganization are held.\nAs we gather in New York, the atrocities of 11\nSeptember remain fresh in our collective memory.\nAllow me to pay a special tribute to the memory of the\nthousands of innocent victims of the terrorist attacks on\nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in\nPennsylvania.\nWe condemn the attempts of the terrorists to\njustify their acts as being in conformity with the tenets\nof Islam. We do so because neither Islam nor any other\nreligion condones the killing of innocent civilians.\nIn order to preserve the lives of our citizens and\ntheir way of life, we are bound to focus on the sequels\nof those heinous terrorist attacks.\nInternational terrorism must be fought with all the\nmeans at our disposal. Terrorists know only one thing,\nand that is destruction. While Mauritius is fully\ncommitted to the global coalition against terrorism, we\nurge the international community to take a long-term\nview of international terrorism. Terrorism is the\ngreatest threat to international peace, security and\ndevelopment.\nWe also believe that the war on terrorism must be\nfought on the basis of principles and standards which\nare accepted by every single State. Terrorism remains\nterrorism, and there can be no justification for it at any\ntime or under any circumstances. We also consider that\ncross-border terrorism has caused and is continuing to\ncause immeasurable damage in many parts of the\nIndian subcontinent and in Africa. We are convinced\nthat there must be no double or multiple standards in\nthe war against terrorism. In this context, we believe\nthat the International Criminal Court must become\n14\n\noperational at the earliest date, and countries which\nrejected it in the past must review their stand.\nWe shall work closely with the Security Council\nand the international community at large in order to\nfully implement Security Council resolutions 1368\n(2001) and 1373 (2001).\nTogether with the war on terrorism, we need to\nwage many other wars, particularly in the light of the\nMillennium Declaration adopted last year. We need to\npursue wars against poverty, ignorance, hunger and\nunderdevelopment. The war against the scourge of\nHIV/AIDS is a war that we cannot afford to lose. It is\nour belief that the international community must\nremain focused on these issues, as they are very often\nthe breeding ground for dissent, crises, wars and\nterrorism.\nPeace and security will be in danger as long as\nnuclear arsenals and weapons of mass destruction\ncontinue to exist and proliferate. Now that terrorists\nmay get hold of or may already have in their\npossession such weapons, it becomes extremely urgent\nfor the nuclear States to start meaningful discussions\non the elimination of these weapons within a specified\ntime frame.\nWith the conclusion of the recent United Nations\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, we need to move\ntowards early implementation of the measures\ncontained in its Programme of Action. For Africa, this\nis a top priority. We are convinced that disarmament\ncannot remain a slogan; it must be effectively\naddressed.\nConflicts, wars and crises still persist in many\nparts of the African continent and elsewhere,\nparticularly in the Balkans. Although we are\nencouraged by the latest developments in Burundi and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and by the\ndirect talks between Rwanda and Uganda to defuse\nsituations before they become explosive, we consider\nthat peace and security in Africa deserve the closer\ninvolvement of the international community,\nparticularly in making available adequate financial\nresources. We expect early and full deployment of the\nthird phase of the United Nations Organization Mission\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in\nkeeping with the Security Council resolutions, and we\nsupport the inter-Congolese dialogue.\nWe are grateful to African leaders like former\nPresident Nelson Mandela, President Moi and former\nPresident Masire for their commitment to ridding\nAfrica of conflicts and to paving the way for an\nAfrican economic take-off.\nMauritius is committed to a major reform of the\ncomposition of the Security Council. We are convinced\nthat we should amend the Charter in a way that would\nreflect the emergence of new power structures\njustifying an expansion of the membership. Whatever\nmay be the criteria for an expanded membership, we\nbelieve that India ought to become a permanent\nmember at the earliest opportunity. The expansion of\nthe Security Council, as well as a reassessment of the\nabsolutist veto, cannot be delayed any longer.\nThe birth of the African Union coincides with its\nrole as the engine to drive forward the process of the\nNew Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).\nThe New Partnership for African Development is a\nroad map for Africa to eradicate poverty and to achieve\nthe sustainable growth and development of the\ncontinent, thereby allowing it to find its place in the\nworld economy. It is a call for a new relationship\nbetween Africa and its partners.\nWe are mindful of the setback which the events of\n11 September have caused to the major economies, but\nwe are also hopeful that the G-8 will remain committed\nto providing to Africa all assistance for the effective\nimplementation of NEPAD.\nMauritius supports the liberalization of\ninternational trade under the rules of the World Trade\nOrganization. We are, however, disappointed at the\nlack of progress with regard to implementation issues\nand the undertakings of the major trading countries\nunder previous Uruguay Round agreements. The terms\nof trade as well as non-trade concerns are tilted too\nmuch in favour of the developed countries, which are\nstill denying market access. Africa, which today\naccounts for less than two per cent of global trade,\ncould, with the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers\nin the developed countries, significantly increase its\nshare of global trade and thus improve the standard of\nliving of its people. An increase in trade for Africa will\nalso mean a lesser dependence on aid.\nWhile globalization throws up opportunities as\nwell as challenges, we also have to be conscious of its\nnegative aspects. We appeal for there to be no double\ndealing in trade with poor countries.\n15\n\nThe Small Island Developing States experience a\nvariety of inherent disadvantages. In their efforts to\nachieve sustainable development and the need to\nenhance their capabilities to function effectively within\nthe new globalized trading arrangements, my\ndelegation calls for the urgent and effective\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates.\nWe welcome the statement by the United States\nthat it supports the creation of a Palestinian State. We\nconsider this to be a major step in the right direction\nfor the resolution of the Middle East crisis. We urge the\nUnited States to be even-handed in its relations with\nboth Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We also\nbelieve that the unilateral imposition of conditions\nprior to the resumption of peace talks is unhelpful.\nWith the support of the international community, we\nare confident that Israel and Palestine can, within the\nframework of the Mitchell report and the Tenet plan,\nwork out a just and durable peace in which the States\nof Israel and Palestine can live side by side, secure\nwithin their respective boundaries.\nIn our region, the Southern African Development\nCommunity  and the Common Market for Eastern and\nSouthern Africa (COMESA) are emerging as important\ninstitutions integrating our economies. These initiatives\nare helping the member States to better confront the\nchallenges of globalization. COMESA is the first\nregional institution to have set up a free trade area.\nThese regional institutions also address issues of good\ngovernance, as well as security and peace. We take an\ninterest in the domestic situation of our fellow\nmembers inasmuch as whatever happens in one\nmember State inevitably impacts, negatively or\notherwise, on all member States.\nWe urge all parties to the Framework Agreement\nfor National Reconciliation to take all measures to\nexpedite the process towards the referendum in the\nComoros that will usher in a new constitution. Under\nthe aegis of the African Union, Mauritius is proposing\nto host a donors\u2019 meeting as soon as the Framework\nAgreement is implemented.\nWe continue to claim our sovereignty over the\nChagos archipelago, which was excised by the United\nKingdom from the then colony of Mauritius in\nviolation of international law and of General Assembly\nresolution 1514 (XV). We are convinced that the time\nfor the United Kingdom to engage in talks for the early\nretrocession of the archipelago to Mauritian\nsovereignty is long overdue, inasmuch as problems left\nover from colonial days cannot remain unresolved.\nWe are also concerned by the plight of all those\nMauritians, commonly known as the Ilois, who were\nforcibly and in outright violation of their fundamental\nrights removed from the islands forming the\narchipelago by the then colonial Power. We support\ntheir legitimate claim for all appropriate remedies.\nWith regard to Tromelin, I reiterate the position\nof my delegation, as expressed in the General\nAssembly last year, and once again call on the French\nGovernment to enter into constructive negotiations for\nthe settlement of this issue.\nAs I speak here, bombs are still falling over\nAfghanistan. We are aware that the living conditions of\nthe civilian population are difficult. We deplore the\nloss of civilian lives. We are confident, however, that\nthe international community will rise to the occasion in\nproviding all humanitarian assistance to the needy in\nAfghanistan. We are hopeful that the efforts under way\nto install a broad-based Government in Afghanistan\nwill be successful.\nThe Conference of Parties to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in\nMorocco, the World Food Summit in Rome, the\ndiscussions on trade issues in Doha and a host of other\nmeetings in recent days demonstrate the close\ndependence that we have on each other. No country can\nafford to go it alone and the many problems that we\nface today must be faced by us all in a spirit of\nsolidarity, cooperation and mutual accommodation. We\nneed to be continually engaged and to collaborate so\nthat never again does humanity live the extremely\npainful moments that it lived after 11 September.\nThe United Nations is the forum to address all\nour concerns and we are sure that all countries,\nregardless of their might, understand that there can be\nno substitute for the rule of law, good governance,\ndemocracy and respect for the dignity and rights of the\nindividual. We do recognize the threats posed by\ninternational terrorism and we are all prepared to do\nwhatever has to be done to combat it. It is our hope that\nthis togetherness will not be frittered away when the\nthreat and the danger have disappeared. The world has\nwalked away on too many occasions in the past. From\n16\n\nnow on, we have to walk together and pave the way for\na better world.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate the President\non his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\nthe General Assembly and thank him for his successful\nefforts to take forward the work of this Assembly. My\ncolleague, Foreign Minister Louis Michel of Belgium,\nhas already addressed this General Assembly on behalf\nof the European Union. Ireland associates itself fully\nwith his remarks.\nWe meet at a moment of uncertainty. The spectre\nof war once again casts its shadow across the\ncontinents. Forty years ago, when addressing the\nAssembly, President John F. Kennedy warned:\nMankind must put an end to war or war will put an\nend to mankind. Of course, President Kennedy was\naddressing a different world from the one we now live\nin. The war he feared was a war between two great\npower blocs that would end in assured mutual\nannihilation.\nThankfully, the threat of conflict on such a scale\nis now a far more remote prospect, but war and conflict\ncontinue to cause enormous suffering in many parts of\nthe world. This, together with the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction  nuclear, chemical and\nbiological  means that war and its mutation,\nterrorism, continue to threaten mankind  our lives,\nour liberty and our prosperity.\nThis is simply not acceptable. We, the peoples of\nthe United Nations, created, joined and sustained this\nOrganization in the determination to save this and\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We\nmust now demonstrate renewed and sustained\ncommitment to the realization of this goal.\nMany speakers in this debate have spoken about\nthe events of 11 September as a defining moment in\nhistory. During the twentieth century, we faced a\nnumber of such defining moments  the First World\nWar, the Second World War and the fall of the Berlin\nWall, which heralded the end of the cold war. These\ndefining moments are perhaps best reflected in the\npopular phrase found on the lips of men and women of\nall races and creeds at such times: Things will never\nbe the same again. Out of such defining moments\nthere comes the resolve to learn the lessons of history,\nto change the existing order and to make sure the\ncalamities of the past can never happen again.\n26\n\nIn the heat and clarity of the immediate aftermath\nof such events, expressions of resolve are abundant.\nAnd yet, from the examples I have just outlined, it is\nclear that in the past our resolve has faltered as the\nimmediate threat receded and that the determination\nrequired to tackle the underlying causes and injustices\nthat give rise to conflict has proved difficult to sustain.\nToday the international community is again at a\ncrossroads. If we want a true and lasting victory over\ninternational terrorism; if we want safety, security and\nprosperity for our own people and our children, then\nwe must act with sustained resolve and sustained\ndetermination.\nOur immediate agenda is clear. Action against\nterrorism must be pursued resolutely across a wide\nfront and over a sustained period. In undertaking this\nnecessary endeavour, let us be honest and realistic.\nWith retributive justice must come distributive justice.\nThe peace and security which we crave for ourselves\nand for future generations will not be secured unless\nwe simultaneously tackle the root causes of conflict:\ninjustice, poverty and the abuse of fundamental rights\nand freedoms.\nToo often, multilateral action has been\ncharacterized as reaction to the outcomes of conflict.\nLast year's Millennium Declaration confirmed the\npublic commitment of the world's leadership to\nresolving also the root causes of conflict. The United\nNations was created out of the determination to tackle\nconflict and its causes. On that basis, let us this week\nrecommit and rededicate ourselves to the achievement\nof the goals and objectives of the United Nations. As\nthe Secretary-General pointed out when opening this\ngeneral debate, none of the issues that faced us on 10\nSeptember has become less urgent.\nWe must act more resolutely through the United\nNations, with sustained commitment and sustained\ndetermination, to address this equally urgent agenda.\nWe must implement with determination all Security\nCouncil resolutions. Let us realize and build on the\npledges we made at the Millennium Summit. Let us\nstrive much more effectively to control the spread of\nweapons of mass destruction. Let us also improve the\nworking of this Organization by making it more\nefficient, adaptable and coordinated. In the words of\nthe Secretary-General this week, let us ensure that\nwhen the United Nations acts, only the best is good\nenough. Only in this way will the United Nations and\nits Member States succeed in overcoming the massive\nchallenges which now confront us.\nIn addressing this comprehensive agenda, we\nmust not relax our efforts on human rights. This\nOrganization was founded out of a determination to\nassert human rights, the dignity and worth of the\nhuman person and the equal rights of men and women.\nWe must not equivocate on any of these principles. In\npursuit of this, Ireland looks forward to the imminent\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\nappeals for its universal recognition.\nViolent conflict and internal strife are the reality\nof daily life in many regions and countries across the\nworld today  the Middle East, the Great Lakes region\nof Africa and many other places, such as Sudan, where\npeople are being killed and maimed. Ireland has\nworked hard since joining the Security Council last\nJanuary to focus on the need to address these and other\nconflicts. We have given particular attention to Africa\nand to the efforts, frequently African-led, to solve the\nmany conflicts there. We have consistently sought to\nhighlight the humanitarian aspects of the various\nsituations coming before the Council. We were\nparticularly gratified during our presidency of the\nSecurity Council last month to have presided over\nsubstantial discussions on Somalia and on the United\nNations support for post-independence East Timor.\nWe remain concerned about the humanitarian\nsituation of the people of Iraq. The Iraqi Government\ncan and must do more within the system set out in the\nSecurity Council resolutions to meet the humanitarian\nneeds of its own people. For its part, the Security\nCouncil and its members must redouble their efforts to\nreach agreement on the outcome of its review of the\nsanctions regime. But we must not lose sight of the\nfundamental purpose of the sanctions regime: Iraq must\nallow verification that it has met its essential\ndisarmament obligations.\nThe Irish Government is grateful to those\nMember States that supported Ireland's membership in\nthe Security Council. We will continue to strive to\nvindicate the confidence that you placed in us.\nThe United Nations role in peacekeeping has\nbeen at the heart of our collective endeavours now for\nover 50 years. Ireland has played a proud part in\nUnited Nations peacekeeping across the continents.\nThis evening, I want to take a moment to thank the\nIrish soldiers who have served with such distinction\n27\n\nand dedication in Lebanon for the last 23 years. The\nlast Irish battalion leaves the United Nations Interim\nForce in Lebanon tomorrow. The people of Ireland are\nproud of their service and achievements in the cause of\npeace. I want to pay special tribute to the memory of\nthose soldiers who lost their lives in the service of\npeace.\nIreland's commitment to United Nations\npeacekeeping remains undiminished. We continue to\nparticipate in about a dozen missions. A new\ncontingent of our troops will soon begin service with\nthe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nWe must equally give priority to achieving\nsustainable development and meeting the humanitarian\nchallenges that confront us. The United Nations\nPopulation Fund's 2001 The State of World Population\nreport, published last week, reminds us that half of the\nworld's 6.1 billion people still exist on less than $2 per\nday and forecasts that the world population will rise by\n50 per cent, to 9.3 billion, by the year 2050. Is it\nacceptable that over 3 billion people are today living in\ntotal and abject poverty, while the developed world is\nstruggling to come to terms with the problems of over-\nconsumption and environmental pollution? Are we\nprepared to accept that there could be over 6 billion\npeople living in poverty by 2050?\nLet us see every Government set out its\ncommitment to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product for development assistance within the\nnext five years. Ireland has already made it clear that it\nwill deliver on its commitment in this regard and will\nincrease its overseas development aid budget by over\n$100 million next year to keep on track towards this\ntarget. Let us reassess the sustainable debt levels and\nprovide additional relief to the heavily indebted poor\ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa, which will suffer the\nmost in the present economic downturn.\nLet us redouble our efforts to overcome an\nHIV/AIDS pandemic which is killing over 6.5\nthousand people every day in Africa and which has\nalready orphaned over 9 million children on that\ncontinent. The Declaration of Commitment agreed at\nthe General Assembly special session in June has\nestablished the framework and the targets. It now has\nto be financed and implemented.\nLet us work harder together to prevent climate\nchange from devastating poor and vulnerable countries.\nWe have achieved much already. This is\nrecognized by the awarding of this year's Nobel Peace\nPrize jointly to our Organization and to our esteemed\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. I offer my warmest\ncongratulations and appreciation to Kofi Annan, and to\nall who serve the United Nations. But the Secretary-\nGeneral would be the first to emphasize that the award\nof the Nobel Peace Prize must be seen not only as a\nrecognition of past achievement, but as an inspiration\nto renewed commitment and determination.\nThe terrible events of 11 September, which struck\nmost fiercely at the city of New York  seat of the\nUnited Nations and melting pot of all races and\ncreeds  brought home to us all that the collective\nsecurity of the international community is only as\nstrong as its weakest link. As long as a single\nGovernment or, in the case of the Taliban, a single de\nfacto administration, is prepared to allow its territory to\nbe used as a base for terrorist attacks against people\nanywhere on this planet, we can never feel secure.\nWe must confront and defeat the scourge of\ninternational terrorism and bring those responsible for\nthe barbaric acts of 11 September to justice, not out of\na need for revenge, but because the perpetrators of\nthese acts are capable of repeating such attacks and\nmake no secret of their determination to do so. They\ncan and must be stopped.\nIreland's position has been steadfast and clear: we\nstand with the United States and with the rest of the\ninternational community in asserting that the barbarism\nof 11 September cannot be allowed to succeed; that the\nthreat posed by international terrorism must be\npermanently ended; and that there must be a total\ncommitment by all Governments to this task, with all\nthe energy and resources at our disposal.\nMy Government hopes that the military campaign\nnow under way will achieve its objectives in as short a\ntime frame as possible. Every effort must continue to\nbe made to avoid civilian casualties, and it is crucial\nthat the military campaign be accompanied by a visible\nand effective humanitarian strategy. The long-suffering\npeople of Afghanistan deserve no less. There must also\nbe a concerted international effort, coordinated by the\nUnited Nations, to assist the people of Afghanistan in\nestablishing a broad-based Government, representative\nof all the ethnic groups which make up the country.\nThis must be accompanied by a comprehensive and\ngenerous programme of support for the post-military\n28\n\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. The\ninternational community must stay engaged once a\nrepresentative Government is established there.\nIn Ireland, we continue to make steady progress\nwith our own peace process. As representatives will be\naware, the British and Irish Governments and the\npolitical parties in Northern Ireland successfully\nnegotiated a comprehensive peace settlement over three\nyears ago, known as the Good Friday Agreement. Since\nthen, we have worked hard to secure the full\nimplementation of this Agreement.\nTwo of the most difficult and sensitive issues we\nhave had to face were the putting of paramilitary\nweapons beyond use and the putting in place of a new\nbeginning to policing. I am very pleased to be able to\ninform the Assembly that very considerable progress\nhas recently been made on both these crucial issues. As\na result, the way is now clear for a sustained,\ncommitted and enthusiastic implementation of all\nelements of the Good Friday Agreement.\nWe have learned a lot from our own voyage\ntowards peace. We have put in place new constitutional\nand institutional arrangements, which fully recognize\nand respect the legitimacy of both political traditions\non the island of Ireland. We have established the\nprimacy and full relevance of politics in people's lives\nin Northern Ireland. We do not pretend, of course, that\nwe have found a solution that has universal\napplication  we know too well how local and\nindividual conflicts can be. But through our own\nprocess of trial and error we have learned lessons and\nestablished principles that may be useful in resolving\nconflicts in other parts of the world. From our own\nexperience of peace-building, we enumerate the most\nimportant elements of any truly sustainable peace\nprocess as follows.\nThere can be no purely military solution. A\nlasting settlement must always address the root causes\nof conflict. Compromise is essential. Recognizing that\nextremism breeds in the absence of reason, conflict\nresolution demands that we rehabilitate the concept of\ncompromise. In the context of effective political\ndialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes,\npeacemakers should not regard compromise as\nrepresenting appeasement or surrender, victory or\ndefeat. Neither does compromise necessarily require\nsplitting the difference between the parties. A lasting\nagreement must be comprehensive and address all\nissues of concern, even if the parties might agree to\ndeal with them in different time frames.\nThose in favour of peace in each community must\nwork together, even in the face of hostility from the\nenemies of the peace process in their own community.\nThey must stick together in adversity. They must avoid\nexcessive and damaging criticism when mistakes are\nmade, as they inevitably will be. They must be\nprepared to face down the enemies of peace together.\nThe international community must support the\npeace process in a balanced and objective way. A\nsuccessful process needs a route map, such as those\nalready prepared by Mitchell and Tenet in the context\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also needs a\nmechanism to arbitrate on who is meeting, and who is\nnot meeting, their commitments under any such\narrangements.\nThose driving the peace process must rise above\nthe politics of the last atrocity. Not doing so, while\nunderstandable in terms of domestic opinion, is\nultimately bereft of vision and hands control over\nprogress to the enemies of the process. There is a\nparticularly compelling message here for those charged\nwith advancing the peace process in the Middle East. If\nthese elements are present, we believe a peace process\ncan prosper.\nAs I have already said, there is no one size fits\nall solution to conflict. I believe, however, that if\nthese principles were to be applied in certain other\nconflict situations, they could make a significant\ncontribution to the achievement of peace and political\nprogress.\nThe world we seek cannot be brought about\novernight. Building peace, ensuring justice, widening\nrespect for fundamental human rights and eliminating\npoverty will take time. We will require stamina,\ndetermination, inspiration, patience, generosity and\ncompromise. We have all these qualities in abundance\nif only we can find the political will to use them and\nthe determination, together, to seek new ways forward.\n\n\n\n"

We also want to\nexpress our sincerest thanks and appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, former Prime Minister\nof the friendly country of the Republic of Finland. We\nthank him for his efforts in directing the work of the\nlast session and the various special sessions that took\nplace during his term.\n35\n\nI want to take this opportunity to reiterate my\nsincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr.\nKofi Annan, and to the United Nations itself on being\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a well-deserved\naward and a mark of distinction for the contributions\nand the remarkable role played by the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations in the maintenance and\nthe strengthening of international peace and security.\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also want to\nexpress my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on being granted a second term of office at the\nhead of the Organization. We intend to cooperate with\nhim in the attainment of our objectives, in the\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United\nNations Charter and in the preparation and\ndevelopment of mechanisms for international\ncooperation in all fields.\nThe terrible events of 11 September that struck\nthis city, which is host to our Organization, have been\nforcefully condemned by my Government. This city\nhas attracted people from all over the world to a\ndialogue among civilizations through our international\nOrganization, and it therefore deserves to be a city of\npeace, not of terror and violence. We therefore take this\nopportunity to express once again our sincerest\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the\nfriendly American people, whose sorrow we share. The\nworld was horrified by this dangerous turn of events \u2014\nthe terrorist acts that struck such vital sites in New\nYork and Washington, taking many lives and leaving\ngreat destruction in their wake.\nWhile expressing our solidarity with the friendly\ncountry of the United States of America in its struggle\nagainst terrorism and in the defence of its territory and\nits people, and while we understand the reasons for the\nmilitary action being taken in Afghanistan, it is our\nfervent hope that every effort will be made to spare\ninnocent civilians the destruction and disasters of war\nso that they will not suffer further tragedies. For its\npart, the international community must play its role in\nprotecting the Afghan people.\nWe must not forget the peaceful means of dealing\nwith terrorism. Every sincere effort must be made to\neliminate the scourge of terrorism, which will destroy\ncivilization and all the achievements of humankind if it\nis not firmly confronted and if its causes are not\nexamined and uprooted. We stress that the use of\nmilitary force is not the best or the only solution for\neliminating terrorist groups. We appeal for a long-term\nvision to prevail so that all elements of the problem can\nbe dealt with. In this respect, we reiterate our\nwelcoming of the Egyptian proposal for an\ninternational conference on the fight against terrorism\nin order to arrive at an effective, binding international\ninstrument for States.\nIn the midst of this tragedy, we have heard certain\nopportunistic political circles in States and at the\ninternational level linking terrorism to Islam and\nMuslims. We fully and categorically reject this. Islam\nis a religion of mercy for all, a religion based on\nfraternity and tolerance. Muslims are the bearers of a\ncivilization, a culture and noble human and\nhumanitarian values. This is why the Organization of\nthe Islamic Conference, at its extraordinary session\nheld in Doha, Qatar, last October, totally dissociated\nitself from all terrorism and reiterated its condemnation\nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The\nsession\u2019s final communiqu\u00e9 reported in paragraph 3\nthat the Conference\n\u201cstressed that such shameful terror acts are\nopposed to the tolerant, divine message of Islam\nwhich spurns aggression, calls for peace,\ncoexistence, tolerance and respect among people,\nhighly prizes the dignity of human life and\nprohibits killing of the innocent. It further\nrejected any attempts alleging the existence of\nany connection or relation between the Islamic\nfaith and the terrorist acts as such attempts are\nnot in the interest of the multilateral efforts to\ncombat terrorism and further damage relations\namong peoples of the world. It stressed as well\nthe need to undertake a joint effort to promote\ndialogue and create links or contacts between the\nIslamic world and the West in order to reach\nmutual understanding and build bridges of\nconfidence between the two civilizations.\u201d\nIn this respect, my delegation wishes to\nemphasize its categorical rejection of the calls of all\nthose who would like to use this human disaster to\nsettle old scores and old political differences and to\nexpand the field of military action to other areas under\nthe pretext of fighting terrorism.\nWe are concerned about the humanitarian\nsituation of the friendly Afghan people. International\nhumanitarian organizations report that the military\naction taking place in Afghanistan has caused hundreds\n36\n\nof civilian casualties, that hundreds of thousands have\nbeen displaced and that the civilian population is\nexperiencing severe living conditions. Humanitarian\norganizations have warned that a humanitarian disaster\ncould be imminent for the Afghan people, especially\nwith the approach of winter. My country supports\ninternational efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the\nAfghan people, especially through the recent resolution\nadopted at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\nConference of the Islamic Conference with a view to\ncreating a fund for this purpose.\nThe series of difficult and painful events in the\npeace process in the Middle East on all its tracks and at\nall its stages, particularly regarding the Palestinian\naspect of the question, confirms that in order to arrive\nat a just, comprehensive and lasting peace it is\nnecessary to work towards implementing Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well\nas all other relevant United Nations resolutions that\ndemand the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab\nterritories occupied in 1967 and recognition of the\nlegitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and to the establishment of its own\nindependent State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its\ncapital. This is a basic, just and legitimate demand for\nthe purpose of consolidating the pillars of peace and\nstability in the region. We express our full support for\nthese just demands of the Palestinian people who are\nfully entitled to use all means available to them to put\nan end to the Israeli occupation of their territory.\nThe Islamic countries also support the right of the\nPalestinian people because of the justness of their\ncause. Theirs is a legitimate right recognized and\nguaranteed by all international norms and instruments.\nThe Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations and\nthe Security Council to assume their full responsibility\nto have Israel implement all relevant Security Council\nand international resolutions and to stop the collective\npunishment of the Palestinian people.\nFollowing the Madrid Peace Conference, in 1991,\nthe region was full of hope and optimism. It seemed as\nthough peace were becoming a reality. Many\nagreements had been reached, from Oslo to Sharm el-\nSheikh, and all the parties had embarked on dialogue\nwith one another in circumstances that were not ideal.\nNonetheless, despite all the missteps, peace moved\nforward, because peace was the ultimate goal that\neveryone eagerly sought. The Arabs believed in peace.\nThey had agreed to it as an irreversible strategic option\nbased on the principles of Islam, which advocates\ntolerance and peace, and because they were convinced\nthat peace alone would make prosperity, stability and\ndevelopment possible.\nThe Sultanate of Oman has therefore supported\nevery effort, with a view to achieving that much-\ndesired peace based on justice, fairness and the legality\nof international resolutions and the principle of land for\npeace. But Israel deviated from those principles,\ninventing its own concept of peace. Israel has used\nevery possible means of imposing its own kind of\npeace. Israel does not really want the peace that the\nworld is considering. Israel wants its own special kind\nof peace. It wants the international community to go\nalong with the current reality \u2014 the occupation of\nterritory, without giving the Palestinians any role or a\nState. This is why violence in the region is a dynamic\nof action and reaction. This is why there has been\nbloodshed and why life and property continue to be\ndestroyed. Will the world stand by and watch the\nkilling of innocents, the murder of the elderly and\nchildren?\nThe Sultanate of Oman therefore invites the two\nsponsors of the peace process \u2014 the United States of\nAmerica and the Russian Federation \u2014 and the\nSecretary-General to play their role so that the situation\ncan return to normal and so that the peace process, in\nall its aspects, can be revived and resumed from the\npoint where it left off.\nMy Government supports the just position of the\nfraternal Syrian Arab Republic. Its actions are aimed at\nrecovering the occupied territory of the Golan Heights\nand at ensuring Israel\u2019s withdrawal to the 4 June 1967\nborder. In our opinion, it is in Israel\u2019s interest to\nresume the negotiations, in accordance with the\nprinciples of international law and international\nresolutions including Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the principle of land\nfor peace, in order to lay the foundation for peace and\nsecurity, so that an effective partnership can be built\nand a lasting, stable and viable relationship based on\nmutual interests among the States of the region can be\nestablished and consolidated.\nMy Government also asks Israel to work towards\nthe full implementation of Security Council resolution\n425 (1978), which calls upon Israel to withdraw from\nall Lebanese territory. The Shab\u2019a farms area is an\nintegral part of Lebanese territory and is covered by\n37\n\nthat resolution. It is in Israel\u2019s interest to withdraw\nfrom that territory in order to broaden the prospects of\npeace and to strengthen peace and stability, which\neveryone desires.\nThe imposition of sanctions as a political\nmechanism means that Governments must fulfil their\nobligations under international resolutions. However,\nwe see that this policy has become a weapon that\njeopardizes the fundamental rights of peoples. This is\nunacceptable. Hence, it is important that the Security\nCouncil seek effective policies and mechanisms that\ntake into account the extent to which resolutions have\nbeen implemented by the countries to which those\nresolutions are addressed, such as Iraq, Libya and\nothers.\nDespite all the serious international and regional\nefforts to relieve the suffering of the fraternal Iraqi\npeople, we note that the overall situation in Iraq and\nthe future of the Iraqi people are becoming increasingly\nproblematic because of the economic embargo imposed\non them in 1990. That is also the view of the\nhumanitarian and international agencies and\norganizations in Iraq.\nThe Sultanate of Oman supports all efforts to lift\ncompletely the economic sanctions against Iraq. At the\nsame time, we call upon the Iraqi Government to\ncooperate constructively with the United Nations in\norder to implement the remaining relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, particularly regarding prisoners of\nwar, missing Kuwaitis and missing persons from third\nStates.\nThe Sultanate of Oman warmly welcomes the\nwise approach of our brethren in Bahrain and Qatar.\nThose two countries have proceeded to implement the\nJudgment of the International Court of Justice of 16\nMarch 2001. That positive approach by those two\nfraternal countries has eliminated many sources of\ntension and has made a genuine contribution to the\nestablishment of peace, security and stability in the\nregion.\nMy Government is gratified by the friendly\nofficial contacts between the United Arab Emirates and\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, which will enable those\ntwo countries to agree on joint means to put an end to\ntheir dispute over the three islands belonging to the\nEmirates.\nThe political, economic, social and cultural\nchanges taking place in today\u2019s world mean that\nAfrican countries and their leaders must work hard to\nbuild trust among their peoples and their countries so\nthat they can cooperate on the basis of common interest\nand constructive dialogue and so that they can take\nlocal measures and initiatives to resolve all their\ndisputes and to solve the refugee problem. We call on\nthe international community, as represented by the\nUnited Nations, to take equitable measures to improve\nthe situation in Africa and to make it possible to\nresolve its political, economic, social and health\nproblems.\nBecause of the great importance that the\nSultanate of Oman attaches to development, we are\npleased that the first International Conference on\nFinancing for Development will take place in Mexico\nin 2002 and that this date is in the near future. We\nappreciate the value of dialogue between the rich\ncountries of the North and the countries of the South\nthat are bedevilled by social and environmental\nproblems, and we hope that contacts and dialogue\nbetween the two groups will increase genuine\ncooperation and coordination among States in all\nfields, with a view to narrowing the economic and\ntechnological gap between their peoples.\nOver the past 30 years of Oman\u2019s development\nprocess, my Government has constantly worked to\nbalance development and environmental protection.\nSuch efforts have been successful thanks to His\nMajesty the Sultan\u2019s declaration of 2001 as the Year of\nthe Environment. In the framework of our contribution\nand of our interest in global environmental issues, we\nhave pledged that we will sign all conventions and\ntreaties aimed at protecting the Earth\u2019s environment.\nMy country today appeals to developed countries to\nmeet the commitments they undertook at the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\nheld at Rio de Janeiro, especially with respect to the\nprovision of technical assistance to developing\ncountries.\nIn the light of the importance of integration into\nthe world economy, my country officially joined the\nWorld Trade Organization on 9 November 2000. We\nhope thus to enhance the role and the level of our trade\nand industrial organizations and services and to ensure\nthat they are duly integrated into world markets. My\ncountry has undertaken great economic reforms to\nliberalize trade and investment. We have also enacted\n38\n\nmany laws and have strengthened our mechanisms and\nregulations in these areas.\nI should mention that, on 20 December 2000 at\nNew York, the Sultanate of Oman signed the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. We hope to\ncomplete the ratification process and thus to accede to\nthis new organ of international law, which is aimed at\nbringing to justice those who violate human rights and\ncommit crimes against humanity, wherever they may\nbe.\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his annual\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/56/1). It sets\nout the achievements of the United Nations while\ndescribing the obstacles in its way, and it charts a\ncourse for the future to strengthen our work towards\nthe purposes for which the United Nations was\nestablished. In his report, the Secretary-General also\ndiscusses the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration and its ambitious recommendations. We\nmust be ready now to endorse visions that would\nstrengthen the United Nations and restructure it in line\nwith current realities. That includes enlargement of the\nSecurity Council in a manner proportionate to the\noverall membership of the international community. In\nthat way the Organization can serve as an effective\nintermediary in international life and a source of\ninternational law.\nIt is our hope that this session will be successful,\nand that it will set out a vision of the future that will\ndefine the contours of future action for the benefit of\nall mankind.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish\nto pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, upon his unanimous re-election. The Nobel\nPeace Prize conferred upon the United Nations and its\nSecretary-General testifies to the broad recognition of\nthe increasing role played by the world Organization in\npromoting peace, security and development and vests\nin it, at the same time, greater responsibility and trust\nin meeting both the existing and evolving global\nchallenges.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\nplace at a time when the international community is\ndrawn together more closely in the face of the\nunprecedented task of developing an effective response\nto the challenge of terrorism. The people and\nGovernment of Mongolia have resolutely condemned\nthe barbaric attacks of 11 September as a deliberate act\nof terrorism against freedom and democracy \u2014 an\nattack against all humanity and expressed its full\nsupport for the collective efforts of the anti-terrorist\ncoalition. From this high rostrum, I wish to reaffirm\nMongolia\u2019s strong commitment to our common\n7\n\nstruggle against the scourge of terrorism. I wish, on\nbehalf of the Government of Mongolia, to reiterate our\nprofound sympathy to the people and Government of\nthe United States of America and to all the families that\nhave been affected by this tragic event. I also express\nmy condolences to New Yorkers and to the\nGovernments of the United States of America and the\nDominican Republic over the tragic accident that took\nplace yesterday here in New York.\nThe response of the international community to\nthe terrorist attacks has clearly demonstrated its firm\nresolve to collectively fight this global scourge. In this\nrespect, Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\nSeptember is a timely measure, unprecedented both in\nits scope and nature. It has laid the groundwork for\npractical measures to be taken by all Member States in\nthe fight against terrorism and established an effective\nmechanism to monitor its implementation. My\nGovernment is taking every necessary measure to\nimplement the provisions of the resolution and the\nrelevant report to that effect was submitted to the\ncounter-terrorism Committee of the Security Council\non 10 November.\nI wish also to inform the Assembly that Mongolia\nsigned yesterday the 1999 International Convention for\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. With its\nratification in the near future, Mongolia will be party to\nall the United Nations anti-terrorism conventions\napplicable to it. We also believe that, in light of recent\nevents, the existing international legal framework on\nterrorism ought to be further strengthened through the\nspeedy conclusion of a comprehensive convention\nagainst international terrorism and a convention against\nnuclear terrorism, preferably at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. In the same vein, the pace of setting\nup the International Criminal Court must be\naccelerated.\nIn order to put the anti-terrorist strategy in the\nright perspective, it would seem important to us to see\nthe problem in a wider setting, that is, to address issues\nthat provide a fertile soil for terrorism, such as\ntransnational organized crime, illicit drugs, money\nlaundering, illegal arms trafficking and others. The\nUnited Nations, in our view, is uniquely positioned to\nmeet such a challenge and to develop a comprehensive\nstrategy to uproot international terrorism through\nglobal and concerted action.\nThe events of 11 September have drastically\nchanged the world as we see it. It has revealed the\nheightened vulnerability of the human family. It has\nalso revealed, in no uncertain terms, the need for\nchange in our approach to the way we perceive our\nown security. In this regard, the concept of human\nsecurity, which places the safety, security and well-\nbeing of a human being at the heart of the matter,\ndeserves our utmost attention. We see the prime merit\nof the human security concept to be that it addresses in\na comprehensive manner the three-tiered freedom\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration: freedom from\nwant, freedom from fear and freedom to live in a\nhealthier and cleaner environment.\nIn the emerging era of globalization, it is\nbecoming increasingly evident that no country can\nensure its security on its own. This indivisibility of\nglobal human security requires a genuine display of\nsolidarity and collective responsibility on the part of\nevery country of the international community so that it\ncan effectively address the formidable challenges at the\nturn of the new millennium.\nAfter several decades of development efforts, the\nnumber of the world\u2019s poor remains at an\nembarrassingly high level. Exclusion, marginalization\nand inequality among and within countries are being\nfurther exacerbated by both existing and evolving\ntransboundary threats.\nLooking back, one could describe the decade of\nthe 1990s as a decade of commitments for\ndevelopment, with a series of international conferences\nand summits resulting in important declarations and\nplans of action. Yet today, the world finds itself in\nmany respects in no better shape. The legitimate\nquestion arises: Why? Does the international\ncommunity, increasingly seen as a single human family\nliving in a shared global village, have the capacity to\nredress this situation? Technically, the right answer\nseems to be yes. There are resources \u2014 financial,\nhuman and technological \u2014 to ensure a better life. On\nthe other hand, one has to admit also that the\nunderlying reasons could be manifold, as the changes\nundergone and challenges faced by the world over the\nlast decade are indeed complex both in nature and in\nscope.\nYet, we cannot but agree with the Secretary-\nGeneral that\n8\n\n\u201cThe widening gap between goals and\nachievements implies that the international\ncommunity has failed to deliver on crucial\ncommitments it made during the 1990s\u201d.\n(A/56/326, para. 81)\nThe real, hard question is then: Do we have the\nsufficient political will and sense of solidarity to forge\nthe genuine partnership needed to erase the staggering\ndiscrepancy between commitments and action? In the\nfinal analysis, the answer to this question has to be\naffirmative and has to be supported by practical,\nmeaningful action. We cannot afford to fail to honour\nfor yet another decade our commitments if we are\nserious about ensuring human security. We cannot\nafford to fail to implement the far-reaching yet\nachievable targets set by the Millennium Summit last\nyear. Our failure could be used as a justification for\ndeadly acts by those who pose a threat to humanity. Let\nus therefore make the first decade of this new century\none of implementation and cooperation for a safer,\nhealthier and better world. Additional efforts are\nurgently required, and affluent countries could exhibit\ntheir solidarity and shared responsibility by further\nopening their markets, providing broader and faster\ndebt relief and giving more and better-focused\ndevelopment assistance and incentives for foreign\ndirect investment flows to their less fortunate partners.\nWe must mobilize the political will necessary to\nmake the upcoming conferences on financing for\ndevelopment, sustainable development and food\nsecurity a success. The lead-up to these important\nevents and the conferences themselves are to take into\nconsideration the special needs of small, vulnerable\nand structurally disadvantaged economies so as to\nenable them to integrate into the multilateral trading\nsystem and take advantage of the opportunities offered\nby the advance of globalization. We also believe that\nthe international ministerial meeting on transit\ntransport cooperation, to be held in 2003, is of crucial\nimportance in enhancing international cooperation to\nease the inherent development handicaps of the\nlandlocked developing countries, as recognized in the\nMillennium Declaration.\nMy delegation shares the view that a commitment\nto human security demands enhanced international\ncooperation in conflict prevention and strengthened\ncapacities to assist countries in restoring, building and\nkeeping the peace. In this respect, Mongolia fully\nsupports the Secretary-General in his efforts to move\nthe United Nations from a culture of reaction to a\nculture of prevention. We believe that mutual\nunderstanding and dialogue among different peoples\nand civilizations are acutely needed to break the pattern\nof mistrust, suspicion and recrimination that either lead\nto a conflict or serve as a pretext for it. We know that\nmutual understanding and dialogue are possible when\nthere is cooperation between nations.\nThis session of the General Assembly is of\nspecial significance to my country and its people, as we\ncelebrate the fortieth anniversary of Mongolia\u2019s\nadmission to the United Nations. On 27 October 1961\nMongolia became a full-fledged member of the world\nOrganization, an event of historic importance to my\npeople. Over the years our cooperation with the\norganizations of the United Nations family has been\nexpanding both in scope and in substance. Today\nMongolia is party to some 140 international treaties\nand conventions, and is a member of 33 inter-\ngovernmental and 20 regional and other organizations.\nThe United Nations assistance and cooperation has\nbeen instrumental in developing human resources,\ncapacity-building, education, health and information\ntechnology, reducing poverty, protecting the\nenvironment and developing an adequate response to\nnatural disasters.\nWithin the framework of the fortieth anniversary,\nwe have been undertaking a host of activities to take\nstock of our past cooperation with the organizations of\nthe United Nations system and identify priority areas\nfor future cooperation. This culminated in the joint\nconference organized by the Government of Mongolia\nand the United Nations on 3 September, in Ulaanbaatar,\nunder the theme \u201cForty Years of Mongolia-United\nNations Cooperation: Implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration\u201d. The main thrust of the\ndiscussions and conclusions of that conference has\nbeen incorporated into the memorandum of the\nGovernment of Mongolia on the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration, which has been circulated as\nan official document of this session of the General\nAssembly.\nOver the last four decades of our cooperation,\nMongolia has been endeavouring to contribute, where\nit could, to the common efforts of the international\ncommunity to promote peace, cooperation and\ndevelopment. My delegation is proud to recall that on\nthe initiative of Mongolia the General Assembly\nadopted the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to\n9\n\nPeace, the principles and guidelines for international\nnegotiations, resolutions to observe annually a\nDisarmament Week and relevant resolutions on the\nimportance of human resources, cooperatives, rural\nwomen and the special needs of the landlocked\ndeveloping countries. Furthermore, as a strong\nadvocate of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts\nof the world, in 1992 Mongolia declared its own\nterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and has been\nworking to further institutionalize this.\nRecognizing the crucial role of education in\nensuring sustainable human development and human\nsecurity, my delegation is pleased to note that this\nsession of the General Assembly is about to proclaim,\non Mongolia\u2019s initiative, the 10-year period beginning\n1 January 2003 the United Nations decade for literacy.\nMongolia supports peacekeeping operations as\none of the important means of maintaining\ninternational peace and security. Since the mid-1990s,\nMongolia has taken deliberate steps and made\nmeasurable progress in developing its peacekeeping\ncapability. Showing its willingness to contribute to the\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions through direct\nparticipation, in 1999 Mongolia signed a memorandum\nof understanding with the United Nations on standby\narrangements regarding the provision of staff officers,\nmilitary observers and medical officers. Mongolia\nstands ready to actively cooperate with the United\nNations and to make a practical contribution to its\npeacekeeping operations.\nAs a member of the Conference on Disarmament,\nMongolia cannot but fully agree with the Secretary-\nGeneral, in paragraph 77 of his report on the work of\nthe Organization (A/56/1), that the \u201clevel of\ninternational cooperation in disarmament remains\ndisappointingly low.\u201d In order to bring the Conference\non Disarmament out of its ongoing stalemate it may\nseem advisable to give political impetus to the\ndisarmament agenda by convening a Security Council\nmeeting at the highest level or holding one of the future\nsessions of the Conference on Disarmament at the level\nof Foreign Ministers.\nIn recent years Mongolia has been an active\nparticipant in international activities aimed at\nstrengthening institutions and processes of democratic\ngovernance, protecting human rights and promoting\ndemocratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of\nMongolia guarantees the Mongolian people\nfundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is\nparty to all major international human rights\ninstruments. Earlier this year Mongolia set up an\nindependent National Human Rights Commission.\nYesterday Mongolia signed the two Optional Protocols\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Willing\nto share its fresh experience of peaceful and\nsimultaneous transition to democracy and a market-\noriented economy over the last decade and to learn\nmore from the valuable experiences of other countries,\nMongolia has offered to host the Fifth International\nConference of New or Restored Democracies in 2003\nin Ulaanbaatar.\nThe task of ensuring human security and\npromoting human-centred development is high on the\nagenda of my Government, as envisaged in its\nprogramme of action. Recognizing the importance of\nthe quality of governance in achieving development\ngoals, my Government approved a national programme\non good governance for human security to facilitate the\npolicy focus, coherence and sustainability of its\nprogramme of action. Mongolia has thus become the\nfirst country aspiring to ensure human security through\nbuilding good governance. As we move along this\ntrailblazing path, we are aware of the need for the\nknowledge, expertise, experience and assistance of the\norganizations of the United Nations system and our\nfellow members of the international community.\nThe Government is resolved to ensure sustained\neconomic growth through reinvigorating and\nencouraging the development of domestic industry,\nrehabilitating the banking sector, upgrading the living\nstandards of the people, reducing poverty and\nunemployment, and ensuring equitable social and\neducational opportunities. We will intensify structural\nreforms and encourage an export-oriented, private-\nsector-led economy. Mining, processing of raw\nmaterials of animal origin, tourism and other export-\noriented sectors are the top priority areas of\ndevelopment. Privatization of State assets, including\nthe most valuable State enterprises, will continue. The\ncreation of a favourable environment for the attraction\nof foreign investment is also a priority objective.\nIn its endeavours to carry out simultaneous\neconomic and political reforms Mongolia faces many\nchallenges. On behalf of the Government of Mongolia,\nI wish to express our sincere gratitude and high\nappreciation to our bilateral and multilateral partners\nfor their generous support and cooperation pledged at\n10\n\nthe eighth meeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group,\nheld last May in Paris, demonstrating thus their support\nof my Government\u2019s policy and action.\nMongolia will continue its active participation in\nmultilateral processes and international organizations\nsuch as the United Nations and will spare no effort to\nensure that the world Organization remains a focal\npoint for coordination of the effort of the community of\nnations toward peace and development in the years to\ncome.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI greet you,\nMr. President, and pay tribute to the Republic of Korea,\nwhich offers the world an example of dedication to the\ncause of peace and development.\nI reaffirm my admiration for Secretary-General\nKofi Annan, who, together with the United Nations,\nwas rightfully honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.\nMore than ever, we need his clear vision and courage\nin seeking to build a peaceful and democratic\ninternational order that is based on solidarity. Only\nfanatics fail to acknowledge the great mission\nundertaken by the United Nations and by Kofi Annan.\nIn a tradition that extends back to the beginnings\nof this Organization, the month of September in New\nYork is dedicated to a celebration of dialogue: the\nopening of the general debate of this General\nAssembly. It was not so this year. In New York as well\nas in Washington, the month of September was marked\nby the very denial of this dialogue and understanding\nbetween peoples: the senseless violence resulting from\nan odious and treacherous attack against the United\nStates of America and against all peace- and freedom-\nloving peoples.\nIt was an infamous act of aggression against a\ncity that, perhaps more than any other, is a symbol of\ncosmopolitanism; a city that has welcomed immigrants\nfrom all parts, such as the Dutch Jews of Portuguese\nancestry who, in the seventeenth century, left Brazil for\nwhat was then New Amsterdam.\nNew York has grown, prospered and reached\nmaturity guided by pluralistic values. It became great,\nand was admired, not only because of its Jewish and\nAnglo-Saxon heritage, but also because of its Arab,\nLatin, African, Caribbean and Asian presence. The\nattacks of 11 September 2001 were an act of aggression\nagainst all of those traditions \u2014 an act of aggression\nagainst humanity.\nAs the first head of State to speak in the general\ndebate at this session of the General Assembly, I wish\nto be very clear. As I had occasion to say on the very\nmorning of those horrendous attacks, and as I have said\nduring my conversations with President George W.\nBush, Brazil extends its full solidarity and support to\nthe people of the United States in its response to\nterrorism.\nTo our understanding, the American hemisphere\nas a whole was attacked. That is why we suggested\nconvening the consultative organ of the Inter-American\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Terrorism negates all\nthat the United Nations stands for. It destroys the very\nprinciples of civilized behaviour. It fosters fear, and\nthreatens the security and peace of all countries.\nThe victims of any act of terrorism will not be\nforgotten; nor will the perpetrators of such acts go\nunpunished, whether they are individuals, groups or the\nStates that give them support. The march of folly will\nbe vigorously resisted by the solid alliance of all free\npeoples.\nThe Charter of the United Nations acknowledges\nthe right of Member States to act in self-defence. That\nis not in doubt. But let us keep in mind that the struggle\nagainst terrorism cannot rely exclusively on the\n5\n\neffectiveness of self-defence measures or on the use of\nmilitary force by individual countries.\nIn 1945, the United Nations committed itself to\nthe task of laying the foundations for peace and the\nprotection of future generations against the scourge of\nwar. War always takes a heavy human toll \u2014 a cost in\nlives cut short and lives overtaken by fear and flight.\nThat underscores the responsibility of terrorists for\nwhat is happening today. Brazil hopes that,\nnotwithstanding these circumstances, humanitarian\nassistance efforts in Afghanistan will not be frustrated.\nFurthermore, we will, to the best of our abilities,\nwelcome refugees wishing to settle in our country.\nCertain things may be obvious, but they warrant\nrepeating. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, the\nstruggle against terrorism is not, and must never\nbecome, a clash between civilizations, much less\nbetween religions. Not one of the civilizations that\nhave enriched and humanized our planet has not\nknown, within its own historical experience, episodes\nof violence and terror.\nAround the world, problems related to crime,\ndrug abuse, drug-trafficking and money-laundering are\nevils related to terrorism that must be eradicated. From\nthis rostrum, I would like to call for a worldwide public\nawareness campaign to make drug users in all countries\nrealize that they are helping \u2014 even if inadvertently \u2014\nto finance terrorism.\nIf we are to stem the flow of resources to the\nterrorist networks spreading death and destruction, it is\ncrucial that drug use in our societies be drastically\ncurtailed. Furthermore, we must not allow differences\nin national tax regimes in various countries to be used\nas an instrument to foster capital flight, to the\ndetriment of economic development, or to help finance\norganized crime, including terrorist actions. If the\nexistence of tax havens is inseparable from these\nproblems, then tax havens should not exist. We must\nput an end to such safe harbours for corruption and\nterror, with regard to which some Governments have,\nto date, been complacent.\nIt is only natural that, since 11 September, issues\nof international security should have been given high\npriority. Yet terrorism must not be allowed to stifle the\ndebate on cooperation and other issues of global\ninterest. The road to the future requires the forces of\nglobalization to be harnessed in the pursuit of lasting\npeace \u2014 a peace sustained not by fear, but rather by\nthe willing acceptance by all countries of a just\ninternational order.\nOn this theme, I have sought to mobilize\nnumerous world leaders. Brazil wishes to do its part to\nensure that the world does not squander the\nopportunities that are contained in the present crisis.\nLet us focus on our fundamental imperative of\npromoting development. The process of globalization\nis tainted by an undeniable sense of unease. I am not\nreferring to the ideological disquiet of those who\noppose globalization on principle or who reject the\nvery notion of universal values which inspire freedom\nand the respect for human rights. Rather, I have in\nmind the fact that globalization has not lived up to its\npromises. There is a governance deficit in the\ninternational sphere, and it results from a democratic\ndeficit. Globalization will be sustainable only if\nenriched by a sense of justice. Our aim should be\n\u201cglobalization in solidarity\u201d, rather than the\nasymmetrical globalization of today.\nIn the field of trade, it is high time that\nmultilateral negotiations were translated into greater\naccess for goods from developing countries to the more\nprosperous markets. The ministers meeting in Doha\nhave a heavy responsibility: to ensure that the new\nround of multilateral trade negotiations is a\ndevelopment round. To this end, it is crucial for\npriority to be given to those issues most conducive to\nthe dismantling of protectionist practices and barriers\nin developed countries.\nBrazil has taken the lead in negotiations to ensure\ngreater market access and better humanitarian\nconditions in the fight against disease. We will seek to\nstrike a balance between the requirements of patent\nrights and the imperative of providing care to those\nmost in need. We favour market practices and the\nprotection of intellectual property, but not at the cost of\nhuman lives. This is a point that must be carefully\ndefined: life must prevail over material interests.\nThe Bretton Woods institutions must be revamped\nif they are to respond to the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century. The International Monetary Fund must be\nallotted greater resources so as to allow it to function\nas a lender of last resort. The World Bank and regional\nbanks must be given a more active part in fostering\neconomic growth and development.\nThe volatility of international capital flows must\nbe contained and the financial system made more\n6\n\npredictable and less crisis-prone, as proposed by the\nG-20.\nSimilarly, although measures such as the Tobin\ntax present practical difficulties, it should be possible\nto look into better and less compulsory alternatives. I\nsubmit that these issues should be given special\nattention at the United Nations International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nnext year in Monterrey.\nWe must also envisage practical forms of\ncooperation to alleviate the tragedy of AIDS, above all\nin Africa. How long will the world remain indifferent\nto the plight of those who might yet be saved from\ndisease, deprivation and exclusion?\nThe twentieth century came to an end amid a\ngrowing sense of global citizenship and universally\nshared values. Brazil is determined to forge ahead in\nthis direction.\nThe International Criminal Court will be a\nhistoric victory for the cause of human rights. The\nprotection of the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment are equally pressing challenges of our\ntime. The process of climate change has been\nscientifically ascertained as a fact, but it is not\nunstoppable. What the future holds depends on what\nwe do today, in particular as concerns the Kyoto\nProtocol.\n(spoke in English)\nI have just been informed of the successful\noutcome of the Marrakesh meeting. Brazil warmly\nwelcomes this development, which is a fundamental\nstep towards controlling, and eventually reversing, the\nwarming of the atmosphere. I will submit to the\nCongress a proposal for the prompt ratification of the\nKyoto Protocol.\n(spoke in Portuguese)\nRecent events in this city and elsewhere have\nclearly demonstrated the grave threat posed by\nweapons of mass destruction. No matter the nature of\nthe menace \u2014 be it bacteriological, such as anthrax;\nchemical; or nuclear \u2014 there is no alternative to\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\nIt is an ethical imperative that science and\ntechnology must not be turned into a weapon in the\nhands of the irresponsible. This requires the active and\nlegitimate involvement of the United Nations in the\ncontrol, destruction and eradication of these arsenals.\nJust as it supported the creation of the State of\nIsrael, Brazil today calls for concrete measures towards\nthe setting up of a Palestinian state that is democratic,\nunited and economically viable.\nThe right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination and respect for the existence of Israel as\na sovereign, free and secure State are essential if the\nMiddle East is to rebuild its future in peace.\nThis is a moral debt owed by the United Nations.\nIt is a task that must not be postponed.\nIt is equally urgent that a lasting solution be\nfound to the conflict in Angola, which deserves the\nopportunity to get back on the road to development.\nThis is the same future that Brazil wishes for East\nTimor, which we hope will soon take its rightful place\nin the Assembly as a sovereign state.\nA strong and flexible United Nations is required\nif the world is to respond to increasingly complex\nproblems. The United Nations will only be\nstrengthened if the General Assembly becomes more\nactive and more respected, and if the Security Council\nbecomes more representative. Its composition should\nno longer be a reflection of arrangements among the\nvictors of a conflict that took place over 50 years ago,\nand for whose triumph Brazilian soldiers gave their\nblood in the glorious campaigns in Italy.\nBrazil joins those who appeal for more\ndemocracy in international relations in calling for the\nenlargement of the Security Council. Common sense\nrequires the inclusion, in the category of permanent\nmembers, of those developing countries with the\nnecessary credentials to exercise the responsibilities\nthat today\u2019s world imposes upon them.\nBy the same token, Brazil believes that an\nenlargement of the G-7/G-8 is called for in view of the\ntransformations the world is presently undergoing. It is\nno longer admissible to restrict to such a limited group\nof countries the discussion of issues pertaining to\nglobalization and its inevitable impact on the political\nand economic life of emerging countries.\nAn international order that is more just and based\non solidarity will come about only through a concerted\neffort on the part of the community of nations. This is\n7\n\ntoo precious a goal to be left to the vagaries of market\nforces or to the whims of power politics.\nWe do not aspire to a world government, but we\ncannot sidestep the obligation to ensure that\ninternational relations are not left rudderless, but\nreflect the legitimate aspirations of the majority. The\nnefarious shadow of terrorism points to what can be\nexpected if we do not enhance mutual understanding\namong peoples.\nThis Organization was created under the sign of\ndialogue \u2014 a dialogue among sovereign States that are\nfree nations, whose peoples actively participate in\nnational decision-making.\nWith their help, we can ensure that the twenty-\nfirst century will not be a time of fear, but rather of the\nflourishing of a freer humanity, at peace with itself, and\nrationally oriented towards the building of an\ninternational order that is acceptable to all peoples and\nthat provides a guiding framework for States at the\nglobal level.\nThis is the challenge of the twenty-first century.\nLet us face it inspired by the grand vision of the\nfounding fathers of this Organization, who dreamed of\na pluralistic world, founded on peace, solidarity,\ntolerance and reason, which is the ultimate source of\nthe rule of law.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President on his\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His choice to\nassume this high post is a reflection of Member States'\nappreciation of him personally and their confidence in\nhis ability to conduct the deliberations of this session\nin a manner that would enable it to reach conclusions\nthat would contribute to the strengthening of stability\nand the promotion of development all over the world.\nI would also like to seize this opportunity to\nexpress our gratitude and appreciation to his\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, President of the\nprevious session of the Assembly, which witnessed\nmany activities that have gone a long way towards\nresponding to the common concerns of the\ninternational community.\nOur great appreciation also goes to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, who\ncontinues to perform his duties with dedication and\nrenewed vigour, even under very difficult\n9\n\ncircumstances. His re-election to a second term at the\nhelm of the Organization and the fact that he was\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the\nUnited Nations, this year is testimony to the\nappreciation of his work and the confidence in his\nability to further enhance the role of the United Nations\nand to make it more effective in facing the challenges\nof the new millennium.\nOn 11 September, several American cities,\nincluding the City of New York, which hosts our\nOrganization, were subjected to terrorist attacks to\nwhich thousands of innocent people fell victim. Once\nagain I express to the people of the United States and\nthe families of the victims, who lost their loved ones,\nmy deepest sympathies. We in Libya, having been\nsubjected to various forms of terrorism, including State\nterrorism, realize better than others the cruelty and the\ndepth of feelings that the American people suffered and\nthe psychological impact, particularly on the families\nof the victims. My country has therefore condemned\nthose painful events, emphasizing our firm position,\nwhich denounces terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations and calls for the eradication of this\nphenomenon, which endangers the independence of\nStates and the lives of peoples.\nWe, in Libya appreciate the measures taken by\nthe international community to uproot terrorism,\nincluding the number of agreements made  the most\nimportant of which we are already party to, and the rest\nof which we are in the process of acceding to.\nNevertheless, it is very evident that there is an urgent\nneed to take other measures to confront the challenges\nposed by this phenomenon. This will necessitate\nseeking and eradicating the roots of terrorism. It is also\nimperative to take effective action to put an end to\nterrorist practices and to eliminate all the reasons and\nmotives that stand behind terrorism.\nBefore achieving this, we must agree on a\nuniform definition of terrorism to determine ways of\ncombating it. We cannot condemn terrorism and fight it\nwhen it hits one country and turn a blind eye when it\nhits other countries and peoples. It is also very\ndangerous to link terrorism to a certain religion or\nnationality, as terrorism has no nationality and no\nreligion. Further, it is unacceptable to label as terrorism\nthe struggle of peoples to protect themselves or to\nattain independence while ignoring real terrorism,\nwhich has several faces and is practised in different\nways.\nOccupation, provocation and aggression against\npeoples, like that against Libya in 1986, is all\nterrorism. The establishment of military bases on the\nterritories of others is terrorism. Fleets that roam the\nseas are stationed off the coasts of other States and\nviolate their territorial waters are forms of terrorism.\nThe downing of civilian aircraft, like the Libyan\naircraft that was hijacked and destroyed over Sinai in\n1973, is terrorism. Mass massacres are terrorism. The\ntraining of extreme elements in certain countries and\nfacilitating their arrival in other countries to carry out\ncriminal acts, including assassinations, as happened in\nmy country in 1984 and 1993, is terrorism. The\nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the\nthreat of their use is terrorism. The imposition by one\nState of unilateral, coercive measures against other\ncountries and the enactment by the same State of laws\nto punish others who maintain relations with these\ncountries is also terrorism. Exploiting the Security\nCouncil to impose sanctions against peoples without\nany justification or evidence is terrorism. Preventing\nthe Council from adopting measures to protect those\nwho are subjected to killing and displacement\nconstitutes support for and encouragement of terrorism.\nDue to these considerations, we believe it has\nbecome important and necessary to take international\naction to combat terrorism at all levels. We think that\nsuch action could be effective if undertaken under the\numbrella of the United Nations, in accordance with the\npurposes and principles of its Charter. My country was\namong the first to act in this context when, in 1992, we\ncalled on the Secretary-General of the United Nations\nto request the convening of a special session of the\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of the\nmeans of combating terrorism.\nToday, we renew this call out of a conviction that\nthis is the best way to study the question of terrorism\nwith a view to arriving at an accurate definition of\nterrorism far removed from selfish and subjective\nclassifications. We are also convinced that this is the\nbest way to deal with this phenomenon in all its\npolitical, economic and social aspects and,\nconsequently, to take the necessary measures to fully\nuproot it.\nEvery year, we gather here to review and assess\nour achievements. Despite the tragic events of 11\nSeptember, we notice that the previous year witnessed\na number of important developments. The General\nAssembly held more than one special session. Two\n10\n\nhigh-level conferences were held within the framework\nof the United Nations, one of which was devoted to the\nsituation of the least developed countries and the other,\nto our common struggle against racism and\nxenophobia. In the declarations and programmes of\naction resulting from these conferences, there was a\nrededication and commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations, aimed at maintaining\ninternational peace and security and developing\nfriendly relations among States. It was also affirmed\nthat more efforts would be made to implement\npriorities such as the promotion of development, the\nprovision of shelter for all, the eradication of want and\ndiseases, the ending of injustice and unfairness and the\nuprooting of discrimination in all its forms.\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya participated in all\nthese forums, and we are happy to have contributed to\ntheir successful results. Like other Members of this\nOrganization, we have an interest in the establishment\nof peace, the realization of justice and the support of\nsustainable development. Notwithstanding all these\nachievements, it is abundantly clear that there is a need\nfor further efforts so that we may be able to address the\nadditional challenges facing all Members of the United\nNations.\nOne such challenge is the environmental\ndegradation that threatens life on Earth, our common\nhome. Violence and armed conflicts also rage in\nseveral regions. Millions suffer from abject poverty in\nmany places in developing countries. Diseases,\nparticularly HIV/AIDS, threaten the lives of entire\ncommunities.\nThere are still those who challenge the collective\nwill and cling to unilaterally enacted laws, applying\nthem to all. Old ideological barriers have been replaced\nwith new barriers, including impeding access of many\ndeveloping countries to the technology necessary for\ntheir development and advancement. Moreover, our\nworld is still not free of criminal activity, including the\nillicit trade in small weapons and narcotics and\ntransnational organized crime.\nThe United Nations is the tool of our common\nwork in our efforts to face these challenges.\nUndoubtedly it has made many efforts, but it could\ncertainly be more effective in carrying out its duties if\ndrastic structural reforms were made to its organs and\nif new working methods were developed for its various\nmechanisms. Many proposals have been submitted over\nthe past few years in this regard, but, unfortunately,\nthey did not resonate with certain Powers that care only\nfor their narrow selfish interests. This makes it\nincumbent upon the other Members of this\nOrganization that have a real stake in reform to unify\ntheir efforts and capacities to effect inevitable change,\nif we want our Organization to succeed, consistent with\nthe spirit of the times, and to meet the needs of the\npeople.\nFor our part, we wish once again to reaffirm that\nsuch change should be aimed at achieving the\nfollowing.\nFirst, it must enhance and develop cooperation\namong the principal organs of the United Nations, and\nbetween these organs and other bodies and agencies of\nthe United Nations system, with a view to resolving\ninternational problems in all their aspects.\nSecondly, it must enhance the role of the General\nAssembly, making it more effective, so that it can carry\nout the functions entrusted to it by the Charter,\nincluding contributing to the adoption of measures to\nmaintain international peace and security. The\nAssembly should have the authority to control and to\nhold accountable other United Nations organs,\nincluding the Security Council, which should be\naccountable to the Assembly.\nThirdly, it must establish a mechanism affiliated\nwith the General Assembly to follow up the\nimplementation of Assembly resolutions. We cannot\nwait indefinitely for the implementation of resolutions,\nmost of which were adopted more than 50 years ago.\nFourthly, it must accelerate the introduction of\nradical reform to the Security Council membership in\norder to apply the principle of equitable geographic\ndistribution and thus do justice to the disadvantaged\nregions in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are\nunder-represented in the Council. Reform should also\napply to improving the Council's working methods to\nensure transparency in its work and democracy in its\ndecision-making.\nFifthly, the privileges emanating from victories of\nthe Second World War must be withdrawn, the most\nimportant being the right of veto, which has become\nobsolete. Therefore, there is no longer any justification\nfor maintaining it, not only because it contravenes the\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, but also\nbecause it has been used to protect aggressors from\n11\n\ncondemnation. It is also being used to prevent the\nadoption of measures to protect those subjected to\naggression, killing, displacement and other acts of\ngenocide.\nSeeking to establish peace and enhance stability\nis among the major purposes of the United Nations.\nThis Organization certainly cannot perform all these\nfunctions alone. Member States can establish effective\nmechanisms to resolve the most intractable problems.\nIn this context, we in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have\nmade consistent efforts to assist countries suffering\nfrom conflicts and disputes. Talks held last June, under\nthe auspices of the Qadhafi Charitable Organization,\nbetween the Government of the Philippines and the\nMoro Front, led to the signature of the Tripoli Peace\nAgreement, ending a bitter conflict and meeting the\naspirations of both parties for the restoration of\nsecurity and stability in southern Philippines.\nWe have participated effectively in various\nnegotiations that have resulted in the settlement of the\nEthiopia-Eritrea dispute and the conclusion of the\nArusha Agreement, ending the conflict in Burundi.\nTogether with other African countries, we are\nintensifying our efforts to support reconciliation in\nSomalia and the restoration of peace to the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo on the basis of the Lusaka\nAgreement, emanating from the agreement signed in\nthe city of Sirte in September 1999.\nCurrently, intensive efforts are being made to\nimplement the Libyan-Egyptian initiative, in\ncoordination with the initiative of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, to\nachieve broad-based national reconciliation in the\nSudan so that its people can live in harmony and\nstability, based on the unity and territorial integrity of\nthat sisterly country and equality among its people.\nWe take great pride in our contributions and\nachievements. But above all, Libyans from all walks of\nlife  men and women  greatly cherish the historic\nevent that took place in March of this year, when\nAfrican leaders announced the establishment of the\nAfrican Union at the second Sirte summit. This was\nfollowed by the thirty-seventh summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity, held last July, which\ntook progressive practical measures to strengthen the\nfundamentals of this Union, which is an important\ntransformation in the history of Africa, realizing as it\ndid, the dream of the forefathers of a unified Africa. It\nwas the culmination of the efforts of the great African\nleaders whose objective has always been the unity of\nthe continent so that it could enhance its security and\nprogress and build its future. It is a new phase in an\nAfrican renaissance that will eliminate rifts that divide\nthe continent and will establish one bloc for all\nAfricans, capable of confronting various challenges in\na world of large groupings.\nThe fact that Africa has taken all these initiatives\nand steps sends a clear message to other countries of\nthe world that Africa fully realizes that resolving its\nproblems and developing its abilities is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Africans. Yet we must emphasize\nthat there will be no peace, security or stability in the\nworld as long as Africa suffers from problems and\ndisturbances. For that, the United Nations and all\ncountries must assist in the efforts of African countries\nto establish peace throughout the continent and to\nenhance security in all its corners. This requires\nprimarily support for Africa's dispute-settlement\nmechanisms, assistance in eradicating the poverty of\nmillions of its people and the elimination of diseases,\nparticularly HIV/AIDS, which threatens the lives of\nmore than 30 million Africans.\nMoreover, a solution must be found to the\nproblem of external debt, which devours most of\nAfrica's earnings. Moreover, an end must be put to\nconsequences of colonialism, the cause of Africa's\nunderdevelopment and the obstacle to its progress. The\nonly way to do justice to the peoples of Africa is for\nthose States that conquered their land, looted the\ncontinent's resources and built their progress at its\nexpense to apologize to the peoples of Africa for these\npractices and to pay them full compensation for the\nlosses and damages caused by colonialism.\nThe international community has thus far failed\nto resolve the Palestinian problem, which is almost as\nold as the United Nations itself. This is essentially due\nto disregard of the core of the problem, which is that a\nland was usurped and its people were expelled from\ntheir homeland. Thus, Palestine remained occupied.\nMost of its people became refugees in various parts of\nthe world, and those who stayed were made into\nprisoners in their own homes, deprived of the most\nbasic human rights. The Palestinian people are being\nsubjected to the most heinous crimes committed\nagainst any people in contemporary history. Palestinian\nchildren and young and elderly people are assassinated,\ntheir land is confiscated, their farms are burnt and their\n12\n\nhouses are demolished to be replaced by houses of\nsettlers who came from various parts of the world in\npursuit of unbelievable and illogical myths.\nOld and new developments of the Palestinian\nquestion are sufficient proof that ending the suffering\nof the Palestinians under occupation cannot be\nachieved through plans that are never implemented. It\nhas also been cogently proven that the problem will not\nbe resolved by the resolutions that the United Nations\nhas been reiterating for more than five decades.\nIn the light of those irrefutable facts, the solution\nthat should be sought, and on which all efforts must\nfocus, lies in what my country has said before and\nreaffirms now: the Palestinian people must return to\ntheir homeland, from which they were expelled, and a\ndemocratic, non-racist State must be established in\nwhich all citizens are equal irrespective of religion or\nethnicity, a State similar to the one that has been\nestablished in the Republic of South Africa. Any other\nsolution would be a fantasy that would serve only to\nperpetuate the Palestinian tragedy.\nSpeaking of the situation in the eastern Arab\nregion, my country reaffirms its unlimited support for\nsisterly Syria and Lebanon in their steadfastness in the\nface of Israeli aggression. We condemn all attempts to\nprovoke those countries, and we uphold their right to\nrecover all their territories under occupation.\nTurning to the current situation in Iraq, we\ncondemn the daily violations of Iraqi sovereignty and\nthe continuous aggression to which Iraq is subjected.\nWe call on all peace-loving countries to work towards\nthe lifting of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people\nand towards putting an end to all schemes aimed at\ndestroying their capacities and at dividing their land.\nTireless efforts have been made in the field of\ndisarmament. My country is a party to most\ninternational disarmament agreements and is in the\nprocess of acceding to the remaining ones, including\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\nand on Their Destruction and the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. But we firmly believe that\ngeneral and complete disarmament cannot come about\nwithout a change in current norms and in the approach\nto disarmament issues. What we see today is a growing\ntrend towards the control of small arms and light\nweapons rather than of the weapons of mass\ndestruction that pose a greater threat to international\npeace and security and to human life.\nThat is why we wonder about the sharp focus on\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\nMines and on Their Destruction, even though it\naddresses only simple, limited weapons that small and\nweak countries need to defend their borders against\npowerful countries that possess aircraft carriers and\naeroplanes that can be refueled in the air. Why should\nwe not focus our efforts on the destruction of chemical\nand biological weapons and of ballistic missiles? Why\nare nuclear-weapon States not serious about practical\nmeasures to destroy their nuclear stockpiles? Why are\ncertain countries falsely accused of acquiring weapons\nof mass destruction while there is silence about the\nIsraelis, who, as everybody knows, possess hundreds of\nnuclear warheads and other weapons of mass\ndestruction and conventional weapons? Moreover, Israel\ncontinues to defy the will of the international\ncommunity, which has called on it to accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand to place its nuclear facilities under the safeguards\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency in order to\nhelp ensure that the region is free of nuclear weapons.\nWe want the important question of disarmament\nto be dealt with in a comprehensive and non-selective\nmanner. Efforts should be concentrated first and\nforemost on the adoption of practical measures to\ndestroy nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.\nThat should apply to all those that possess such\nweapons without exception; they should cease insisting\non the development of new defensive systems that\ncould threaten the world's strategic stability and trigger\na new arms race. Unless the matter is addressed in that\nway, disarmament efforts will be meaningless; they\nwill remain a great fraud perpetrated on all the peoples\nof the world.\nDuring the past nine sessions of the General\nAssembly, we have reviewed developments in the\ndispute between my country and a number of Western\ncountries over the United States aeroplane that crashed\nover Lockerbie. During the past two sessions, we have\nfocused on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's cooperation\nwith the Scottish court that has been meeting in the\nNetherlands since the two Libyan suspects decided\nvoluntarily to appear before it. On each occasion, we\nhave reiterated our request that the Security Council\nlift the sanctions it imposed on the Libyan people,\n13\n\nbecause Libya has fully responded to the requirements\nof Council resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992) and\n1192 (1998). That was confirmed by the report of the\nSecretary-General to the Security Council, submitted in\nconformity with paragraph 16 of Security Council\nresolution 883 (1993).\nWe are obliged once again to broach this\nquestion, and for a valid reason: the developments of\nearlier this year. As members know, on 3 May 2000 the\nScottish court began its trial of the two Libyans\nsuspected of being linked to the Pan Am aircraft\nincident. During the trial it became very clear that the\njudges were not convinced of the truth of testimony\nfrom the three witnesses offered by the other party as\nwitnesses for the prosecution. The court concluded that\nthe principal witness in the case, Mr. Abdul Majid\nGiaka, was lying, as were Tony Gauci and Edwin\nBollier. In paragraph 45 of its opinion, the court stated:\nWe have assessed carefully the evidence of\nthese three witnesses ... relating to the MST-13\ntimers .... All three, and notably Mr. Bollier, were\nshown to be unreliable witnesses. [Their various\nstatements were] at times in conflict with each\nother ... On some occasions, particularly in the\ncase of Mr. Bollier, their evidence was self-\ncontradictory.\nIt was thus fully expected that the Scottish court\nwould acquit both suspects for lack of evidence. But\nthe decision of 31 January 2001 ran counter to those\nexpectations. The court convicted one of the suspects,\nMr. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, and acquitted\nthe second, Mr. Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah. That\njudgement came as a surprise to all political analysts\nand jurists, for whom it raised many questions,\nincluding why one of the suspects was convicted when\nthe two principal prosecution witnesses were proven to\nhave lied and when the court found the third unreliable.\nHow could the court's decision to convict one man and\nacquit the other be explained, since they were both\nsuspected on the basis of the same assumptions?\nThe only answer to those questions is that, at the\nlast moment, the court departed from applying the law\nand instead took a political decision. The first to\nindicate this was Robert Black, an architect of the\nLockerbie court, who said that the elements of the case\nagainst Al Megrahi were very weak. And Hans\nK\u02c6chler, a university professor appointed by the\nSecretary-General as an international observer of the\ntrial, issued a report dated 3 February 2001, which\nincluded many comments, including the following.\n[The Opinion] is totally incomprehensible for\nany rational observer when one considers that the\nindictment in its very essence was based on the\njoint action of the two accused in Malta.\nThe Opinion of the Court is exclusively\nbased on circumstantial evidence and on a series\nof highly problematic inferences. As to the\nundersigned's knowledge, there is not one single\npiece of material evidence linking the two\naccused to the crime. In such a context, the guilty\nverdict in regard to the first accused appears to be\narbitrary, even irrational.\n...\nThis leads ... to the suspicion that political\nconsiderations may have been overriding a\nstrictly judicial evaluation of the case.\nIn placing these facts before the United Nations\nmembership, we want to stress that the conviction\nhanded down by the court on 31 January 2001 was a\npolitical decision that had nothing to do with the law.\nThe Libyan citizen Mr. Al Megrahi was kidnapped for\npolitical reasons, as confirmed in resolutions and\nstatements adopted by a number of regional\norganizations, including at the Lusaka summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity, the twenty-eighth\nministerial session of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference held at Bamako, and the meeting of\nForeign Ministers of the League of Arab States held at\nCairo earlier this year.\nOur gratitude goes to the members of those\norganizations and to others that have shown solidarity\nwith us from the outset for standing on the side of\nright. We call on all Members of the United Nations\nthat support right and justice to take the necessary\naction to meet the demands of those organizations. The\nfirst is the immediate release of Mr. Al Megrahi, who\nwas convicted for political reasons that have nothing to\ndo with the law. His continued detention amounts to\nhostage-taking under all relevant laws and customs.\nThe second element of those demands is\ncategorical rejection of the stubborn blockage of the\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on Libya, which\nignores the provisions of paragraph 16 of Security\nCouncil 883 (1993) and the findings of the report of the\nSecretary-General in that regard. The Security Council\n14\n\nshould immediately, totally and permanently lift the\nsanctions imposed on Libya, in view of the fact that\nLibya has met all the requirements of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, including resolution 1192\n(1998). The third element is support for the legitimate\nright of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to receive fair\ncompensation for the material and human losses it has\nincurred as a result of the sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI address this General Assembly grief-\nstricken at the death of 260 people in the tragic\naviation accident yesterday in this city of New York.\nMost of the individuals stricken were, like myself, of\nDominican nationality. Our profound appreciation goes\nto the heads of State and Government, to Ministers and\nto representatives who have expressed their\ncondolences to the people and Government of the\nDominican Republic at this tragedy. I am much obliged\nto you, Sir.\nOn behalf of the Government of the Dominican\nRepublic I offer our congratulations to the President on\nhis election to the stewardship of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, convinced as we are that he will\nindeed succeed in guiding this session in the very best\ninterests, and for the good, of the international\ncommunity. Likewise, we offer our most heartfelt\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his having been awarded the Nobel Peace\nPrize. That honour, together with that bestowed upon\nthe United Nations, proves and ratifies the confidence\nand recognition felt for the work being done by the\ninternational community represented in this\nOrganization on behalf of all mankind.\nDespite the fact that in September this year \u2014 on\nthe heels of the events of 11 September in New York\nand in Washington, D.C. \u2014 the United Nations devoted\n11\n\na number of plenary meetings to the issue of terrorism,\nit is still today impossible for us to separate this from\nthe other items that we must deal with on the agenda of\nthis session. The significance of these tragic\ndevelopments is of such magnitude that it is imperative\nfor us, as a matter of conscience, to stop and think in\ngreater depth about their complexity and their\nrepercussions on the history that it is our lot to have to\nlive through, and about the most relevant ways for us\nto prevent and combat this scourge. That is so because\nit is plain to see that in the time that has elapsed\nbetween September and these days of November, we\nhave managed to go further and into greater depth,\ngaining new insights about the terrorist phenomenon.\nWe absolutely agree with those who have already\nspoken that terrorism cannot be justified in any way,\nand that the excuses some would seek to advance to\nvalidate these deeds based on the existence of certain\neconomic, social, cultural or political situations, are\nunacceptable. However paradoxical it may seem to\nsome, the conviction has also been stressed that, while\nterrorism is unjustifiable and inexcusable, it is in those\nvery situations where terrorism finds its breeding\ngrounds, where frustrations and lack of prospects can\nfan hatred and irrationality, where being shut out and\nhaving no hope, being shunted to the sidelines and\nsuffering from poverty can incubate and give birth and\nimpetus to twisted feelings of indiscriminate and\nirrational vengeance.\nFaced with the sad reality of the events of 11\nSeptember just past, we are absolutely convinced that\nthe direction set for us by the Millennium Summit was\nthe right one, that is, the path of peace and of\nfellowship among people. At that historic gathering the\nrationale was analysed and the framework set for\naction by the international community to promote\nhuman rights, security, disarmament, economic\ndevelopment, equality of nations, and the fight against\nhunger, poverty, disease, exclusion, social, racial and\ngender prejudice, and the abandonment of children, the\ndisabled and the elderly. There can be no doubt that\nthese are the priority objectives for the prevention of\nviolence and crime, that is to say, for the struggle\nagainst wars, against genocide and against terrorism.\nThe full weight, pain and inhumanity of the\nprovocations of 11 September must not divert us from\nthe goals that we set for ourselves in the Millennium\nSummit Declaration, nor draw us into any\ndisproportionate violence. When last month we\naddressed this Assembly we stated that the most prized\nvirtue, indeed the democratic essence of this\nOrganization, that is of the United Nations, is its\ncommitment and determination to uphold respect for\nhuman rights. It follows that although we know that\nterrorism is the antithesis of that virtue, we must not\ntherefore act to confront it while failing to live up to\nthe obligation to protect those very rights. While acting\nin a legitimate reaction of self-defence, we should not\nbe overcome by a spirit of retaliation but should rather\nseek to apply international law and justice. That is why\nthe Dominican Republic cannot ignore the political\nmeasures that surely will also contribute to preventing\nand combating terrorism. Thus, we must resolutely\nsupport Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\nadopted on 28 September, and feel ourselves also\nbound by earlier resolutions and covenants the United\nNations has worked out over time in its fight against\nterrorism.\nIn 1945 the United Nations Charter highlighted as\nits core concern the need to preserve peace. That was\nonly to be expected after a war that had brought death\nto millions of human beings and had wreaked havoc in\nthe life of many nations. The time that has elapsed has\nbrought us to the conviction that there is no better way\nto preserve peace than to do all that we possibly can to\nprevent war. The United Nations is ever more\nnecessary to attain that end, because within it we find\nthe underpinnings for promoting a healthy and creative\nunderstanding among nations. Our fidelity to the\nfoundations of the Organization must be backed up by\na shared political will leading to actions that prove\nirrefutably that we believe in and live up to what we\nsay and promise.\nThe unanimous adoption of the Millennium\nDeclaration, inasmuch as it represented a profound\ncommitment by the vast majority of the world\u2019s\nleaders, amounted to a kind of rebirth and renewal of\nthe United Nations in coming to grips with the\nproblems and challenges confronting us in the twenty-\nfirst century. In that Declaration it was decided to do\nall that we could to establish a just and lasting peace in\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter, and the determination was\nreaffirmed to support all efforts aimed at ensuring the\nsovereign equality of States, respect for their territorial\nintegrity and political independence and the right to\nself-determination of peoples that remain under\ncolonial domination and foreign occupation.\n12\n\nThat pledge makes it incumbent upon us to bring\nour full moral force to bear and to avail ourselves of all\npossibilities afforded us by the machinery of the\nOrganization to resolve the conflicts that keep a\nnumber of States around the globe in a state of war. We\nhave no doubt whatever that the conflict between Israel\nand the Palestinian state must come to an end via\ncompliance with the multiple resolutions towards that\nend that have emanated from the General Assembly,\nthus honouring what we agreed upon in that\nMillennium Declaration.\nMoreover, we set for ourselves the purpose of\nspurring forward reform of the United Nations Charter\nand respecting the equality of the rights of nations.\nRatifying the Millennium Declaration means that there\ncan be no delay in turning the Security Council into a\nbody that would respond to the historic realities of the\npresent world and in establishing a logical set of\ndemocratic balances based on those realities. It seems\nto us fair for the non-permanent members to participate\nin the Security Council via a rotational system that\nwould give to all the same opportunity. By the same\ntoken, the Dominican Republic believes that it is also a\nmatter of equity and historical realism for us to accept\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan as a Member of the\nUnited Nations. Geopolitical reasons must not override\nsituations of fact that have been recognized in bringing\nother States into the United Nations.\nIn the Millennium Declaration the problem of\nglobalization was addressed with the following words:\n\u201cWe recognize that developing countries\nand countries with economies in transition face\nspecial difficulties in responding to this central\nchallenge. Thus, only through broad and\nsustained efforts to create a shared future, based\nupon our common humanity in all its diversity,\ncan globalization be made fully inclusive and\nequitable.\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 5)\nAs we speak, a Ministerial Meeting of the countries\nmembers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is\nbeing held in Doha, Qatar. Most countries with small\neconomies are rightfully calling for the fulfilment of all\nthe agreements of the Uruguay Round. We hope that\nthey will not be saddled with unbearable new burdens,\nthat their calls will be heard and that generous\nsolidarity and cooperation will be shown, as well as\nunderstanding of the imbalances, differences and\nasymmetries in the pace of development when\ncomparing rich countries to poor, small ones.\nAmong the objectives of the World Trade\nOrganization are respect for human rights,\nstrengthening democracy and preserving the\nenvironment. All that will not be possible if the process\nof globalization is not carried out with a sincere and\nresolute determination to show understanding and to\nprovide cooperation and technical assistance to help\nthe majority of the nations on this planet to achieve\ndevelopment. How are we to understand the deadlines\nset by the World Trade Organization for attaining\ncertain economic objectives, in some cases as soon as\n2003 and in others 2005, when the Millennium\nDeclaration, aware of the inequalities and difficulties\nfacing most nations, seeks to redress no sooner than\n2015 \u2014 and only to a certain degree \u2014 the poverty of\nmillions upon millions of human beings whose income\nis less than $1 a day? We hope that at the conferences\nscheduled by the United Nations, such as the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, light can be shed on these problems in\nan effective way, yielding equitable measures designed\nto reduce the inequalities separating peoples one from\nthe other.\nAllow me finally to refer to an aspect most\nintimately tied to respect for and recognition of human\nrights, something that also coincides with the\nMillennium Declaration inasmuch as it refers to the\ndemands of women and gender equality. Indeed, the\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the\nAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW), based in the\nDominican Republic, is one of the few United Nations\ninstitutions located in a developing country, and the\nonly international institute devoted to research on and\ntraining for the advancement of women. The Secretary-\nGeneral, in his report to the General Assembly\npresented in the Third Committee on 17 October 2001,\nsaid that, notwithstanding the difficulties and\nuncertainties that INSTRAW has encountered in the\nlast two years it has managed to obtain the minimum\nresources for fulfilling the mandate assigned to it by\nthe Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.\nHe went on to say that inasmuch as the Institute\nhas begun to produce tangible results via the\ninformation system and contact networks in creating an\nawareness of gender issues, perhaps the Assembly\nwould wish to adopt a decision on how Institute would\n13\n\nbe able to operate productively and cost-effectively\nbeyond the year 2001.\nLet us not let INSTRAW \u2014 that noble institution,\na pioneer in the advancement of women, particularly of\nwomen in developing countries \u2014 perish for lack of\nresources. Let us make a consistent and generous\ngesture, demonstrating solidarity, so that the General\nAssembly will ensure the continued existence of this\ninstitution beyond this year of 2001, by allocating in\nthe United Nations budget the funds necessary for it to\ncontinue to work towards its fruitful humanitarian\nends.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to\nexpress my sincere congratulations to the President on\nhis election to lead the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am fully confident that under his\npresidency, we will have productive discussions and\nreach a fruitful conclusion. I would also like to convey\nmy appreciation to the outgoing President for his\nconduct of the work of the last session.\nLet me also take this opportunity to once again\nconvey my Government\u2019s warmest congratulations to\nour Secretary-General on his appointment to lead our\nOrganization for a second term. Indeed, his re-election\nis well deserved. We are also delighted that the United\nNations and the Secretary-General were awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize for this year. It is a testimony to and\na recognition of the important work the United Nations\nhas been doing.\nIt is now over two months since the terrible\nevents of 11 September. What happened on that day\ntouched not only the people of the United States but\nalso the whole world. Not only because scores of\ncountries lost nationals, but also because New York,\nthe seat of the United Nations, is in many ways the\ncapital of the world. The terrorists might have\nsucceeded in committing this unimaginable and\nbarbaric crime, but we have no doubt that they have\nfailed to extinguish the hope and vitality that New York\nsymbolizes and embodies.\nTerrorism is not new to Ethiopia. For the past 10\nyears, we have been victims of terrorist attacks, and we\nhave combated it. That is why we remain committed to\ndoing our utmost to enhance the international effort to\nroot out terrorism.\n23\n\nOver the long term, terrorism will be defeated\nwhen the ideological cover it is wearing is removed\nand shown to be empty. But this can be achieved only\nwhen those who are capable of perpetrating heinous\ncrimes are not only denied safe havens, but also\ndeprived of any alibi. This is where, among other\nthings, the fight against poverty becomes all the more\ncritical.\nThe fight against poverty is not as elusive as the\nfight against terrorism. For the former, we know the\ncauses, and we know how to fight it and which tools to\nuse. What we lack is the global political will to act.\nThe grimness of conditions in Africa in this regard is\nobvious. There is no need for me to go into detail\nregarding the statistics on the situation in Africa.\nAfrican leaders have taken the conclusions of the\nMillennium Assembly a step further and have come up\nwith the New African Initiative, now called the New\nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD). They\nhave drawn a broad plan on how to bring peace,\nsecurity and development to a continent that has been\nplagued by conflict, overwhelmed with insecurity and\nmired in underdevelopment. The main thrust of the\ninitiative is that we in Africa have duly acknowledged\nthe responsibility for our continent\u2019s fate. Hence, we\nfully accept that peace, security, democracy, good\ngovernance and sound economic management are\nessential conditions for economic growth and\nsustainable development. At the same time, we are\nfully aware that Africa at present lacks the required\nresources and capacity to implement this initiative.\nThis new African initiative thus calls for a\ncomplementary obligation on the part of the\ninternational community.\nI would like to point out the importance of this\nmutual obligation. Without it, we cannot look forward\nto the future with confidence; without it, the\nconsequences are bound to be grave. This is the\nchallenge that we face in Africa. The international\ncommunity must confront it with renewed vigour and\ndedication.\nOn the subject of our national effort to seize the\nopportunity presented by the prevailing peace in my\ncountry, I have the pleasure to inform the Assembly\nthat we are now back on track in terms of playing our\nproper role for peace and investing all our energy and\nresources in fighting poverty at the national level. This\nis a war, and we count on our partners to stand with us\nin waging it. Our strategy in fighting poverty touches\non everything we do \u2014 in politics, diplomacy and the\neconomic domain.\nWe want to succeed in the fight against the HIV/\nAIDS pandemic affecting our country. This major\nscourge must be defeated. We are determined to fight\nagainst corruption, and our record is unambiguous in\nthis area. We are committed to pursuing this without\nany let-up.\nI would now like to turn to the political and\nsecurity situation in our subregion, which, for obvious\nreasons, is critical for us, as it should be a source of\nconcern for the international community.\nThe problem in Somalia needs to be resolved as\nspeedily as possible. There is no reason why the\nsituation should be allowed to continue festering, to the\ndetriment of the people of Somalia and of the\nsubregion in general. The parties to the conflict have to\nsit down without preconditions to establish a broad-\nbased Government. That is what was called for by the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development at the\nmeeting at the summit level in November 2000. This\nhas to be implemented. This is the most viable\nalternative. To do less would amount to abandoning\nSomalia for international terrorists to wreak havoc\nthere and in the subregion. The establishment of a\nbroad-based Government in Somalia that includes all\nthe major political forces in the country is a crucial\nstep towards peace-making in Somalia, for which there\nis no substitute. Ethiopia intends, along with other\nmembers of the IGAD subcommittee on Somalia, to\nplay a more proactive role for the realization of this\nobjective.\nWe are also prepared to do our level best to assist\nin the process of national reconciliation in Sudan. We\nplan to be more active in this undertaking as well. We\nbelieve that to bring the peace process forward, the will\nand determination of the parties is critical. But they\nneed to be assisted, and assist we will, in good faith\nand with all the necessary responsibility.\nWith regard to the situation between Ethiopia and\nEritrea and the implementation of the Algiers Peace\nAgreement, it is neither prudent nor proper for me to\nconceal from the international community both our\ndisappointment and, more importantly, our growing\nconcern. But let me, right from the outset, lest I be\nmisunderstood, make one important point absolutely\nclear. Ethiopia is committed to the peace process and to\n24\n\nthe scrupulous implementation of the Algiers\nAgreement. This is how we intend to continue in the\nfuture. We want the United Nations Mission in\nEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to succeed.\nHowever, success in this or in any other conflict\nsituation cannot be achieved by the efforts of one of the\nparties alone. This describes the situation we are facing\nin the peace process between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nPrudence dictates that we call a spade a spade. Eritrea\nis not complying with the Algiers Agreement, an\nagreement which we believe is fair and in the interest\nof both parties to protect.\nThe Temporary Security Zone established by the\nAlgiers Agreement is required to be a demilitarized\nzone separating the two forces. This is the most critical\nprovision of the Algiers Agreement, whose violation\nwould logically unravel the whole peace process.\nEritrea has continued to refuse to maintain the integrity\nof the Temporary Security Zone as a demilitarized\nbuffer area between the two forces. Regrettably, this\nviolation is taking place under UNMEE\u2019s nose. We\nhave continued to complain, but in vain.\nUNMEE might have felt that Eritrea\u2019s compliance\nwould eventually be secured through appeasement and\nby ignoring Ethiopia\u2019s legitimate concern. But our\nexperience has made it unmistakably clear that\nappeasement has never worked with Eritrea. And it is\nnot working now. What we have started witnessing\nlately is an ever-increasing mobilization of troops by\nEritrea along the common border. Under these\ncircumstances, lack of vigilance on the part of UNMEE\nand its policy of appeasement appears to be making\nanother round of fighting close to inevitable. The\nEritrean authorities might have felt that tension along\nthe common border is useful in the light of domestic\npolitical necessities. It might serve a purpose for\ndiverting popular attention from the domestic front, but\nit is manifestly reckless and dangerous. Under the\ncircumstances, we call on the United Nations, as a co-\nguarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement, to shoulder\nits full responsibility to ensure that the Agreement is\nscrupulously followed. The Security Council should\nsend an unambiguous message to Eritrea to\nimmediately desist from all actions that endanger the\npeace process.\nUNMEE needs to wake up and take Ethiopia\u2019s\nreal concern seriously. Let there be no doubt about\nEthiopia\u2019s continuing commitment to the scrupulous\nobservance of the Algiers Agreement and to the peace\nprocess. Ethiopia will continue to do this faithfully.\nEthiopia is also equally determined to respond to real\nthreats, and reserves its right to act in self-defence.\nThere should be no doubt about Ethiopia\u2019s\ncommitment to peace and stability and to carrying out\nits responsibilities to the best of its abilities on matters\nthat affect the international community as a whole \u2500\nfirst of all in its own subregion and in Africa. Its\ncommitment to the United Nations endures. Ethiopia is\na country that has always been true to principles of\ninternational law and to their scrupulous observance.\nWe are proud of this tradition and we cherish it. This is\na tradition we will continue to be guided by.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis meeting is being held at\na most difficult hour. The terrorist attacks carried out in\nNew York and Washington, D.C., cast a long shadow\nover this session of the General Assembly. But we must\nstand united, drawing the right conclusions from this\ncatastrophe. The date of 11 September has made it\nclear that terrorism is now humankind\u2019s number-one\nenemy, and that it must be addressed with the utmost\nseriousness and determination.\nWe share the American nation\u2019s grief. We\nreiterate our full support to the United States\nAdministration in its efforts to track down those\nresponsible and to bring them to justice. As a country\nthat has lost so many of its citizens to terrorism,\nTurkey deeply feels the grief of this tragic event.\nTo combat terrorism efficiently and to develop a\nstrong coalition of United Nations Members against\nterrorism, certain principles should guide our collective\neffort. First, terrorism does not have a religion or a\ngeography, and there can be no justification for\nterrorist acts under any circumstances. Secondly, the\nuse of double standards is the main obstacle to the fight\nagainst terrorism. Thirdly, we have to be conscious of\nthe fact that terrorism is a global phenomenon.\nNo ideal, no cause and no end can justify\nterrorism. We should avoid spurious justifications for\ndeliberate killing. To identify terrorism with any\nreligion is a sacrilege against all religions. We strongly\ncondemn those who couple the name of a religion with\na definition of terrorism or terrorists. To fight this\ndangerous trend, we fully support all initiatives aimed\nat dispelling these erroneous approaches.\nWe commend the ongoing mutual efforts of the\nUnited Nations, as well as several other initiatives. In\nthis context, Turkey has proposed an informal forum\nbetween members of, and aspirants to, the European\nUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\n(OIC) to discuss, from a political perspective, issues\npertaining to harmony among civilizations. We have\nthe initial support of the relevant organizations and of\nseveral countries. We hope to hold this conference by\nFebruary 2002.\n9\n\nTerrorism does not have a geography. The same\nterrorism manifests itself in different countries all over\nthe world, both in the West and in the East. To be\nserious and effective, the anti-terrorist struggle has to\nbe all-encompassing and deal with all terrorist centres,\nactivities and logistics. It should address all countries\nthat harbour and tolerate terrorism or that are\nindifferent to terrorist groups that incite or actively\nplan, finance or command terrorist operations executed\nin another country.\nBeing drawn into the trap of double standards in\ndefining or in dealing with terrorism inherently\nprovides support for terrorism. Unfortunately, we have\nbeen witnessing several cases of double standards. I\nwill try to give some views on this particular subject.\nThere is an unfortunate de facto distinction made\nin the conceptual approaches of several countries\nbetween \u201cbad\u201d terrorists, who work against a particular\ncountry, and tolerated terrorists, who, while enjoying\nsafe haven in the same country, incite, plan, finance\nand sometimes command terrorist acts in another. My\ncountry, as well as several others, has been victim of\nthis double-standard approach. Groups implanted in\nforeign countries openly advocate the use of terrorist\nmeans under all sorts of pretexts. Their activities and\nmessages \u2014 which call for violence, and sometimes\nfor assassination \u2014 are freely propagated and are\nsometimes transmitted through the authorized media in\ntheir host countries. In short, acts and calls that would\ndraw an immediate reaction if they were the acts and\ncalls of indigenous terrorists targeting their own\ncountry are ignored and tolerated when they emanate\nfrom guest terrorists targeting their country of origin.\nThis unfortunate distinction between terrorists that hurt\nothers but not us and the prevailing double standards\nhave to be overcome if we are serious about fighting\nterrorists.\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that crosses\nborders, and the fight against it requires effective\ninternational cooperation. Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001) in particular provides a clear road map\nregarding the steps to be taken. We hope that all\nMember States will fully comply with this\ngroundbreaking resolution. The establishment of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) is a major\ndevelopment.\nWe welcome the joint declarations of 14 and 21\nSeptember 2001 by the European Union. Turkey\naligned itself with both, and we expect their prompt\nand resolute implementation. The European Union is in\nthe process of identifying terrorist organizations and\ntheir support networks. The list of terrorist\norganizations to be drawn up by the European Union\nmust not be restricted only to the geographical area of\nits members. It should definitely include those groups\nthat finance, plan and command terrorist activities in\nother countries.\nThere is a drastic need for vigilance and further\ncooperation between the relevant authorities, namely,\nthe justice and interior ministries of all countries. A\ndrastic change in attitude is imperative.\nIn order for it to be credible and effective, the\nanti-terror struggle has to be comprehensive and deal\nwith all terrorist centres. It is also incumbent upon all\nUnited Nations Member States to adopt the existing\ninternational legislation and to review national laws\naccordingly. International efforts to combat terrorism\ncannot be fully effective in the absence of a global\nconvention in this field.\nThe draft comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism now under discussion in the\nworking group established by the Sixth Committee\nseems to be our best chance to address this\nshortcoming. Although all participants have displayed\nremarkable flexibility, the working group has failed to\nresolve two central and interrelated issues: the\ndefinition of a terrorist offence and exclusions from the\nscope of the convention. I wish to take this opportunity\nto call upon all States to make an additional effort\ntowards finalizing the convention.\nIn combating terrorism, we cannot ignore the fact\nthat this scourge feeds on deteriorating social,\neconomic and political conditions. Illiteracy,\ndestitution, bigotry, racism, social and political\ninjustice and similar sources of grievance all play a\nrole in creating fertile ground for terrorism. The gap\nbetween the richest and the least fortunate nations of\nthe world keeps widening at an alarming pace. Threats\nsuch as illegal mass migration, corruption, drugs and\narms smuggling, money laundering and other types of\norganized crime are on the increase.\nIt is our collective responsibility to find lasting,\nviable solutions to these problems. Developing nations\nmust focus on ways of achieving sustainable economic\n10\n\ngrowth, on improving income distribution, education\nand justice and on addressing other social needs.\nDeveloped nations must be more forthcoming in debt\nrelief, must increase development and humanitarian aid\nand must allow greater access to their markets.\nToday, the United Nations and its Member States\nface a mutual challenge. The name of this challenge is\nAfghanistan, and it has two dimensions: to combat the\nterrorist network, which, by exploiting the Afghan\npeople\u2019s plight, has taken root in its geography; and to\nsupport the revival of Afghanistan, of the Afghan\nidentity, by ensuring peace, stability and economic\ndevelopment.\nTurkey is resolutely committed to meet this\nchallenge; we fully support the United Nations efforts\nand those of the Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi.\nTurkey worked together with the Afghan people from\nthe 1920s to the 1960s; and it resumed cooperation\nagain in the early 1990s. We believe that concerted\ninternational action, with sound principles and\neffective means, is of crucial importance. I will try to\nelaborate on some suggestions.\nFirst, it is the Afghan people themselves who will\nrebuild their identity and their country. Our task is to\nassist and support their efforts \u2014 not to dictate who\nwill run their country, and how. In this respect, regional\nand tribal affinities should be encouraged to merge into\na single Afghan identity and assume a secondary role\nas sub-cultures. This is capital for Afghanistan.\nSecondly, all countries, either neighbours of or\ninvolved in Afghanistan, should be discouraged from\nrelying on particular Afghan groups as their primary\nallies and should refrain from pursuing their special\ninterests through those groups.\nThirdly, while the fight against terrorism and its\nsupporters goes on, special care must be taken to\nensure that innocent civilians are kept out of harm\u2019s\nway. All humanitarian support should be provided,\norganized and facilitated.\nFourthly, in regions and cities of Afghanistan\nfreed from terrorist oppression, the United Nations and\ninvolved forces should act immediately to ensure\nsecurity and relief. The success in providing for basic\nneeds and displaying the ability to produce a better\nfuture will be paramount in expanding positive changes\nto other parts of the country. Setting a successful\nprecedent would serve as the best catalyst.\nFifthly, and finally, everyone seems to agree that\nthe future administration and Government of\nAfghanistan should reflect all ethnicities. It should also\nencompass all political trends that have not resorted to\nterrorism. In this process, overemphasizing or\nundermining the role of any group in the country would\nbe counterproductive. It is evident that in the process\nof rebuilding Afghanistan, the United Nations has to\nplay a leading role. It is the duty of each and every\nMember State of the Organization to contribute to this\ngigantic task.\nI will touch upon one more issue, and the rest will\nbe distributed in the paper that I have prepared. This\nlast issue is: Cyprus. The Cyprus issue has remained\nfor 38 years. This subject is one that is known to the\nUnited Nations. As the dates for some radical changes\nin Cyprus through the Greek Cypriot side\u2019s unilateral\naccession to the European Union seem to be suggested,\nand as Turkey considers these changes potentially\ndangerous for the two parties and for the whole region,\nthis issue needs further attention. Any artificially\nimposed solution that is not mutually acceptable to\nboth nations in the island and to the guarantor countries\nis bound to create a severe crisis. Turkey, as well as the\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), aspire\nto a mutually acceptable solution, sought through all\npossible means.\nA unilateral act by the Greek Cypriots, in\nviolation of the 1959-1960 system, and pretending to\nrepresent both nations, contradicts the legal framework\nand the realities of Cyprus. The legal and practical\nrealities do not permit any party in the island to decide\nunilaterally to enter any international body of which\nboth Turkey and Greece are not members; and any such\ndecision has to be taken mutually by the two co-\nfounders.\nThrough formal decisions of their parliaments\nand Governments, both Turkey and the TRNC have\ndeclared that they will not accept any solution that is\nnot freely negotiated and mutually accepted. Both\nTurkey and the TRNC have also made it clear that they\nreject any such development, which would make the\nTurkish Cypriots a minority under Greek Cypriot rule.\nThe Turkish Government will not allow the resurgence\nof a situation that in 1964 and 1974 caused massive\ncrimes to be committed against the Turkish Cypriots.\nTurkey and the TRNC are for a solution based on\nthe realities of the island. There are two distinct nations\n11\n\nwith different religions, languages and cultures with\ntwo separate States and democracies in Cyprus. The\nconfederation proposal of President Denkta\u015f deserves\nserious consideration. We also support the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s Mission of Good Offices and his efforts to\nstart a new phase of talks. In order to succeed, this\ninitiative should depart from sufficient common\nground.\nTurkey welcomes the recent proposal of President\nDenkta\u015f to his Greek Cypriot counterpart that they get\ntogether informally, without any preconditions, and\ndiscuss all relevant issues in order to find a way\nforward. The refusal of the Greek Cypriot party is in no\none\u2019s interest.\nThe tragedy of 11 September can be viewed as an\nomen of what can happen if the slightest carelessness is\nshown towards any of the old and new threats the\nworld faces in the modern age, be they terrorism,\nenvironment or poverty.\nAll I have said points to the need for the strong\ncommitment of Member countries to efforts aimed at\nthe shaping of a better future. I point as well to the\nneed to strengthen and streamline the United Nations,\nwith all its principal organs. This General Assembly\nsession of 2001 is a meaningful link in the chain which\nthe international community has forged to meet the\ngrowing challenges of the new century. With realism\nand courage we shall succeed.\n\n\n\n"

We take great\nsatisfaction in his re-election to another term,\nespecially in this critical period.\nWords cannot describe the horror of my people at\nthe tragic event which unfolded here in New York, in\nWashington and other locations in September \u2014 and\nthe one yesterday. On behalf of my people, please\nallow me to reiterate our deepest and most sincere\ncondolences to the Government of the United States\nand to the victims and their families from all over the\nworld. Our resolve to combat international terrorism is\nunwavering. My country will stand ready to assist in\nany way it can in order to help bring those responsible\nfor these heinous acts to justice and to ease the\nsuffering of those affected by their actions.\nThe recently completed special debate on\nterrorism by this body makes it clear that we are all\nbrothers in this fight, with a shared determination to do\nwhat it takes to eradicate this blight on civilization.\nBut, despite the great sadness in all our hearts over the\nrecent and ongoing events, the regular work of this\nbody cannot be derailed. Part of winning this battle is\nto demonstrate the commitment and capacity of this\nbody to carry on with the great work of the Charter and\non all sides.\nThus, in addition to other actions that are being\ntaken to confront the current crisis, I call upon all\nMember States to ratify and bring into force as soon as\npossible the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was\nadopted by a resolution of the General Assembly on 9\nDecember 1999. I signed this important Convention\nyesterday on behalf of the Federated States of\nMicronesia, and I anticipate its prompt ratification by\nour Congress.\n2\n\nI take pleasure in saying that this year marks the\ntenth anniversary of the Federated States of\nMicronesia\u2019s membership in the United Nations. In\nthose 10 years, my nation and the world at large have\nundergone unprecedented change. With the assistance\nof the United Nations system, the Micronesian people\nhave worked tirelessly to forge our own identity at the\ninternational level.\nFifteen years ago, we entered into a relationship\nof Free Association with the United States of America.\nIt is a relationship largely unprecedented in\ninternational relations. This arrangement was subject to\ngreat scrutiny by the United Nations, which ultimately\napproved the end of our status as a United Nations\nTrust Territory. It is testimony to the efforts of this\nbody and the United Nations system that I stand before\nyou today as the representative of a nation \u2014 an equal\nin the community of nations.\nFor hundreds of years, our culture was isolated\nfrom the rest of the world. In the past 10 years, our\nmembership in the United Nations has opened up new\nhorizons, new partnerships and a new understanding of\npeoples. We also note our appreciation for the special\nknowledge we have gained through our interactions\nwith all of you here in this forum and elsewhere in the\nUnited Nations system.\nIn the past 10 years, the world, like Micronesia\nitself, has changed at a pace heretofore unknown.\nAlthough we may celebrate some victories in conflict\nprevention, clearly, other grave challenges remain, and\nnew threats to international peace and security have\nemerged. We are encouraged at seeing the United\nNations assert its leadership in combating these\nproblems.\nThe past year has brought an ambitious slate of\nnew United Nations initiatives to enhance the well-\nbeing of peoples throughout the world. There are far\nmore noteworthy new initiatives than I have time to\nmention here. But please allow me to highlight a few of\nthem.\nWhile the effects of some grave threats to the\nFederated States of Micronesia will gradually manifest\nthemselves over the coming decades, my nation is\ncurrently grappling with an ongoing and immediate\nconcern: poverty. I am not speaking of the poverty of\nhunger and unchecked disease, but of the all-too-\ncommon developing world condition that has resulted\nfrom the persistent failure of all nations to achieve\nequal and equitable sharing of the world\u2019s bounties.\nUnfortunately, we are not alone, but this provides little\nsolace. We applaud the United Nations as it continues\nits heroic work to reduce poverty and to bring a better\nstandard of living to all peoples of the world. We will\ncontinue to work with our colleagues within the Group\nof 77 and China to further poverty reduction measures\nand to improve the standard of living of all humankind.\nThe historic isolation of the Federated States of\nMicronesia has sheltered us from the scourge of many\ncommunicable diseases, such as AIDS. Our integration\nwith the world community has brought about change\nhere as well. In this past year my country experienced\nits first domestic case of HIV infection. This is minor\nin comparison to the experience of those countries that\nhave been devastated by the disease, but it is cause for\nconcern, nonetheless, in a country of little more than\n100,000 people. We wholeheartedly support United\nNations initiatives in this regard, such as the recently\nconcluded General Assembly special session on\nHIV/AIDS.\nTraditional conflicts remain and, most troubling,\nmany old animosities have spilled over into open\nhostilities. This serves to underscore the importance of\nUnited Nations initiatives, such as this year\u2019s World\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which recently\nconcluded in Durban, South Africa.\nAfter many years of overall peace and\ntranquillity, our region of the Pacific islands has\nrecently seen a few long-standing conflicts erupt into\nviolence of disturbing proportions. We applaud the\nefforts of the United Nations aimed at arriving at\npeaceful settlements, and the Federated States of\nMicronesia lends its full support to ongoing measures\ndesigned to keep the peace.\nIn the Pacific, one of the most effective means to\nthat end has always been the Pacific Islands Forum. In\nthe 30 years of its existence, the Pacific Islands Forum\nhas played a pivotal role in maintaining the peace and\nsecurity of our region. It has also contributed to notable\nprogress on a broad slate of economic and social\nissues. I was pleased to participate in the recent\nmeeting of the Forum and can express my country\u2019s\nfull support for this year\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, which has\nbeen issued as a document of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\n3\n\nAs a nation with one of the youngest populations\nin the world, the issues of children and youth are of\nutmost concern to us. We therefore commend the\ndecision to hold the special session of the General\nAssembly on children. We understand fully the need to\nreschedule it and are gratified that the Assembly has\ndecided to hold this session next May in order to give\nthe issues of children and youth the prominence they\ndeserve. On a related note, I am pleased to report that\nthe Federated States of Micronesia has begun the\nprocess of evaluation with a view to signing and\nratifying the two Optional Protocols to the Convention\non the Rights of the Child.\nGiven the monumental pace of change, it is not\nsurprising that in some respects the United Nations\nitself has been unable to keep pace with developments.\nWe are appreciative of ongoing reform efforts, but we\nwould encourage redoubled efforts on remaining\nmatters that cry out for attention, such as the\nreconstitution of the Security Council.\nWhile my nation grapples with the entire\nspectrum of transnational problems, such as drug\ntrafficking and other aspects of international criminal\nactivity, there is one threat that has our special\nattention. I am speaking, of course, about the\naccelerated rise in sea level caused by global climate\nchange. We now know that the production of\ngreenhouse gases by human activity plays a prominent\nrole. It is this global issue that threatens my country\u2019s\nfuture as no other.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia contributes\nonly in an infinitesimal way to the problem of human-\ninduced climate change; yet we are among the \u201cfront-\nline\u201d States that must deal with its impacts. We are\ncomprised of a geologically diverse range of islands,\nfrom low-level coral atolls to mountainous volcanic\noutcrops. All share one common denominator \u2014 since\nthe dawn of time, our people\u2019s livelihood has been tied\nto the sea. Even on our high islands, such as Pohnpei\nand Kosrae, the vast majority of the population on all\nislands lives in the coastal plain. On most islands, the\npossibility of moving to higher ground does not exist.\nThe distinguished scientists of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\nhave confirmed that the climate is changing and that\nhuman activities are playing a significant part in the\nwarming of our planet. Credible scientific evidence\nsuggests that the magnitude of the impact of that\nwarming may be greater than even the most extreme\nestimates just 10 years ago. Indeed, it may already be\ntoo late to save my country and many others like it\nworldwide.\nAlready, our region has seen the beginnings of the\nmovement of its peoples as a result of the rise in sea\nlevel caused by global warming. This year, Tuvalu, one\nof our similarly situated neighbours in the region,\nannounced that it had begun examining relocation\noptions. Unfortunately, its initial results were not\nencouraging, as there is no uniform willingness among\nmore fortunate countries to provide a haven for these\nfirst \u201cclimate change refugees\u201d. Undoubtedly, it will be\nthe outlying atolls of the Federated States of\nMicronesia, home to about half of our population, that\nare among the next to join the people of Tuvalu if\ncurrent trends continue.\nThese developments point with new urgency to\nthe need for constructive discussion of adaptation\nstrategies and funding for small island developing\nStates. We are encouraged by the new attention paid to\nthese issues at the recent conference in Bonn, and we\nwelcome the constructive outcomes of the conference\njust completed in Marrakesh with regard to such\nimportant issues as the enforcement of compliance.\nWe and all other parties to the Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, signed nine years ago,\nwere motivated by the \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d,\nwhereby the lack of airtight scientific certainty could\nnot be the basis for inaction. Today, virtually no\nuncertainty remains as to the reality of the main\nproblem. Yet we are dismayed to see that in the media\nand elsewhere a handful of \u201cgreenhouse gas sceptics\u201d\nare often still given a podium equal to that given to the\ndistinguished scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change.\nIn the past 10 years we have seen some progress\nin the form of the Framework Convention and the\nKyoto Protocol, thanks to the tireless efforts of many\ndelegations and good will on the part of Governments.\nHowever, a change in the position of several key\nsignatories to the Protocol, which are also among the\nworld\u2019s largest generators of greenhouse gases,\nundermines the success of the recent Bonn and\nMarrakesh talks, and has created a great deal of\nconcern on the part of all low-lying island States. We\nwarmly applaud those countries that have stood by\ntheir commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n4\n\nWe call upon those that have not to find the political\nwill to take the actions that are, after all, in their own\nlong-term best interests.\nI do not mean to ignore the initial economic\nhardships these changes might entail; we understand\nthem all too well. In the last five years, the Federated\nStates of Micronesia has taken unprecedented measures\nto reduce the size of its public sector, far and away the\nlargest employer in my country. These moves were\nvastly unpopular politically. Still, they were necessary\nand have put us on the right footing for a sustainable\neconomic future. Similarly, longer-term economic\nbenefits and competitive advantage can be gained by\nthose nations that adopt a progressive climate change\nstrategy.\nWe Micronesians are a proud people. Throughout\nthe centuries, we have endured seemingly\ninsurmountable difficulties. The threat from climate\nchange is only the latest of these. Like some others we\nhave faced, it is not of our own making, and it is not\nsomething that we can overcome by ourselves. The\nKyoto Protocol, as it has been hammered out in\nMarrakesh, provides a necessary mechanism with\nwhich most nations can begin to attack global\nwarming. I congratulate the negotiators on their\nsignificant, even historic, accomplishment. The\nemission cuts agreed to, however, amount to only a\nsmall first step.\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate the sincere\ncondolences of the people of the Federated States of\nMicronesia to those in all regions of the world who are\nsuffering today from violence, poverty, terrorism and\nthe violation of human rights. We pray for a peaceful\nend to the current conflicts raging throughout many\nregions.\nWe are reassured that the spirit and principles of\nthe United Nations will guide leaders as they strive to\nprevent future outbreaks of violence while seeking to\nrelieve current suffering. My delegation is proud of its\ncontributions during our first 10 years of membership\nand pledges to do its utmost to continue to advance the\ngoals of the United Nations for the betterment of all\npeople throughout the world.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\nconveying my deepest sympathy and condolences to\nthe families and relatives of the victims of American\nAirlines flight 587, which crashed in this great city two\ndays ago, exactly two months and one day after the 11\nSeptember terrorist attack. The people of New York are\nonce again being put to the test, and once again they\nwill come out of this tragedy more resolved and\ndetermined, under the leadership of Mayor Giuliani and\nGovernor Pataki. While we pray for the victims and\ntheir families, let us also pray that the crash, as tragic\nas it was, will prove to be an accident and not an act of\nterrorism.\nIn the wake of an unfathomable, barbarous act of\nterror against a civilian population made up of citizens\nfrom nations around the globe, we gather together in\nunprecedented unity. We are united in our sorrow over\nthe losses arising from 11 September \u2014 the loss of\nlives, the loss of friends and loved ones, the loss of\nlivelihoods and the loss of innocence, for want of a\nbetter word. We are united in our condemnation of the\nhorrific acts perpetrated by an isolated group of\nextremists who have no respect for human life. We are\nunited in our resolve that those responsible for the\natrocities of 11 September, and those who support\nthem, are a cancer in the body of nations \u2014 a systemic\nblight which extends beyond the individual\nperpetrators and which must be utterly eradicated, lest\nit return and spread.\nAt the same time, we are united in our conviction\nthat their evil cannot be allowed to force us to abandon\nrespect for human rights and adherence to the rule of\nlaw, which are fundamental principles of this\nOrganization. We are united in our recognition that, for\nall their claims to holiness, those responsible for these\ncriminal acts of terror bear no legitimate claim to any\ncivilized religion and certainly do not represent the\nnoble and honourable beliefs of Islam. We are united in\nour understanding that the peoples of Afghanistan are\nalso victims of the corruption and ill-fated control of\ntheir Government by these criminals and their\nsupporters, as well as in our desire to assist in\nimproving the quality of life of the people of\nAfghanistan. In all these things and more, we are\nunited to a degree that would have been unthinkable\nbefore 11 September.\n2\n\nThis new spirit of cooperation reflects the most\npositive feature of globalization \u2014 the feature which\npro-globalization factions do not often put forward and\nanti-globalization forces never consider. It is the only\nfeature of globalization that Pacific island countries\nsuch as Palau can see as being truly and inherently\npositive \u2014 a feature that the Pacific island countries\nhave recognized among themselves for decades. That\nfeature is the acknowledgement that, ultimately, there\nis only one system in which we exist, and the related\nunderstanding that any act or condition within that\nsystem affects each of us, although in varying ways and\ndegrees. In such a system, problems are best addressed\nthrough coalition-building and a consensus-driven\napproach, a process of give and take, involving the\nwidest possible range of participants. We see proof of\nthis as the world continues to cooperate in responding\nto the 11 September attacks against humanity.\nAs I have said, in this new spirit of cooperation,\nthe process of decision-making and the implementation\nof those decisions must be as open and participatory as\npossible. This is especially true in the light of the need\nto weave together military, financial, law enforcement,\ntrade, intelligence-gathering and foreign aid issues. In\nthese troubled times, it simply makes no sense to\nisolate a proven ally in the fight against terrorism. Yet\nthat is what is happening. The Republic of China on\nTaiwan, which could and should be a very valuable\nasset in these and other cooperative actions, is\nsignificantly restricted in the role it can play because it\nhas been barred from membership in this body. In fact,\nit is the only nation in the world which has no voice in\nthis Organization.\nNot only is the exclusion of Taiwan contrary to\nthe fundamental, inclusive principles of the United\nNations, but on a more pragmatic level it compromises\nsecurity in Asia and the Pacific. Lacking a neutral\nforum for the non-violent, diplomatic resolution of any\ndisputes it might have with the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, the Republic of China on Taiwan is at a great\ndisadvantage in maintaining stable and peaceful\nrelations in the region. It is simply counterproductive,\nfrom either a practical or a political viewpoint, to\nexclude from this body a peaceful, democratically\ngoverned, economically vibrant nation which embraces\nhuman rights and plays a major role in other\ninternational organizations.\nSimilarly, it makes no sense, in this new global\nsystem, to ignore an entire bloc of nations because of\nperceptions left over from an earlier, colonial-era\nworld. Yet the Pacific island countries are still being\nmarginalized in the various United Nations bodies and\nprocesses. It is time to recognize that the Pacific island\ncountries are unique entities, island countries with\ndistinct traditions, cultures, needs, interests and\nconcerns and are not merely the leftovers of\ncolonialism. It is time to recognize that they are among\nthe youngest nations of the world, with special\nrequirements for assistance in assuming their proper\nplace in the global arena. Those needs, interests and\nconcerns are often overlooked against the larger\nbackdrop of the Asia-Pacific Group in the United\nNations. It is time to change that; to deal more fully\nwith the Pacific island countries as such, rather than as\nan afterthought tagged onto Asia.\nResolutions have been put forward which could\ncorrect the erroneous exclusion of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, pave the way to providing a properly\nexpanded role for the Pacific island countries as such,\nand produce greater cooperation and broader support in\nall the key works of the United Nations. Now is the\ntime for the membership to adopt those resolutions in\nrecognition of the need for full participation of all\npeoples in the global events unfolding now and sure to\ndevelop in the foreseeable future.\nMoreover, it is equally important in this new\nglobalization and world order that the most important\norgan of the United Nations, the Security Council, be\nreorganized and restructured to reflect true\nrepresentation of this Organization. While we\ncommend and applaud the five permanent members of\nthe Security Council for their efforts and contributions\nto world peace and security, the time has come for this\nbody to consider the inclusion of several Member\nStates as permanent members of the Security Council.\nJapan, among few others, has certainly reached the\nlevel and capacity to be one of the permanent members\nof the Security Council. In this respect, we applaud the\nrecent decision of the Japanese Government to send\nsupport forces to the United States-led coalition war\nagainst international terrorism.\nFinally, if it can be said that any good came from\nthe abominations of 11 September, it would be this:\ncountries of the world that gave little thought to\nengagement and cooperation in a larger, global system\nare now fully engaged and working side by side with\ncountries to which they were formerly antagonistic or\nto which they gave only passing thought, at best. This\n3\n\nnew perspective can and should be applied to respond\nto another global attack, one that is even more basic\nthan terrorism and will remain a threat to humanity\nafter the criminals of 11 September are brought to\njustice.\nThis threat arises from the attack on our own\necosystem through desertification, through the\nreduction in global biodiversity and through global\nwarming and sea-level rise, all resulting from human\nactivities. These attacks, infinitely less dramatic than\nthose of 11 September, are nonetheless equally\nsystemic in nature and equally threatening to us all. It\nis time to apply the same new understanding of global\ndynamics, so forcefully driven home on 11 September,\nto our environment.\nWe applaud and are very much encouraged by the\ndevelopments of the recently concluded seventh\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in\nMorocco. To that end, I want to repeat my oft-stated\ncall for all nations to finalize negotiations on, sign,\nratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\npossible. Just as we must now directly confront the\neffects of transnational acts of terror, we must now\ndirectly confront the environmental consequences of\nour own actions. Delay on either matter is unacceptable\nand will only further compromise our well-being.\nFor perhaps the first time in its glorious history,\nthe phrase \u201cUnited Nations\u201d literally describes this\nOrganization. While we remain shocked, saddened and\ndeeply offended by the events giving rise to the new\nunity, we must acknowledge and nurture whatever\ngood those events can be turned to. We now have the\nability to see the clear advantages of close cooperation\non matters which affect us all. Let us use the\nknowledge, that wisdom gained from pain, and forge\neven stronger, institutional reliance on cooperation,\nconsensus and coalition-building across the widest\npossible constituency as we go forward in this new\nglobal system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\nbehalf of the Comorian delegation, which I have the\nhonour to lead, and on my own behalf, I offer you, Sir,\nour warmest congratulations on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. We\nexpress the ardent hope that our work, under your\nenlightened leadership, will be successful.\nMy delegation and I pay a ringing tribute to your\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the excellent\nmanner in which he led the work of the previous\nsession. As to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nI praise the merits of that man of such great talent and\nexemplary wisdom, and I also pay tribute to his\ndedication to the service of our world Organization.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded to him,\ntogether with our Organization, is concrete proof of his\noutstanding values.\nOn 11 September, the entire world was plunged\ninto gloom and anarchy. Terrorist networks defied the\nentire international community through their\nreprehensible attacks on American interests here in\nNew York, this global, hospitable and cosmopolitan\ncity \u2014 this capital of the entire world.\nThus, I cannot fail in my duty to convey, from\nthis rostrum, the deep sympathy and compassion of the\nGovernment and people of the Comoros to the\nAmerican people and Government following those\npainful, tragic and most unfortunate events. We offer\nour most grief-stricken condolences in particular to the\nfamilies of the victims, whose terrible pain we share\nfollowing these sudden deaths.\nFurthermore, we were deeply moved by the loss\nof lives in the aeroplane accident that took place last\nMonday here in New York. We extend our sincere\ncondolences to the Governments and peoples of the\nUnited States and the Dominican Republic and to the\nbereaved families.\nIn the course of the previous session and of the\nMillennium Summit, the central role that has been and\nmust continue to be played by our Organization was\nbroadly reaffirmed in many statements. The reform of\nthe main organ responsible for international peace and\nsecurity to make it reflect the realities of today\u2019s world\nwas seen by all to be a priority. Today more than ever\nbefore, that role must be strengthened, because the\nUnited Nations responsibility requires it to be better\nequipped fully and effectively to assume it.\nIn this respect, it is appropriate to point out that\nthis responsibility is of a different order. Above and all,\nit is the responsibility \u201cto save succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war\u201d, to cite the expression of the\nCharter that governs our institution. This primary\nresponsibility requires the Organization to ensure the\npeace and security of peoples. Today, crises of all sorts\nand the precariousness of the cause of peace in many\nregions demonstrate the United Nations highly difficult\ntask in assuming that responsibility. The varied threats\nto peace that are spreading throughout the world call\non us to focus greater attention on taking urgent\ninternational action, for no continent is safe from the\ndanger.\nTerrorism is one component of that danger. We\nmust not allow extremist groups, regardless of their\npretexts, to plunge the world into perpetual psychosis\nand to claim millions of innocents as their unfortunate\nvictims. The attacks of 11 September were a harsh\nblow for all of us, a challenge to all mankind. The\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros therefore\nstrongly condemned those hateful and barbarous acts,\njust as it condemns terrorism in all its forms.\nThus, in the framework of mobilizing efforts to\ncombat terrorism, the conferences held in Doha and\nDakar last month, in which the Government of the\nComoros played an active role, reified the commitment\nof the Arab world and the African continent to this\ndifficult but necessary struggle. In the same way, the\nmeeting in Brussels brought the countries of Europe\n20\n\ntogether in a manifestation of the continent\u2019s abiding\nconcern over terrorism.\nIn this approach, however, it is first necessary to\ndefine the notion of terrorism by clearly establishing\nwhat constitutes State, group and individual terrorism.\nWe must then distinguish between terrorist acts and the\nlegitimate claims of certain peoples to their right to\nself-determination, which indubitably cannot be\nexercised without confrontation, since it is often met\nwith resistance and even oppression. Finally, it is\nessential that we in no way confuse terrorism with\nIslam, since we know, on the one hand, that every\nterrorist act is the expression of an extremism that is by\nno means linked to a given religion or nation, and that,\non the other, Islam is known for its great tolerance and\nopenness, advocating love of one\u2019s fellow man, peace\nand solidarity.\nWith respect to my country, the Islamic Federal\nRepublic of the Comoros, the concern of our highest\nauthorities vis-\u00e0-vis this problem has led them to\nestablish a national mechanism to combat terrorism,\nwhich has been placed under the leadership of the\nPrime Minister. In January 2000, my country also\nsigned the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. In addition\nto such national commitments on the part of every one\nof our countries, it is clear that we will need to engage\nin international action by joining regional and\ncontinental forces to fight this scourge, which threatens\nworld peace and destabilizes the economies of our\ncountries.\nThis requires an objective political reading of the\nsituation prevailing in areas of tension throughout the\nworld. From that perspective, the situation in the\noccupied Arab territories, among other problems, calls\nfor our attention today. The Palestinian people has the\nsame right as every other nation on Earth to life,\nhappiness, prosperity, peace and security. That is why,\nin respect for the law and in order to reach a just,\nlasting and definitive solution to this problem, the\nComorian Government believes that an independent\nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,\nis necessary. From another point of view, the United\nNations has the responsibility to safeguard the welfare\nof peoples. That entails guaranteeing the conditions for\na better life by protecting fundamental human rights.\nIndeed, the serious diseases affecting our\ncountries, in particular the developing ones; difficult\naccess to better education and health care; the famine\nthat afflicts several regions of the world; the\ndeterioration of our environment; and the violation of\nhuman rights remain the major challenges to our\nmillennium. Some of these evils, such as famine,\nserious disease and the extreme poverty afflicting many\ncountries, are in themselves very eloquent\nmanifestations of a gap between North and South that\nwe will ultimately have to bridge.\nAs to disease, AIDS is at the heart of our\ndiscussions and concerns, because it kills, empties\nentire regions and every year creates millions of\norphans whose future is bleak. Thus, in the Islamic\nFederal Republic of the Comoros, despite a relatively\nlow rate of incidence, the Government remains aware\nthat the country\u2019s geographical position and the\nprevalence of tourism in our island subregion are\nfactors that could contribute to the rapid spread of the\ndisease, given the influx of tourists and seasonal\nholiday-makers.\nThat is why our Government is devoted to\nmaking the national programme against AIDS a useful\ntool by giving it, as much as possible, the appropriate\nmeans, with the undeniable help of the World Health\nOrganization and Joint United Nations Programme on\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The commitment of the\nGovernment of Comoros to this fight against AIDS is\nalso expressed by its participation in all regional or\ninternational measures to this effect. Thus, a delegation\nfrom Comoros, led by His Excellency Mr. Hamada\nMadi Bol\u00e9ro, the Prime Minister, took part last June in\nthe special session of the General Assembly on AIDS,\nheld in this city. The recommendations from that\nsession were borne in mind by our national authorities.\nSpeaking of diseases, I should not overlook\nmalaria, which still affects many regions. In Comoros,\nit affects all layers of society and becomes a source of\nmajor concern for the national authorities. This is why,\nbeyond the national provisions within the framework of\nthe national strategy to fight malaria, my country\nwelcomes the initiative to proclaim the period 2001-\n2010 the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Africa.\nI spoke earlier about the gap that separates\neconomies of the North from those of the South. From\nthis point of view, the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\nBrussels in May 2001, is of particular interest for our\ncountries, and we count on more resolute commitment\n21\n\nfrom all of us, rich and poor countries, so that the\nrecommendations made on that occasion and those that\nwill be adopted within the framework of the conference\nthat is currently being held in Doha, in Qatar, will lead\nto positive changes and lay a solid basis for sustainable\nand effective development by revitalizing our\neconomies.\nOur peoples expect much from our Organization,\nrecognized as offering the best framework to guarantee\nthe fundamental rights of all. This is why, confident in\nthe United Nations to ensure the respect for unity and\nterritorial integrity of our respective countries, the\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros urges our\nOrganization to consider the legitimate claim of the\nChinese Government with respect to the reintegration\nof the Chinese province of Taiwan in its natural entity.\nMy country, especially sensitive to this problem, as we\nourselves have had a painful secessionist experience,\nbelieves firmly in the need to find swift solutions to\nthis type of situation, which could undermine the\nstability of regions.\nThe Millennium Summit prompted great hopes,\nwhich we must turn into reality, in order to thus\nrecognize all the importance that it has in the eyes of\nhumanity. This means that there should be a follow-up\nof the recommendations made on this occasion. We can\nonly strongly wish that everyone will take due account\nof the true diagnosis made of our world in order to seek\ntogether the appropriate remedies.\nEveryone\u2019s interest and survival depends on this,\nbecause when our neighbour\u2019s peace is threatened, no\none is safe; likewise, as long as hunger, disease,\nignorance, violence, injustice and poverty still subsist\nin certain regions, they will be a cause of shame for all\nhumanity and a potential threat to peace and stability.\nA year after the last session, during which I spoke\nfrom this high rostrum on, among other points, the\ngeneral situation that prevailed in my country, the\nIslamic Federal Republic of the Comoros, I would like\nto speak about certain aspects of the way the situation\nis evolving. I am pleased to announce today that the\nprocess of national reconciliation, led by the Head of\nState of my country, His Excellency Colonel Azali\nAssoumani, in which he opted for direct dialogue with\nour brothers from the island of Anjouan, is making\nprogress daily.\nIndeed, at the present time, a draft constitution,\nwhich would govern the future of the whole of the\nComoros, has just been handed to the Head of State\nand will be submitted to a referendum before the end of\nthis year. All of the political parties took part in\ndrafting this document, and we also benefited from the\nassistance of the entire international community,\nincluding the Organization of African Unity, the\nOrganization of la Francophonie and the League of\nArab States with respect to expertise in constitutional\nlaw.\nAlongside these efforts, provisions are being\nmade to prepare the upcoming elections, for which the\ninternational community, through the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the European\nUnion, will also provide considerable technical\nassistance.\nIn this transitional phase towards the\nestablishment of new institutions, the Government of\nComoros is not sparing any effort to improve the\ncurrent conditions in order to allow our population to\nlead a decent and acceptable life. These significant\nefforts must of course be supported by the international\ncommunity in order to help the social sectors in\ndifficulty. The great challenge for our Government, in\naddition to this reconstruction now under way, remains\nthe achievement of harmonious social and economic\ndevelopment.\nThis is why, on behalf of the Government of\nComoros, I launch an urgent appeal to the entire\ninternational community to continue to provide its\nvaluable support in this period of national\nreconciliation for the reconstruction and establishment\nof institutions.\nThe secessionist crisis did not make us lose sight\nof the problem of the Comoran island of Mayotte,\nwhich is a major concern for the people and\nGovernment of my country. This island of Comoros,\nadministered by France, is completely cut off from the\nrest of the archipelago, thus limiting the free movement\nof people and goods among islands and leading to\nconsiderable human loss for people who want to reach\ntheir families in Mayotte.\nWhile the Government of Comoros is confident\nof the willingness of the French authorities to\ncooperate fully with their Comoran counterparts in\norder to find a lasting and negotiated solution to the\nproblem of the Comoran island of Mayotte, we\nreiterate our desire to see the international community\ntake part in this approach, out of respect for the law\n22\n\nand in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the\nUnited Nations that admitted Comoros to the United\nNations, once the new Comoran entity is set up to\nallow the return of Mayotte to its natural fold.\nLastly, I would like to extend our profound and\nsincere thanks to our fraternal countries and friends, to\nthe partners of Comoros that accompanied us in every\nway they could, in the search for a lasting solution to\nthe crisis that has shaken our country and is still\npresent in our struggle to preserve and perpetuate the\nprecious gains that we have made from the change of\n30 April 1999. May all the crises that are affecting the\nworld today see a fortunate conclusion in the interest of\nour peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation cannot\nfind the words to convey its sadness about the plane\ncrash that occurred in a residential area in New York\nthis morning. At moments like these, silence speaks for\nitself. The Government and the people of Suriname\noffer their heartfelt condolences to the families of all\nthe victims. We pray that our love and friendship may\nbring comfort and peace to all who have been affected\nby this tragedy and by the horrific attacks on 11\nSeptember.\nDuring the United Nations Year of Dialogue\namong Civilizations, the need for dialogue is proving\nto be essential throughout world. In Suriname, we have\nalways tried to apply the concept of dialogue.\nSuriname is a small country with a multi-ethnic\npopulation. Our ancestors came to Suriname\ngenerations ago from West Africa, China, India,\nIndonesia, Europe and the Middle East. We have been\nfortunate that, owing to mutual respect and\nunderstanding, in Suriname these groups have lived\ntogether and are living together peacefully. More than\never, we realize that this harmony should be treasured\nand nurtured, since we can no longer take peace and\nharmony for granted.\nOur Government plays a very important role in\nthis peaceful coexistence, because we have strongly\npromoted and actively worked for mutual respect and\nconsensus. We believe that for people to be actively\ninvolved in the development of the country, they must\nbe able to see themselves represented in national and\nlocal government. We strongly promote such consensus\ndemocracy in Suriname, for this power-sharing\narrangement has stimulated all ethnic groups to be\ntolerant and respectful of each other's political\nideologies, cultures and religions. Our Government and\nour people firmly uphold the principle of freedom of\nreligion, as well as of tolerance and respect for each\nother's forms of cultural expression.\nIn the same vein, the indigenous people of\nSuriname live in the interior with their own cultural\nand religious beliefs. The needs and rights of\nindigenous people are dealt with at the highest level in\nour Government. Their views and concerns are shared\nwith the central Government through continuous\ndialogue. My Government therefore looks forward to\nthe first conference of the Permanent Forum on\nIndigenous Issues, scheduled to take place in May\n2002.\nWe know, and have experience of the fact, that\npeople's primordial attachments become stronger at\ntimes of need and despair. The grief of families from\nthe United States of America and other parts of the\nworld has been deeply felt, and all over the globe many\nfamilies and groups have turned to each other for\ncomfort. Our hearts go out to all of the victims of the\n11 September attacks and their families.\nWe cannot yet assess all the social and economic\neffects of those attacks. However, we have already seen\nthe devastating effects on the Caribbean in terms of\nloss of income in, for example, tourism and trade.\nNatural disasters have also affected our area, and my\ndelegation sympathizes with the people of the\nCaribbean, especially those of Belize and Cuba, whose\ncountries were recently struck by hurricanes Iris and\nMichelle.\nAs a member of the Caribbean Community, we\nknow that we have grave problems in the region.\nLimited access to global markets because of stringent\ntrade rules and World Trade Organization (WTO)\nregulations have resulted in increased poverty in our\nregion. Suriname pleads for an institutional\narrangement between the United Nations and the WTO\nso as to allow developing countries easier access to that\nbody.\nWe have further expanded and deepened our\nregional ties. In this respect, we would like to express\nour gratitude to the countries of the western\nhemisphere which have offered us assistance and\nshown their support for including us in the various\nintegration movements.\nWe in the Caribbean enjoy a high level of\ndemocracy and are guided by the rule of law. Our\nGovernments have been actively involved in creating\n5\n\nan environment to attract foreign investors and to\nincrease the production of goods and services. We still\nneed assistance. The promises made by the developed\ncountries in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 have\nnot yielded an increase in official development\nassistance. We, the countries in development, need\nequal opportunities.\nIf we, as the international community, agree that\nhuman-centred development is at the top of our agenda,\nwe need to understand that we have to achieve it\ntogether. If our goal is to eradicate abject poverty, we\nmust make an effort to achieve that goal. Cutting in\nhalf by 2015 the number of people living on less than\n$l a day is one of the main goals we want to achieve\nfor the benefit of the truly disadvantaged.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, to be held in March 2002 in Mexico,\nwill give both developed and developing countries an\nopportunity to reach concrete agreements and make\narrangements for resources for development. If we do\nnot take the opportunity offered by that Conference to\nwork towards sustainable development for all people in\nthe world, we will miss a great chance to achieve a\nmore equitable distribution of global wealth.\nIf we do not take that opportunity, we will also\nmiss the chance to intensify our struggle to combat\ndeadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, which\naffect millions in the world. We in the Caribbean have\ncommitted ourselves to continue the struggle against\nHIV/AIDS in our region. We must not lose sight of the\nfact that people are still dying every day of this\ndisease. It is up to us, the international community, to\nfind solutions and improve the lives of those billions of\npeople who are faced with global problems such as\nextreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\nilliteracy, as well as problems resulting from the debt\nburden, the refugee issue, environmental degradation\nand the widening gap between rich and poor.\nSuriname has made great efforts in gender\nequality, and, with the assistance of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, we have begun training\nprogrammes in gender sensitivity. We have women in\nhigh-level positions, and it gives me great pleasure to\ntell the Assembly that our current delegation consists\nmainly of women. We are pleased with this\ndevelopment in my country, but we still have a long\nway to go.\nOur commitment to the role of women has\nprompted my country to work on a draft resolution in\nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly on\nmainstreaming the situation of older women into\nsociety, to ensure that that part of the population will\nnot be marginalized further in our societies.\nAgeing has become a subject of increasing\nconcern to the international community, for it raises\nsignificant social and cultural questions, as well as\nquestions of economic stability. My Government will\njoin the international community and the United\nNations to address and support the United Nations\ninitiative to achieve a society for all ages. We should\ncome up with appropriate strategies to collectively deal\nwith these issues during the Second World Assembly\non Ageing.\nHuman development constitutes one of the key\npillars of the development policy of my Government.\nPeople, especially our children, are our country's\ngreatest treasure. This is why looking after their well-\nbeing is placed high on our national agenda. Suriname\nis looking forward to the Special Session on Children\nthat has been postponed to 2002.\nSuriname hopes that the World Summit on\nSustainable Development of 2002, in Johannesburg,\nand the assessment of the Earth Summit of June 1992,\nwill lead to recommendations and commitments for the\nimplementation of real sustainable human development\nin a globally sustainable environment. Protecting the\nenvironment is the responsibility of all countries.\nSuriname took a first step in conserving biodiversity\nfor contemporary and future generations by\nestablishing the largest protected nature reserve in\nSouth America three years ago. With this first step, we\nhope to encourage other countries in the world to\nprotect the environment, and to work together on the\nmany emerging global environmental threats.\nSuriname is extremely concerned about the trans-\nshipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea,\nbut we are pleased to see that so many countries have\nratified the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe ever-widening global digital divide that\nprevents developing countries from benefiting fully\nfrom the advancements in information technology is a\nconcern that we have discussed in various international\nforums, but it still needs much more of our attention.\n6\n\nThe effects of globalization have not been\nfavourable to most developing countries. However, we\nhave come to understand and experience that our world\nis an interdependent one, and we cannot turn back this\nclock. The attacks of the 11 September have shown us\nhow interdependent we are. The loss of lives was\ndirectly felt in the United States and in more than 80\ncountries in the rest of the world. The economic effects\nare also being felt in all parts of the world.\nIn conclusion, the Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations received the Nobel Peace Prize this\nyear at a time when the world was still trying to\ncomprehend the horrific attacks of 11 September on the\nUnited States. Suriname hopes that this distinguished\naward will encourage the United Nations to continue\nits important work for human rights, peace, social\njustice, human development, human-rights education\nand economic prosperity for all the peoples of the\nworld. We congratulate the Secretary-General on this\nprestigious award and his re-election. And we\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election as President and\nlook forward to his guidance and leadership during the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nAs members of the United Nations family, we are\ncalled upon to practice tolerance and to live together in\npeace with one another as good neighbours. Because of\nthe devastating consequences of 11 September, we\nhave the obligation to look closely at the root causes of\nterrorism. The causes of terrorism have to be discussed\nand dealt with to protect all our peoples and interests.\nFor the world is our home, and we are the people who\nlive in it.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwant first of all to stress that, under the current\ncircumstances, our presence \u2014 everybody\u2019s\npresence \u2014 at this general debate unquestionably takes\non special significance.\nEvery year, the United Nations prepares and\nsubmits to Member States for their consideration a\ncomprehensive agenda containing many items of varied\nscope and nature. This session is no exception: the\nUnited Nations will not stop.\nYet, many things now appear completely\ndifferent. The city of New York, the United States and\nevery country, and the people of the United States and\nevery people \u2014 all of humankind \u2014 have been cruelly\nattacked by terrorism, and its threat hangs over every\none of us and over natural and peaceful relations\namong the peoples of the world. In short, this is a\nglobal phenomenon that demands of us a global answer\nand that has marked the start of the new millennium.\nThe nations of my continent believe that to be so. The\nstatements made by the Presidents of Brazil and of\nMexico, which I endorse, made that perfectly clear.\nThe Millennium Summit, which brought us\ntogether here last year, provided an opportunity for us\nto identify the issues that affect us all and that we must\nface as part of a challenge that no one can avoid. It\n19\n\ndefined an agenda of peace and hope for a world\naffected by common problems, although, it must be\nsaid, in different ways.\nToday, we face a new scenario. Perhaps as never\nbefore, all of us, and hence the United Nations, have a\ncommon goal: to respond to terrorism, irrespective of\nboundaries, ideologies, religions, races and cultures.\nThat commitment, undertaken with responsibility,\ninvolves taking every possible action without ever\nforgetting the higher goal: peace, whose supreme\nguarantee must continue to be international law and the\nconventions and treaties to which we are parties.\nBut there is no doubt that such a commitment is\nnot enough. We must fight every form of terrorism at\nevery level, domestic and international, and on every\nfront \u2014 legal, military, security and intelligence,\nadministrative and management. This demands of us\nstrong conviction, confidence in our shared values,\nfaith in humankind and the affirmation of life as the\nhighest value.\nTerrorism is blind and wicked by definition.\nBlind because it does not conceive or communicate\ngoals shared by the rest and so plunges into\nirrationality. Wicked because it indiscriminately\ndestroys people and property and sows fear, anxiety\nand sometimes panic.\nNevertheless, to fight it it will also be necessary\nto move against other enemies of peace, such as\npoverty and underdevelopment, to give every person\ngood reason to live and to make all of us guardians of\nhumankind, which is a common good from which no\none must feel excluded, and for which we must fight\nunwaveringly.\nThere is no cause or banner that could justify this\nviolence. That is precisely why we must prevent\nmarginalization, helplessness and desperation from\ntaking root in people\u2019s souls so that they look\napprovingly and complacently on the criminal actions\nof which we are victims.\nOur task, then, is to galvanize everyone\u2019s spirit in\nthe struggle against terrorism, because terrorism not\nonly fails to help solve the problems afflicting society\nas a whole but also fills it with fear and plunges it into\nparalysis and confusion.\nWe move with ever greater determination towards\na world and, consequently, towards a society that is\nevidently more and more globalized. The events of 11\nSeptember demonstrate that very clearly. Every people\nand every Government has been affected by those\nevents.\nWe are all involved in what happens, in a more\nprofound way than ever, because what happened not\nonly affects the security of the people; it raises\nquestions that are much simpler, but the answers to\nwhich are complex: what are all of our lives going to\nbe like from now on? What is the life of my family\ngoing to be like? Of my children? Of my parents? And\nof the others, my neighbours, my friends? How will the\nsimple acts of my life change? Will I be able to travel,\nreceive letters, use transportation and cross bridges \u2014\nwithout second thoughts, as was natural to us before?\nThis world and, in particular, the United Nations\nface a challenge for which they are not duly prepared.\nWe have created the technological and communication\nmeans to unify the planet and globalize it. But we\nneither know how nor have the proper instruments to\nproperly manage this process.\nWe are living through an amazing revolution, and\nit must be guided \u2014 driving it forward if it stalls,\nlimiting it if it goes too far \u2014 in order to achieve the\ngoals enabling the structuring of a new, balanced\ninternational system that takes into account the changes\nthat have occurred for humankind over the last 50\nyears.\nThe United Nations was born as a response to a\nworld that today no longer exists. The instruments and\ninstitutions it created in the past were a response to\npast realities \u2014 replaced today by new realities \u2014 in\nthe political, demographic, cultural, religious and\necological spheres.\nAll the many countries that make up this global\nsociety and that, together, navigate through space, have\nthe obligation of confronting this new reality, drawing\non our diversity.\nUruguay, a small country, but one with a long\ninternational tradition \u2014 it was a participant in the\n1907 Hague Conference to implement arbitration as the\nmethod for resolving conflicts, a member of the League\nof Nations and a founding Member of the United\nNations in San Francisco \u2014 feels that this is our\ncurrent situation, and we are ready to shoulder our due\nshare of responsibility.\nIn the past, we created international financial and\nmonetary institutions, and others for international\n20\n\ntrade, such as the World Trade Organization, which is\nmeeting today in Doha. All these institutions govern\nour activities and determine what we must do. But they\nnever act in concert. While the world is global, their\ndecisions are sectoral or singular.\nWhile loans are granted to us or fiscal or\nmonetary adjustments are required of us, the doors to\nmarkets do not at the same time open to our products\nand our labour. This way, instead of participating in the\nprocess of globalization, we are closed in nearly sealed\ncompartments. Those who have attained a certain level\nof growth grow even more, while the rest, save a few\nexceptions, suffer losses and fall further away from the\nlevels that would make it possible to enjoy the\nnecessary prosperity.\nToday the planet has 6 billion inhabitants. Only\n1.1 billion of them live in developed areas. In 2050, not\nlong from now \u2014 my grandchildren will not yet have\nreached my age \u2014 the planet will have 9.3 billion\ninhabitants, but still only 1.1 billion will live in\ndeveloped areas.\nPoverty not only destroys democracy. What is\nworse, it destroys societies and paves the way for\nviolence and, as we have often seen, even in our midst,\nall forms of terrorism.\nFinally, we consider it appropriate to repeat that\nwe are far from holding the answer necessary for the\nworld we have created.\nWe might not have spoken aloud these thoughts\nthat assuredly many of us have always had, had it not\nbeen for the thousands of innocent women and men\nthat died on that ill-fated 11 September. We owe to\nthem \u2014 whom Americans will always remember with\nlove and grief, feelings we also share \u2014 our most\nimportant responsibility: to see to it that they did not\ndie in vain.\nTheir tragic fate has shown us our duty. Now it is\ntime to do it.\n\n\n\n\n"

It is also a pleasure\nfor us to express the deep satisfaction of the\nGovernment of Panama at the well-deserved honour of\nthe award of the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, and to the Organization itself.\nAs we participate today in this forum, we are still\nreeling from the impact of the terrifying terrorist acts\ncarried out on 11 September in New York, Washington,\nD.C., and Pennsylvania. These crimes against humanity\nwill never be forgotten, and, as a tribute to the\nthousands of innocent victims of these senseless\nattacks, the United Nations must take whatever\nmeasures are necessary to legitimize any multilateral\naction that will have to be taken in future to neutralize\nthe threat of international terrorism.\nThe Republic of Panama, as a State Member of\nthe United Nations, fully respects the mandates issued\nby the Organization, and, therefore, we are pleased to\nstate here unambiguously that every resource available\nto us has been directed to fulfil our responsibilities in\nthe war against terrorism.\nSimilarly, we support the Security Council\nCommittee set up under resolution 1373 (2001),\nchaired by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, Sir Jeremy\nGreenstock. We propose to remain in communication\nwith him on an ongoing basis.\nThe Government of Panama, under the leadership\nof President Mireya Moscoso, is prepared vigorously to\nimplement the provisions contained in all United\nNations instruments on international terrorism. To that\nend, we will soon submit to our Legislative Assembly\nthe four United Nations instruments that have not yet\nbeen ratified by our country, together with the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism of December 1999, which we\nhave just signed here. Likewise, we will ratify, as soon\nas possible, the Rome Statute creating the International\nCriminal Court.\nIn parallel with the joint actions taken against\nterrorism in conformity with the many relevant United\nNations Conventions and resolutions of the General\nAssembly and the Security Council, and in order to\naddress terrorist activities, we respectfully appeal to all\nto set aside any differences that may have arisen in July\nin respect of the problem of massive illegal trade in\nsmall arms and light weapons. It is well known that the\nultimate beneficiaries of this deadly traffic are not only\nrebel movements \u2014 sometimes sponsored by other\nnations \u2014 but also notorious terrorist groups. That is\nwhy Panama reiterates the position it maintained\nduring the Conference: that no State has the right to\npromote this deadly traffic by claiming its own national\ninterests are at stake. This issue must be re-examined in\nthe light of recent events.\nThe Republic of Panama is particularly concerned\nat the social, political and economic implications of the\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons and wishes\nto declare its commitment to promoting an American\nconvention on this question, with a view to creating a\nlegal framework that will enable the countries of the\nhemisphere to completely suppress this traffic and thus\nstrengthen regional security.\nWe are caught up in a vortex of bloodshed that\nbrings us ever closer to generalized conflagrations. The\nStates represented here, when we became Members of\nthis Organization, undertook formally to promote peace\nand human rights; to meet the food, health care and\neducational needs of our peoples; to preserve the\nenvironment; and to bring about overall social,\neconomic and political development.\nHowever, for this commitment to have a real\neffect, we must secure the support of those States that,\ndue to pure fanaticism, particularly in the Middle East,\nhave not been able to come to terms with the purposes\nand principles of the United Nations. My country\nbelieves that the intolerance and intransigence\ndemonstrated in that part of the world are the result of\nancient ways of thinking and injustices that can be\neasily discerned and which constitute flagrant\nviolations of the United Nations Charter. The Republic\n4\n\nof Panama has repeatedly urged the parties in conflict\nto renounce the use of force, re-establish cooperation\non security and adopt measures to restore mutual trust,\nwhich enable a return to the peace process based on the\nnorms of international law.\nIn recent days, the international community has\nwitnessed with deep sadness the intensification of\nviolence in that region. Because of the brutality\noccurring in the Middle East, Panama considers that it\nis the responsibility of the United Nations to\nvigorously strengthen its mediating role in order to put\nan end to the unfortunate bloodshed that has grieved\nthe international community for decades.\nIn particular, Panama calls on the Security\nCouncil to assume a more active role in the efforts to\napply the recommendations of the Mitchell report,\nwhich proposes using constructive dialogue and mutual\nconcessions to move beyond the violence. An\nindispensable step is recognizing the right of the\nPalestinian people to create a sovereign State and the\nright of the State of Israel to live in peace and security.\nWe must make our best effort, employ our most\noutstanding human resources and put ourselves to the\ntask of reconciling all humankind. The Republic of\nPanama will persist in this task and will always\nadvocate peaceful solutions to conflicts through\ndialogue and the rejection of violence as the means to\nresolve internal or international disputes.\nOther examples of situations that cause\nunnecessary friction and that could be resolved through\ndialogue are the issues of the Saharan people\u2019s right to\nself-determination, the Argentine Republic\u2019s claim to\nthe Falkland Islands, and the representation of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations\nsystem while the internal situation of that fraternal\npeople is being resolved.\nPanama defends human rights without reservation\nand will never accept acts which violate them,\nwherever the violations occur and whatever the\ncircumstances used to try to justify those violations.\nLet us add to this very clear position of ours our\nsincere commitment to the universal campaign for the\nrights of the child and to the fight against HIV/AIDS,\nas these are an essential part of human rights. On this\nlatter issue, Panama considers that the key to any future\nsuccess lies in everyone\u2019s acceptance of their economic\nand social responsibilities with respect to this terrible\ndisease and in developing good community planning at\nthe local and provincial levels to prevent the spread of\nHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.\nHuman rights are clearly defined in the political\nand civil spheres as much as in the economic, social\nand cultural spheres. Since the proclamation of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10\nDecember 1948, much progress has been made.\nHowever, the principles proclaimed on that occasion\nare being challenged by the inequalities of\nglobalization and financing for development, by\nunpayable foreign debts and by the indiscriminate\ndestruction of the environment. All these factors of\nextreme poverty require acts of profound solidarity on\nbehalf of the richer nations. We firmly believe that the\neradication of poverty and inequality will prevent the\nerosion of human rights and halt the social upheavals\nthat generate violence and cause the loss of the\npolitical, social and economic rights of the citizens of\nthe world.\nThe United Nations Conference on Environment\nand Development, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992,\nwas a tremendous effort towards sustainable world\ndevelopment. The most important outcome of the\nConference was the adoption of Agenda 21, which\ncovers in depth the topics of poverty, hunger, disease,\nilliteracy and the progressive deterioration of\necosystems. Agenda 21 also encourages us to focus our\nattention on the financial resources required to promote\nsustainable development at the national level, with the\ngoal of creating a corresponding measurement system\nfor it that can be easily interpreted. This is an ongoing\nand important task that we cannot neglect.\nThe United Nations Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment will be held in Monterrey, Mexico, in\nMarch 2002. We believe that the Conference offers a\nmagnificent opportunity to reduce the abyss between\nthe rich countries of the North and the poor countries\nof the South in both the practical and conceptual\naspects of this issue.\nIn the course of last month\u2019s meetings of the\nConference\u2019s Preparatory Committee, opinions with\nsubstantial differences were expressed, and these must\nbe reconciled. As a result of these disagreements, there\nhave been pessimistic predictions that it will be\nimpossible to formulate a plan of action at Monterrey. I\nbelieve, on the contrary, that since we already know the\nobjections that will be made by those who assume the\n5\n\nrisks of financing, we cannot delay revising our\narguments, in order \u2014 creatively and responsibly \u2014 to\ndefine parameters for financing for development that\nare more in tune with the realities of today\u2019s world.\nThe current realities are pressing and encompass,\namong other things, the need to provide financing at\ndiscounted rates to developing countries; to vigorously\nattack the problem of foreign debt; to design measures\nto raise the depressed prices of our raw materials and\nother export products; and to agree collectively on\nmechanisms to prevent financial crises.\nFollowing this line of thought, and because we\nconsider it of interest to the General Assembly, we will\nmention that in June of this year the Central American\ncountries and the United States signed a joint\ndeclaration under the Alliance for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Central America (ALIDES). This\nalliance is a regional strategy to make the Central\nAmerican isthmus a region of peace, freedom,\ndemocracy and development. Its general objectives\ninclude the sustainable management of biodiversity, the\nstrengthening and modernization of institutional\nstructures, the promotion of trade and the mitigation of\nnatural disasters.\nSpecifically, ALIDES works for regional\neconomic integration and the region\u2019s integration in the\ninternational economy; the harmonization of\nmacroeconomic policies and the modernization of\ninfrastructure in the areas of energy, transportation and\ntelecommunications; the creation of protected\nbiological corridors, river basins and other areas; the\nstrengthening of democracy and the rule of law in the\nregion; the improvement of the levels of education,\nhealth and security of the population of Central\nAmerica; and the restoration and preservation of\nnational values.\nCentral America\u2019s desire for development has\nbeen strengthened by the launching of the Puebla-\nPanama Plan. We created for the region a mechanism\nfor ongoing and permanent consultation to perfect an\nintegral strategy for long-term development.\nWhile we are making great efforts to mitigate the\nsocial problems that afflict us in some regions, in the\nUnited Nations we continue to debate structural\nproblems that limit to some extent the ability of many\nof our countries to have an effect on the administration\nof the Organization. Among the different debates\nrelating to United Nations reform, we would like to\nrefer to the one held on 30 October on agenda item 49,\nentitled \u201cQuestion of equitable representation on and\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\nrelated matters\u201d. Last year the delegation of Panama,\nboth at the Millennium Summit and the General\nAssembly, supported the aspiration of many years to\nbring about the reform of the Security Council.\nWe have said \u2014 and we wish to repeat today \u2014\nthat we agree it must have a more equitable and more\nrepresentative composition, but in order to achieve this\nfundamental objective it is indispensable that the\npermanent members accept that the power structure of\n1945 has ceased to exist. Now, looking at the new and\nvital interdependence of all nations around the world,\nwe see a genuine opportunity opening before us to get\nrid of the obsessions that no longer suit the structure of\nour Organization.\nIn conclusion, we would like to restate our\nconviction that, as we have seen after the horrendous\nterrorist acts of 11 September, the legitimacy and\neffectiveness of future Security Council actions will\ndepend on all Member States feeling the absence of\nunilateral measures and of the usual marginalization in\ndecision-making on matters affecting all of us. It is in\nthis direction that we should guide our work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset, Sir, to convey to you\nour warmest congratulations on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. I am certain that your competence and\nactive cooperation with United Nations Member States\nwill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\nAllow me also to join previous speakers in\nexpressing our deep gratitude to your predecessor,\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his outstanding work and for the\nprofessional manner in which he presided over the\nfifty-fifth session of the Assembly.\nI should also like once again, on behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova, to reiterate\nour warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\nwhich was so well deserved, and for his re-election to\nanother term of office. His tireless efforts in redefining\nthe role of the United Nations in this changing world\nare certainly deeply appreciated and supported by my\nGovernment.\nThe barbaric terrorist attacks of 11 September\nhave radically changed the international security\nenvironment. Terrorism has become the most serious\nand immediate threat to the security and stability of our\nStates. A challenge was laid down, not only to the\nUnited States of America, but to the entire world\ncommunity. We fully agree with the statement made by\nthe President of the United States, Mr. George Bush, in\nhis statement before this Assembly at the 44th plenary\nmeeting, that \u201cthat threat cannot be ignored\u201d and that\n\u201ccivilization itself \u2014 the civilization we share \u2014 is\nthreatened\u201d.\nThe fight against international terrorism has\nclearly become a priority for the United Nations. Today\nwe see a strong international coalition emerging which,\nin the short term, is determined to bring to justice the\nperpetrators of terrorist acts and, in the long term, to\neliminate this evil from the face of the earth.\nThe Republic of Moldova, which immediately\naligned itself with the ranks of this coalition, strongly\ncondemned the indiscriminate large-scale terrorist\nattacks that took place in New York, Washington, D.C.,\nand Pennsylvania. Moldova has also unreservedly\nsupported the actions undertaken by the United States\nin its legitimate self-defence and in accordance with\nthe United Nations Charter and Security Council\nresolution 1368 (2001). Likewise, we support the\nglobal and multidimensional approach adopted by the\nUnited States in its war against terrorism.\nThe Republic of Moldova has demonstrated its\npolitical will to combat terrorist activities through\nconcerted efforts with other countries in the framework\nof various regional and subregional organizations.\n11\n\nOur Government has strengthened its counter-\nterrorism legislation in order to comply with relevant\nregional and United Nations conventions and with the\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nOur country is also taking measures in order to speed\nup accession to most of the remaining specialized\nUnited Nations counter-terrorism conventions. This\nmorning, I signed on behalf of my country the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism.\nThe tragic events of 11 September have shown\nthat the international community must take further\nsteps to resolve the longstanding international\nproblems on which terrorism and violence feed. We\nmust urgently address the conflicts around the world\nand eliminate their root causes and factors that can\nnurture the development of terrorism.\nI feel obliged to add my voice to those who see\nthe phenomenon of separatism as a root cause of\nconflicts and a threat to international peace and\nsecurity. In a globalized and interdependent world,\nseparatism affects the bases of multicultural societies\nand poses grave danger to the sovereignty and integrity\nof States. Like international terrorism, separatism\nemphasizes what divides rather than what unites us. As\na country affected by separatism for many years, we\nhave constantly noted this phenomenon and the\nconnections it sometimes has with other serious\ncriminal activities, including sometimes terrorism. This\nis why, in our opinion, this issue, among others, must\nbe taken into account by the United Nations Member\nStates in their efforts to elaborate and implement a\ncomprehensive and efficient counter-terrorism strategy.\nThe fact that I am focusing on the issues of\nconflict settlement and separatism is not accidental.\nOver the years, my delegation has informed the\nAssembly of the efforts being made to resolve the\nconflict in the Transdniestrian region of the Republic\nof Moldova. However, I am obliged to note with regret\nthe lack of any noticeable positive developments\ntowards a comprehensive settlement. Despite the\nreasonable compromises on the part of the\nconstitutional authorities in my country, the separatist\nregime continues to completely oppose any proposals\nto grant special status to the region as a constituent part\nof the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, the leaders of\nthat region have given a unilateral interpretation to\npolitical documents worked out with the active\nmediation of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine and the\nRussian Federation.\nAnother matter of continuing concern is the fact\nthat in recent years the illegal production of different\ntypes of armaments has been noted in this region.\nThese armaments have reached other conflict zones\nthrough third countries, supporting terrorists, criminal\ngroups and secessionist movements.\nWe should like to state once again that a complete\nand unconditional withdrawal of troops, munitions and\narmaments, as stipulated in the Istanbul OSCE Summit\ndocuments, would undoubtedly facilitate the peaceful\nand lasting settlement of this conflict.\nIn this connection, I would like to emphasize that\nmy Government encourages the recent efforts of the\nRussian Federation to cut back on its weapons\ndeployed in the Transdniestrian region of the Republic\nof Moldova, in accordance with the Treaty on\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Given the\nconsiderable progress that has been already made, we\ncertainly hope that the process of destruction and\nremoval of the weaponry will be completed before the\nBucharest OSCE ministerial meeting this December. I\nwould like also to express our gratitude to those\nMembers of the United Nations that have contributed\nfinancially to the OSCE voluntary fund established in\naccordance with the Istanbul decisions.\nThe role of the United Nations in international\npeace and security remains an essential part of its\nglobal responsibilities. The Republic of Moldova\nreiterates its conviction that the best strategy for\nmaintaining international peace and security is to\neliminate the root causes of conflicts. In this regard, we\nfully support the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to move\ninto a culture of conflict prevention.\nThe submission of periodic regional reports to the\nSecurity Council on disputes of various types that may\npotentially threaten international peace and security is\nanother important and necessary measure. The unequal\nattention given by the international system to different\nconflicts is still a matter of great concern. In order to\nbe successful, preventive strategies must reach all\nregions in crisis.\nThe credibility of the United Nations is called\ninto question whenever decisions mandating action in a\nparticular crisis are not matched by timely deployment\nof peacekeeping forces. Experience in recent years has\n12\n\nshown that the United Nations capacity to meet an\nexpanding and increasingly complex range of\npeacekeeping demands needs significant improvement.\nWe are pleased to note that action has been taken to\nimplement a number of practical measures proposed by\nthe Secretary-General in his second report on the\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Brahimi\nreport on peace operations.\nMoldova has already established the legislation\nand institutional framework for its future participation\nin the peacekeeping operations. I should also like to\nexpress the readiness of the Republic of Moldova to\nparticipate in the stand-by system, for which the\ninstitutional and technical preparations are currently in\ntheir concluding stage.\nAs we seek to enhance the United Nations\ncapacity in conflict prevention and peacekeeping, we\nmust also strengthen international cooperation for the\npromotion of sustainable development and the\nelimination of poverty worldwide. Development and\npoverty elimination are issues of tremendous\nimportance to many Member States, including my own.\nOur economic development has been gravely affected\nby the illegal actions of separatists, as well by the\nnegative consequences of globalization. These issues\nhave been considered very important by our leaders at\nthe Millennium Summit.\nSince the beginning of this year the world\neconomy has experienced a certain slowdown. In the\naftermath of the incidents of 11 September, this\ntendency has been exacerbated. The Millennium\nDeclaration recognized that the problems of both\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\ntransition have become even more acute, even tragic in\nrecent months, as a result of globalization. We hope\nthat developed countries will increase their support for\nus in dealing with our problems by granting greater\nassistance for development. Debt cancellation would\nplay a significant role in allowing us to free up\nfinancial resources and redirect them towards\nstimulating our economies.\nIn meeting the challenges of globalization, the\nUnited Nations plays an indispensable role in\ninternational cooperation. We welcome its greater\nparticipation in development issues and in facing the\ntasks set out in the Millennium Declaration. These\ngoals cannot be reached without significant financial\nsupport. The International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment to be held next year offer a unique\nopportunity to find the resources required to meet those\ngoals. We hope that the outcome of these two\nsignificant international events will be successful in\nthis regard.\nThe Republic of Moldova remains open to all\nforms of cooperation and is willing to contribute, as\nmuch as possible, to reaching the common goals of\nsustainable development and economic stability. We\nconsider that a comprehensive approach, based on the\nexperience of other States and on the specific cultural\ncharacter of a given country or region, will help us\nidentify and apply the best strategy for sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIn order for the United Nations to remain relevant\nand credible, it must maintain a strong commitment to\nthe continuing programme of reform and renewal. The\nreforms that have been undertaken and implemented in\nrecent years have already done much to strengthen and\nrevitalize the Organization. However, much remains to\nbe done and, in particular, we need to intensify our\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\nSecurity Council. The Republic of Moldova believes\nthat this reform should be guided by principles of\nequitable geographic representation, democracy,\neffectiveness, efficiency and transparency. It is on this\nbasis that we will be able to modernize the Security\nCouncil and bring it into line with the substantial\nincrease in the general membership of the United\nNations.\nIn this context I would like once again to reiterate\nthe position of my country with respect to the\nenlargement of the Security Council in both permanent\nand non-permanent categories: the Eastern European\nGroup should be given one additional non-permanent\nmembership seat.\nOur country welcomes the process of\nrevitalization and improvement of the General\nAssembly and, at the same time, supports efforts to\nrestore the central role of the Assembly as a main\nrepresentative body for debate at the United Nations.\nThis year the Republic of Moldova is celebrating\nthe tenth anniversary of its independence. During these\n10 years as a Member State of the United Nations, we\nhave fully shared the common values of the\nOrganization. We have achieved many significant\nresults in our internal development; much remains to\n13\n\nbe done, however. We have nonetheless laid down the\nfoundations of a democratic society. This was not an\neasy task, but we have made progress. The most\nimportant achievement has been that we have laid\ndown the foundations of a democratic society, with\nbasic human rights and the rights of national minorities\nbeing respected. The main achievement has been the\nconsolidation of the Republic of Moldova as a peace-\nloving independent European country.\nThe dramatic change of the situation in the\ninternational arena in the aftermath of the tragic events\nof 11 September calls for a new vision and a\nredefinition of the specific mechanisms for realizing\nthe fundamental objectives of the Organization, which\nspring essentially from the founding philosophy of the\nCharter of the United Nations. In this respect, the\nOrganization should draw conclusions from its own\npast and, relying on permanent support from its\nMember States, accomplish new tasks in the light of\nthe imperatives of the time. I join in expressing the\nhope that the proceedings of the General Assembly \u2014\nwhich are absolutely necessary for the international\ncommunity in the twenty-first century \u2014 will also\nmake it possible to ensure that this process moves in a\npositive direction.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, on\nbehalf of the Government of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan, and on my own behalf, I wish to express\nmy profound condolences to the Government of the\nUnited States of America and the American nation, as\nwell as the families that lost their loved ones in the\nunfortunate crash of American Airlines flight 857\nyesterday.\nMy delegation is very much delighted at Mr. Han\nSeung-soo\u2019s assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly and remains\nassured that his able conduct will lead the work of this\nsession to its desired end.\nMy delegation is also very pleased at Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan\u2019s meritorious winning of the\nNoble Peace Prize this year, I wish to warmly\ncongratulate him and his fellow recipient of the prize,\nthe United Nations itself.\nI am very thankful to all delegations that have\nmentioned the name and the case of Afghanistan and\nthe need for international help to reach Afghanistan.\nThe appalling events of 11 September and the\nsomewhat lesser-known event of 9 September \u2014 the\n33\n\nassassination by suicidal killers of the great Afghan\nleader Ahmad Shah Massoud \u2014 have changed the\nworld. The United Nations, the international\ncommunity and the world at large are focusing on a\nnew war, the war on terrorism. My Government and the\npeople of Afghanistan denounced the terrorist attacks\nagainst the United States and continue to denounce\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We\nourselves have been captives and hostages of terrorism\nlonger than most. In fact, during 23 years of war in\nAfghanistan, Muslim Afghans have not engaged in any\nterrorist acts. Islam is an integral part of life in\nAfghanistan and teaches justice and respect for human\nlife and glorifies the dignity of human beings.\nI quote from the Holy Koran: \u201cWe have bestowed\ndignity on the children of Adam\u201d. (The Holy Koran,\nXVII:70)\nIslam, in the tradition of the Abrahamic faiths,\nplaces great emphasis on peace, compassion and the\nvalue of human life. Thus, Islam should be recognized\nfor the principles upon which it was created and not\nacts resulting from irresponsible interpretations, which\nare far from genuine Islam. These irresponsible\ninterpretations are based on primitive and sectarian\nthinking, especially the retrogressive policies against\nwomen, which have no place in Islam.\nWith the strong, broad global coalition on their\nside, today the people of Afghanistan have been\nvindicated in their righteous struggle against terrorism\nand extremism \u2014 a struggle pursued single-handedly\nbut valiantly over the past seven years against the\nterrorist forces of the Taliban mercenaries and their\ncross-border and international allies, chief among them\nsince 1996 being Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda terrorist\norganization.\nIn this most trying time, when the people of\nAfghanistan are being liberated from the rule of the\nTaliban, and when Taliban forces are fleeing strategic\ncities across our land, including the capital, Kabul, it is\nevident that the civilian inhabitants of these cities and\nthe people of Afghanistan as a whole, having offered\ntheir support to the liberating forces of the Islamic\nState of Afghanistan\u2019s United Front, are deserving in\nthe fullest measure of a Government to which their\nwelfare can be soundly entrusted.\nOn Tuesday, 13 November, in a series of events\nrapidly taking shape in and around Kabul, the Taliban\nmercenaries and their terrorist allies were thought to be\nholding ground, but abandoned the city in a hasty\nmanner, causing a power vacuum.\nWith the capital, Kabul, on the verge of chaos and\nmayhem, the Government forces were left with no\noption but to dispatch a limited police force to the city.\nThe decision to police the city preceded eyewitness\nreports of the looting of National Bank assets and the\nplundering of the city\u2019s main currency market and a\nnumber of aid agencies by the retreating Taliban forces.\nWe deeply regret any ill treatment of individuals\nthat may have occurred in isolated cases. We have\nordered our security authorities not only to refrain from\nbut to actively investigate any such acts that may have\nbeen committed and to prevent such incidents from\ntaking place in the future. Let me reiterate that our\ndesire for peace for all people in our land remains firm\nand that we will not, now or later, condone any lawless\nacts aimed at disrupting the crucial process of\ninstituting a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully\nrepresentative Government in Afghanistan, as called\nfor by the United Nations and the entire international\ncommunity.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan hails the new\ndevelopments as a victory not only for the people of\nAfghanistan but also for the international community in\nour shared campaign against terrorism.\nLet me assure the Assembly that the recent\ngaining of ground by the forces of the Islamic State of\nAfghanistan\u2019s United Front in Kabul in no way reflects\nan intention on the part of the Government of the\nIslamic State of Afghanistan to monopolize power.\nRather, it is our sincere hope that the people of\nAfghanistan will decide democratically in the near\nfuture what form of political system they desire. In this\ncontext, we steadfastly support United Nations\nresolutions on Afghanistan, and thereby the\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General\u2019s\nspecial envoys to Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar\nBrahimi and Ambassador Francesc Vendrell, and will\ndo our utmost for the implementation of the process.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan fully honours its\nagreement made in Rome with the representatives of\nthe Rome process, led by the former King of\nAfghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah, and remains\ncommitted to its implementation.\nToday Afghanistan finds itself in a major\nhumanitarian crisis \u2014 a crisis such as the world has not\n34\n\nwitnessed in recent times. With winter approaching our\npeople are facing famine. Our people will die because\nthey do not have enough food to sustain them through\nthe winter. Many aid agencies began leaving\nAfghanistan after it became evident that the bombing\ncampaign would begin.\nOver the past several years, tens of thousands of\ncivilians have either fled the country or have been\ninternally displaced. The people of Afghanistan are not\nasking for a favour. They desire first and foremost to\nreturn to the position they were in before 1978 \u2014 a\nlevel playing field where they can govern themselves\nand grow. Twenty million landmines, a ruined and\nalmost non-existent infrastructure and a very high\nilliteracy rate do not make for a level playing field.\nEven a fraction of the benefits bestowed on the\ninternational community by Afghan sacrifices can\nreconstruct our nation.\nToday we are charged with finding a solution for\nAfghanistan, even as problems continue to increase and\nchange on a day-to-day basis. But we must now, not\nlater, think about the people of Afghanistan and about\ngiving them peace after so many years of war.\nA broad-based Government, inter alia, through\nthe Loya Jirga \u2014 Grand Assembly \u2014 must be\nestablished. All ethnic groups must be equitably and\nadequately represented and given voice in this broad-\nbased Government. The Hazaras, Pashtuns, Tajiks,\nUzbeks, Aimaks, Turkmen, Baluchis and all other\nethnic groups of Afghanistan must have fair\nrepresentation in this broad-based Government.\nAll these groups make up what Afghanistan is\ntoday, and Afghanistan is not complete without any of\nthese groups. For centuries, all of these groups have\nlived peacefully among themselves without bloodshed,\nand each one has contributed to Afghanistan and has\nsacrificed tremendously in the resistance against\nrepeated foreign occupations. For centuries, all these\ngroups, as a united people, resisted foreign hegemonic\nforces. History has shown that Afghanistan is not for\nforeign occupation or conquest.\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan\u2019s United Front\nwants the rule of law based on Islamic tenets,\npluralistic democracy, fundamental human rights,\npeace, unification and meaningful reconstruction. At\nour core we wish to uphold human rights for all\npeoples of our land \u2014 men and women. We desire to\nabide by United Nations resolutions, the rule of law\nand recognized international norms and principles. We\nhighly appreciate the efforts being made by the United\nNations aimed at finding a solution for Afghanistan\nand support all United Nations endeavours and\nmeasures to combat international terrorism.\nThe future Government of Afghanistan must not\nbe subjected any more to the unilateralism that has\nblanketed it for so long. The nation of Afghanistan\nmust have, as any nation must have, the respect of and\nsincere cooperation with its neighbours. The future\nGovernment of Afghanistan must not be reduced to a\n\u201csphere of influence\u201d; it must be recognized as a\nsovereign nation in the truest sense. Self-determination\nfor Afghanistan means that no country of the world\nshould have a veto concerning what the Afghans decide\nfor themselves.\nRecognition of the principles of mutual respect,\nnon-interference and full sovereignty of Afghanistan\nwill naturally be followed by economic and\ncommercial cooperation. Hence, a sovereign\nAfghanistan will deploy all efforts to broaden its\nrelations with all of its neighbours, including Pakistan.\nSuch measures as opening up to Pakistan and opening\nup key transit routes, from north to south and from east\nto west, ought to be implemented. Afghanistan has to\nbroaden its economic relations with all neighbouring\ncountries. The crossroads at the heart of Asia is\nsituated in Afghanistan, and our country\u2019s economic\nand international development rests largely in utilizing\nthis resource in a progressive and open manner.\nI need not remind Members today that a stable\nAfghanistan means a stable Pakistan and a stable\nCentral Asia. An ignored and ruined Afghanistan\nwould be a calamity for the entire region and the whole\nworld.\nThe people of Afghanistan must decide what\nform of Government they desire. No one ethnic group\nmust dominate and no neighbour of Afghanistan has\nthe right to incite, overtly or covertly, one ethnic group\nagainst others. It is time for the people of Afghanistan\nto think about their future and to come together. They\nmust all work together for their country as they have\nworked for centuries before. It is my aspiration and the\naspiration of every Afghan that normalcy will be\nrestored and that we will live in peace.\nWe, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and we, the\nUnited Nations and the international community, have\na duty to rebuild Afghanistan. There must be an\n35\n\nextensive and comprehensive United Nations-led\nreconstruction plan for Afghanistan. The international\ncommunity must take the reconstruction of Afghanistan\nas seriously as it takes the war on terrorism. I submit\nthat reconstruction and a people\u2019s hope will do more to\neradicate evils such as terrorism and the seeds of\nterrorism than war can perhaps ever do.\nRehabilitation must begin with addressing\nhumanitarian problems, including the pressing crisis of\ninternally displaced persons and refugees. The longer-\nterm Afghan reconstruction programme must be\ncomprehensive; under such a programme, facilities of\nall kinds \u2014 roads, bridges, hospitals and schools and\nuniversities for boys and girls \u2014 must be\nreconstructed. Girls were purposely made illiterate by\nthe Taliban mercenaries. A massive education effort\nmust be undertaken so that our young people can learn\nskills and grow up to be a new generation for our\ncountry. The 20 million landmines must be cleared so\nthat the people can cultivate their land and not have to\nrely only on poppies to make a living.\nIn the Afghan reconstruction programme there\nmust be a programme for orphans and widows. The\nAfghan reconstruction programme must directly help\nthe war-stricken and war-devastated land and people of\nAfghanistan. Afghans of the diaspora, from all over the\nworld, must come and take part in the Afghan\nreconstruction programme and help build their country.\nI believe that, with the help of almighty God, we\ncan rebuild Afghanistan and that Afghanistan can once\nagain live in peace with its neighbours and can\ncontribute to the prosperity of the international\ncommunity.\nIn conclusion, I appeal to the United Nations and\nto the international community to adopt a new vision\nfor Afghanistan, a vision that will leave behind the\ndeath and destruction that has seized its people for so\nmany years, a vision that embraces tolerance and unity,\na vision that will rebuild the spirit of Afghanistan and\ngive hope for peace to each and every person of our\nland. The change must come from each person who\ncalls himself a Muslim and an Afghan; it must also\ncome from each country that calls itself a friend of\nAfghanistan. Our friends and neighbours must grant us\nthe goodwill to govern ourselves and to be our own\npeople.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are confident that your\nexperience and knowledge will expedite the work of\nthe General Assembly most effectively.\nTurkmenistan is participating in the work of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly for the tenth time as\nan independent entity in international relations and for\nthe sixth time as a State whose status of neutrality has\nbeen recognized by the community of nations. Since\nthe adoption of the General Assembly resolution 50/80\non the Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan, which is\nof historic significance for us, our young State has\nconsistently witnessed the support of the United\nNations in striving for peace and in our foreign policy\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening peace, security and\nstability. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would\nlike to convey to the heads of delegations present here\nand to the representatives of the member States of the\nUnited Nations the words of gratitude from President\nNiyazov and assure you of Turkmenistan\u2019s unswerving\ncommitment to its international obligations as a\npermanently neutral State.\nRelations with the United Nations, based on close\ncooperation and strict observance of the fundamental\nprinciples of the Organization, have been and remain at\nthe fore of Turkmenistan\u2019s foreign policy strategy. For\nus, the United Nations is the main and universal\ndecision-making entity for the most crucial problems of\nglobal development. We share the view of the\nOrganization itself that providing it with a new impetus\nin view of the rapidly changing realities of today\u2019s\nworld is of the utmost relevance. In our view the main\naspect of this new drive is respect for the overall\nbalance of interests on the basis of the fundamental\ncriteria underpinning the functioning of the\nOrganization, its ideals, the letter and the spirit of the\nUnited Nations Charter. It is our firm belief that the\nUnited Nations has proven over the years of its\nexistence that it represents the most effective and just\nmechanism for resolving international issues. It is the\nmainstay of the whole system of international stability\nand security.\nTurkmenistan has always stood for, and continues\nto stand for, the strengthening and expansion of the\nUnited Nations role in the world. In this connection,\nwe believe that international law and the United\nNations Charter, which is based on principles of peace,\nequality, respect for nations and for their rights and\nsovereignty and choosing their own way of\ndevelopment, continue to serve as the basis for the\nworld order in this new century. This belief reflects our\nprinciples as a neutral State, the entire philosophy of\nour country\u2019s foreign policy and our practice in this\ndecade-long participation in regional and international\naffairs.\nTurkmenistan attaches the utmost importance to\nits cooperation with the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies. Our Government and the United\nNations Development Programme jointly carry out a\nnumber of large-scale projects in the social and\neconomic spheres that have yielded good results for the\nenvironment and many other areas, including health,\neducation and ecology. Our cooperation with the\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the United\n38\n\nNations Population Fund and other agencies has been\nmost effective. Turkmenistan will continue to maintain\nclose ties with these important agencies of the United\nNations in the search for new avenues of cooperation.\nWe consider interaction with United Nations\nbodies and agencies to be an important and useful\ninstrument in our regional, economic, cultural and\ninformational cooperation, as well as in our joint\nefforts with the Governments of neighbouring countries\nto implement other international programmes of\nvarious types. All of this undoubtedly fosters\nneighbourly relations and partnership ties in the region.\nTherefore, our country intends to focus in the future on\nmaintaining the closest possible contact with the\noffices of United Nations specialized agencies, whose\nimportance continues to grow.\nAlong these lines, I should like to draw particular\nattention to the situation that has emerged in our region\nsince the tragic events of 11 September in the United\nStates. It was with tremendous grief that the people of\nTurkmenistan heard the news from America. The\nPresident of Turkmenistan, on behalf of the people of\nour country, expressed sincere condolences to the\nfamilies and relatives of victims, and he addressed\nwords of consolation and compassion to all Americans.\nThese acts of terror have been unconditionally\ncondemned in our country. The Government of\nTurkmenistan was one of the first to make a statement\nin support of international efforts to combat terrorism\neffectively. Turkmenistan recommended uniting such\nefforts under the auspices of the United Nations.\nAction needs to be closely coordinated by the members\nof the international community on the basis of\ninternational law, ensuring that no manifestation of\nterrorism in this world will go unpunished and making\npossible effective and legitimate measures to combat\nthis evil.\nGiven what has happened, our country has\ncooperated actively with the United Nations in\nproviding transportation through Turkmenistan for\nhumanitarian supplies being sent to Afghanistan by\nUnited Nations specialized humanitarian relief\nagencies, including UNICEF, the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees and the World Food\nProgramme, as well as other governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations. Turkmenistan\u2019s\nconstructive position has received general support from\nthe United Nations and the majority of States in the\nworld.\nWe are greatly concerned over the situation in\nAfghanistan and the ongoing armed conflict in that\ncountry, which affects stability as well as social and\neconomic development in the region. Turkmenistan\nshares the view that there is no alternative to a peaceful\nresolution of the Afghanistan question through\nnegotiations. That is why we are convinced that the\nroad to peace in this long-suffering country lies in\npolitical negotiations under the auspices of the United\nNations. In this respect, we greatly appreciate the\nefforts of the Secretary-General to enhance the role of\nthe United Nations in finding a solution to the Afghan\ncrisis, because it is precisely the United Nations that\nmust play a role in working out international legal\nmechanisms to resolve the situation in Afghanistan.\nAs to the implementation of a strategy for\npeaceful development and cooperation in the region, I\nwould like to stress that the foreign policy of neutrality\npursued by Turkmenistan from the beginning follows\nprecisely this path. This point also touches on the\nquestion of exploiting the valuable hydrocarbon\ndeposits of the Caspian Sea Basin, which involves not\nonly regional interests but also the interests of many\nother nations of the world as well as those of trans-\nnational companies. It is our policy to take those\ninterests into account.\nNaturally, the oil and natural gas deposits in the\nCaspian Sea are extremely important energy resources\nfor the twenty-first century. Their rational and effective\nexploitation, and the construction of an appropriate\npipeline infrastructure to deliver these energy supplies\nto world markets, will ensure considerable economic\ngrowth for many States and the welfare of their people.\nThe United Nations can play an important role in this\nprocess, as it is capable of creating a mechanism to\nguarantee the safe and unimpeded transportation of\nsuch raw materials along inter-State pipelines. As the\nAssembly will recall, Turkmenistan put forward this\nidea at the Millennium Summit and suggested that an\ninternational convention should be worked out in this\nregard.\nEffective economic activity in the Caspian is\ninherently linked to ensuring stability in the Caspian\nregion. Turkmenistan believes that the Caspian Sea\narea should be a zone of peace, stability and sustained\n39\n\ninternational cooperation based on the principles of\njustice and mutual respect.\nIt is clear that the problems now faced by\nMember States of the United Nations are complex and\nmanifold. Their solution is possible not only through\ncollective efforts but also through the necessary\nrecognition of the individual role and responsibility of\neach nation as a member of the world community. It is\nthis logic of political behaviour that Turkmenistan has\nin mind when it limits itself to the goals of\nstrengthening peace and promoting economic, social\nand cultural development. Our country is always ready\nfor constructive partnership, and the United Nations\nknows that it can always rely on Turkmenistan."

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, I should like to express our very sincere\ncondolences and sense of compassion to the families of\nthe victims of the tragic accident that occurred this\nmorning, as well as to the authorities of the City and\nState of New York, which have been so seriously\naffected by the terrorist attacks on 11 September.\nI should, however, like to congratulate our\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo. I am convinced that\nwith the cooperation of Member States, he will be able\nto conduct this Assembly in a way to ensure that it\nresponds ambitiously and effectively to the challenges\nbefore it.\nPresident Holkeri conducted the Millennium\nAssembly deftly, wisely exercising his presidential\nauthority and evincing a soothing sense of humour. We\nwould like to thank him for that.\nOur Secretary-General tirelessly continues his\nwork to promote international peace and security.\nMember States wish to thank him for the imagination\nand wisdom shown as he discharges his lofty\nresponsibility, and they have renewed his term of\noffice. International public opinion has expressed its\ngratitude for his exceptional commitment by giving\nhim, together with the United Nations, the Nobel Peace\nPrize. We would like to associate ourselves with that\ntribute. We congratulate him and wish him the best in\nhis difficult work at the head of the Organization.\nIn the course of this first session of the twenty-\nfirst century, the General Assembly has begun its work\nunder the sign of terrorism. The indescribable crime\nthat was committed on 11 September 2001 against the\nUnited States of America and its citizens, male and\nfemale, represents a breakdown in international\nrelations. It was not only America that was targeted by\nthis infamous attack against the World Trade Center\ntowers  it was our lifestyle in an open, democratic,\ntolerant and multicultural society to which the broad\nmajority of countries and peoples represented here\naspire. That is unbearable to terrorists.\n17\n\nCivilian airplanes have become guided missiles\nthrough blind and murderous terrorism, and as a result\nwe all feel attacked. We can't call this a confrontation\nhere between civilizations, combat between North and\nSouth, between religions. The perpetrators of the\nrepugnant attack of 11 September wish to deny by their\nact the very values that form the basis of the\ninternational community, which we have endeavoured\nto build for the past 50 years through the United\nNations and its multilateral system.\nThe subsequent discussion in public opinion has\nshown that our societies do not yet know each other\nwell enough. Ignorance leads to distrust and even\nhostility, promoting a chilling self-absorption.\nDialogue among civilizations, as promoted and\npractised by our Organization, must now more than\never be at the forefront of our considerations.\nHaving expressed its compassion for the innocent\nvictims of those cowardly attacks, the international\ncommunity must now react with determination to\nensure that the perpetrators receive the punishment\nthey deserve and to defend itself in such a way as to\nprevent such acts in the future. I should like to take this\nopportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the United\nStates of America in its exercise of its legitimate right\nto self-defence.\nTwo days ago, the current President of the\nEuropean Union, Mr. Louis Michel, gave a detailed\ndescription of the measures and initiatives taken by the\n15 member States to combat the scourge of terrorism.\nLuxembourg is participating unreservedly in this joint\neffort.\nOnly through coordinated and interdisciplinary\nwork will we be able to fight all forms of terrorism.\nOur response must be commensurate with the threat,\nwhile respecting the fundamental freedoms of the\ncitizen  a principle that underlies our civilization.\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, we\nmust work under the auspices of the United Nations\nwith a view to promoting the emergence of a stable and\nlegitimate Government that is representative of the\nAfghan population as a whole. Such a Government\nmust respect the human rights of the Afghan people\nand develop good-neighbourly relations with all the\ncountries of the region. In that context, I should like to\nwelcome in particular the activities of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\nAfghanistan, Mr. Brahimi.\nAs soon as its objective has been achieved, the\ninternational community, through the concerted efforts\nof the United Nations, the International Committee of\nthe Red Cross and other international organizations,\nshould set up an ambitious programme that is both\npolitical and humanitarian, with a view to helping to\nreconstruct Afghanistan and to ensure its integration\nwithin a stabilized region. Such an effort will require\nintensified political dialogue with all of the countries\nof the region.\nAt this time, the provision of assistance to the\ncivilian population in Afghanistan and to the refugees\nacross its borders is a matter of priority. My country\nhas already raised almost 7 million euros for that\npurpose as part of a comprehensive effort within the\nEuropean Union amounting to more than 320 million\neuros.\nAlthough there are no grounds for making a\ndirect connection between the events of 11 September\nand the situation in the Middle East, the situation there\nis becoming increasingly worrying. We note that,\nunfortunately, the fabric that was woven during 10\nyears of mediation efforts and that was almost\ncompleted at Taba is now unravelling before our eyes.\nDuring my recent visit to the region, I noted the extent\nto which the peace process, which has been deadlocked\nfor far too long, is suffering from the absence of any\nreal prospects and from increasing distrust among the\nparties.\nThat is why, together with our colleagues from\nthe European Union, we are stepping up our efforts to\nconvince the parties that only the cessation of violence\nand the recognition of two States will make it possible\nfor negotiations to resume that can lead to a just and\nlasting peace in the region, on the basis of the\nestablishment of a Palestinian State and the right of\nIsrael to live in peace and security. The European\nUnion stands ready to provide a framework for this\nprocess, in cooperation with the United States of\nAmerica and the Arab States of the region, and to assist\nthe parties with a view to facilitating the reconciliation\nthat is necessary.\nIn the meantime, the United Nations will\ntirelessly pursue its efforts to achieve international\npeace and stability. In 2001, four reports of the\nSecretary-General  dealing with peacekeeping,\nhumanitarian action, the prevention of conflict and the\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit  have shown\n18\n\nthe way forward. They show that it is necessary for the\ninternational community to be steadfast in its\ncommitment to the prevention and management of\nconflict.\nAny hesitation or fleeting expression of\ndisinterest might risk encouraging elements that may\nwant to aggressively defend their own interests without\nregard for the consequences at the national or\ninternational level. Europe has witnessed such dramatic\nchains of events, particularly in the Balkans, and we\ncan only feel a sense of humility when considering\ntheir disastrous effects.\nIf this year the United Nations has not been on\nthe front line in the Balkans, it has been working hard\nin the area of peacekeeping. I would like to make two\ncomments about these operations. First, we note that\nthere has been a considerable improvement in the\nquality of their management, following the conclusions\nof the Brahimi report. Secondly, there has been an\ninternational commitment to deal with hotbeds of\ntension as diverse and complex as those of Kosovo,\nEast Timor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nSierra Leone.\nThe balance sheet is relatively encouraging.\nKosovo will soon be holding elections that will have\nimportant consequences for the future of the province.\nThe United Nations operation in East Timor can,\nperhaps, be viewed as a clear success for international\naction. Attempts to restructure peacekeeping operations\nhave been promoted through careful consideration in\nthe Secretariat, the Security Council and the General\nAssembly, based upon an outstanding follow-up report.\nThe complexity of crisis situations often, of\ncourse, demands a prudent response, even when real\nprogress has been made, as is the case in Sierra Leone.\nIt is even more important to document international\ndetermination through clear mandates that allow for a\nstrong response. We believe that the inclusion of troop-\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process\nis essential. The increasingly integrated approach that\nhas been chosen, as illustrated by the United Nations\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\nTimor, is designed to ensure a logical succession\nbetween the phases of prevention, peacekeeping and,\nfinally, consolidation, reconstruction and development.\nOne of the most urgent tasks of our Organization\nis to provide immediate assistance for civilian\npopulations that are the victims of natural disasters or\ncrises brought about by human intervention.\nLuxembourg attaches particular importance to such\nneeds, and we are endeavouring to support United\nNations offices in this physically and morally\ndemanding task. Since the fall of 2000, we have been\ncoordinating, on an informal basis, the donor countries\nin New York, and our delegation takes pleasure in\nnoting the dedication of the competent officials and\nauthorities who head these services. I would like to\nassure the Assembly that my country is clearly aware\nof the need to protect, and ensure the safety of,\npersonnel.\nHumanitarian action, prevention, ceasefire\nagreements and peace-building activities hardly\nconstitute the entire agenda of the international\ncommunity. A functioning democracy is a major asset\nin progress towards development, as I have already\nemphasized. I need only reaffirm the importance of\nnational efforts to combat corruption and foster the\nestablishment, within our societies, of the rule of law\nbased on an equitable and properly functioning legal\nsystem.\nMy country welcomes the efforts under way\nwithin the United Nations to put an end to impunity\nand to ensure that those responsible for committing\ncrimes against humanity and other atrocities answer for\ntheir actions within an international criminal\njurisdiction.\nA special tribunal to judge crimes committed\nduring the course of the civil war is in the process of\nbeing established in Sierra Leone, and Luxembourg has\nmade a financial contribution to its establishment. In\nCambodia, a law to establish a tribunal to consider the\natrocities and genocide perpetrated under the\ndictatorship of the Khmer Rouge is now in force, and\nwe must assess its compatibility with the memorandum\nproposed by the United Nations. The Tribunals in The\nHague and Arusha have stepped up their work, and, for\nthe first time, a former head of State is awaiting his\ntrial in prison. We welcome these developments, as\nwell as those who have joined us in the group of\ncountries that have ratified the Rome Statute of the\nfuture International Criminal Court. The citizens of\nLuxembourg would be pleased to see that convention\nenter into force as soon as possible and acceded to by a\nbroad majority of States.\n19\n\nIn September 2000, heads of State and\nGovernment met here in New York. Since then, the\nMillennium Declaration has underpinned the actions of\nthe United Nations and of States at the national level.\nTogether with its European partners, Luxembourg has\naffirmed its dedication to the commitments entered into\nthere.\nI conclude by citing two facts that illustrate the\nawareness of my country's Government of the\nresponsibilities its shares with all here in preparing for\nthe future of coming generations. First, official\ndevelopment assistance from Luxembourg has reached\n0.71 per cent of our gross national product; the\nGovernment has decided to raise it to 1 per cent by\n2005. I have also submitted to my country's Chamber\nof Deputies Luxembourg's first nomination to serve as\na non-permanent member of the Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as\nPresident of this fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. My delegation pledges its support and\ncooperation to you and your country as you discharge\nyour important responsibilities.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\nto your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session. We are grateful to\nhim for the able and successful manner in which he\npresided over the session.\nI wish to salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, on his re-election to the helm of the United\nNations, which is an attestation of the commitment and\nthe dynamism with which he has guided the\nOrganization during this period of great challenge.\nI am addressing this session in my dual capacity\nas President of the Republic of Zambia and current\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\nThis occasion holds a special significance to me as I\nmake my last statement to the General Assembly as\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, having almost\ncome to the end of my second and last tenure of office\nof my country.\nThis year the general debate of the General\nAssembly is taking place in November instead of two\nmonths ago, because of the tragic events of 11\nSeptember. Those developments united us on the need\nto postpone this session, just as we were united in our\nresolve to fight international terrorism, which knows\nno boundaries. Indeed, today more than ever before,\nthe entire world seems more conscious of, and gripped\nby, the evil of international terrorism and the\nconsequent loss of life and destruction of property.\nTerrorism is an affront to humanity. It is a\nheinous and cowardly act that is hated almost as much\nas we hated apartheid or any form of racism. It is for\nthese reasons that Africa has for a long time been\nfighting international terrorism. In Algiers, Algeria, in\n1999, we, as African leaders, took a mammoth decision\nby adopting a Convention on the prevention and\ncombating of all forms of terrorism. Although the\nConvention has not entered into force, Africa has since\nthen been seeking international support in the adoption\nof appropriate strategies for the effective eradication of\nthe multiple root causes of terrorism. We remain\nresolute and resolutely committed to, and united in, the\npursuit of this goal.\nHowever, let me also hasten to add that, in spite\nof its gravity and magnitude, the threat of terrorism\nmust not override or deduct from the appropriate focus\non the outstanding matters on the global agenda.\nBurning issues such as the scourge of conflicts, poverty\neradication, the debt problem and the HIV/AIDS\npandemic, among other things, should continue to be\naccorded the necessary attention they so much deserve.\nWhile many good things and positive\ndevelopments have been taking place on the African\ncontinent, these are, nevertheless, largely\novershadowed by the many conflicts that continue to\nrage in a number of our countries. We have witnessed\nconflict in the Mano River basin involving Sierra\n15\n\nLeone, Liberia and Guinea; the situations in Sudan and\nSomalia are yet to be settled; disturbances recently\nerupted in the Comoros; and violence continues to\nthreaten the constitutionally elected Government in the\nCentral African Republic. The Great Lakes region\nremains a tinderbox, while the conflict in Angola has\nexperienced no movement towards resolution for quite\nsome time now. Meanwhile, the ceasefire agreement in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is yet to be fully\nimplemented.\nAfrica does not lack the political will or resolve\nto find solutions to these conflicts. Neither has Africa\nsat back and waited for the outside world to come and\nresolve these conflicts. Instead, Africa has\nacknowledged responsibility for these conflicts and has\nspearheaded efforts to bring peace wherever there have\nbeen conflicts.\nIt was Africa, through the efforts of President\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika, that brought about an end to the\nEthiopia-Eritrea conflict. The guns were silenced in\nLiberia and Sierra Leone, thanks to the efforts of the\nleaders of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS), who are still leading the effort to\nbring peace to the Mano River basin. The leaders of the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\nhave continued to seek peaceful settlements in Sudan\nand Somalia, while the Lusaka peace processes have\naddressed the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. Most recently, a Transitional\nGovernment of National Unity was inaugurated in\nBurundi on 1 November 2001, as a culmination of\nefforts started by the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and\ncompleted by Nelson Mandela, two of Africa\u2019s most\ndistinguished sons.\nIt is clear from the foregoing that what Africa\nneeds to successfully resolve the conflicts on the\ncontinent is the moral, practical and financial support\nof the international community. Africa has always\nbelieved in the dictum that in unity there is strength.\nWe believe that all nations belong to a common global\ncommunity with a shared destiny and shared\nresponsibilities.\nTo this end, Africa has always been ready and\nwilling to participate in efforts to restore peace where\npeace has broken down, irrespective of the location of\nthe region. Our men and women have served as\npeacekeepers in Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East\nbecause we believe that peace is indivisible.\nAfrica therefore expects that, just as we are ready\nand willing to serve in the promotion and defence of\npeace everywhere, so, too, should the international\ncommunity be willing to be full partners in the search\nfor peace in Africa.\nIn this regard, I cannot help but register our\ndisappointment that after the painstaking efforts by Sir\nKetumile Masire to organize the inter-Congolese\nnational dialogue in Addis Ababa on 15 October 2001,\nand notwithstanding the many pledges made to finance\nit, the dialogue could not take off due partly to\ninsufficient funds. I would therefore like to appeal to\nthe international community, through the Assembly, to\nprovide the necessary assistance to Sir Ketumile\nMasire, the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue,\nto enable him to proceed with organizing the dialogue\nand to conclude the peace process in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. In particular, I wish to make a\nspecial appeal to all those who have made pledges to\nthe facilitator to release these pledges urgently.\nConflicts do not stand alone or develop in a\nvacuum. Political conflicts and social tension are a\nresult of imbalances in the dispensation of political\npower, economic wealth and benefits, as well as of\nsocial suppression, segregation and the repression of\none or more groups of people on the basis of race,\nethnicity or even religion. The African continent, with\nbarely 40 years of independence, has suffered centuries\nof fractured development, deprivation of resources and\nthe political and social suppression of its people. These\nare the conditions at the centre of Africa\u2019s current\nstruggle to redress both the political and economic\nimbalances.\nThe United Nations World Conference against\nRacism, held in South Africa this year, took a major\nhistorical step by refocusing on that human injustice of\nthe past, whose consequences continue to ravage our\nsocieties to this day. The Conference condemned the\nslave trade, slavery, colonialism and apartheid as\ncrimes against humanity. The condemnation of past\ninjustices should be made on the premise that we now\nhave the will, the resolve and the commitment to\nembark upon the process of healing, reconciliation and\nredress. Our final objective is to bring about justice,\npolitical liberation, economic development and a fair\nsocial system that will promote the human rights of\nindividuals, the national sovereignty of States and\nmutually beneficial regional and global\ninterdependence and cooperation.\n16\n\nThe African economic and social condition has\nbeen on the agenda of the United Nations since\nAfrica\u2019s decade of independence. Slavery, colonialism\nand apartheid, and now pervasive poverty, misery and\nsqualor for the majority of our people continue to\nravage the continent with negative consequences for\nhuman life. The advent of HIV/AIDS, coupled with\ncenturies-old diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis\nand with many other communicable yet curable\ndiseases such as cholera, dysentery and diarrhoea, has\nreduced African life expectancy from 68 years to 50\nyears, and in some countries to only a pathetic 38\nyears. The mortality rate for children under the age of 5\nyears is 140 per 1,000 births on the average. Such\nadverse social conditions cannot be at all conducive to\neconomic development and improvement in the\nstandard of living. These conditions have to be changed\nfor the better.\nThe development process of post-colonial or\nindependent Africa has also accumulated debt and\nsuffered negative terms of trade for its raw materials\nand products exported to the developed countries. On\nthe one hand, the resulting huge trade deficits of\nAfrican nations reduce their purchasing power for the\ntechnology, equipment and investment capital they\nneed for economic growth and development. On the\nother hand, the deficit increases the foreign debt and\nshrinks public investment programmes for\ninfrastructure and education and health delivery\nsystems, thereby further suppressing the very\nconditions necessary for development and the\neradication of poverty.\nAfrica is not asking for charity! No. What Africa\nis asking for is more accessible conditions for its raw\nmaterials and products, and for prices that are fair and\nconducive to development. We are not asking for\ncharity. No. We are asking for more African countries\nto have access to the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Initiative (HIPC), so that they could use the\nfreed resources to build infrastructure such as schools,\ncombat diseases, provide safe drinking water and\ninvest in income-generating community activities\nbecause, eventually, these are the measures which will\nreduce poverty. We further call on the international\ncommunity to intensify and accelerate initiatives that\nshould bring debt cancellation to the poor countries.\nThere cannot be a credible solution to the problem of\npoverty in Africa without debt cancellation.\nThe continent of Africa has accepted and fully\nshares the responsibilities that come with globalization.\nAs a developing continent, we need to continue to\nreorganize ourselves to face the challenges of the time.\nThe thirty-seventh session of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment, held in Lusaka, Zambia, last July, took\nAfrica to a new historical stage when it launched the\nAfrican Union (AU). The AU will elevate Africa\u2019s\nintegration agenda by forging a more cohesive political\nunion, while also creating an economic community of\nnations. The Union also seeks to promote new levels of\npartnerships with the international community,\nparticularly in the areas of sustainable economic\ngrowth and development and of peace and security. At\nthe Lusaka Summit, the OAU also adopted a new\neconomic-centred recovery programme and poverty\nreduction strategy called the New African Initiative,\nwhich is now called the New Partnership for African\nDevelopment.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express Africa\u2019s\nappreciation to the Group of 8 which, at its meeting in\nGenoa, Italy, in July, endorsed the African initiative. I\nalso wish to thank the European Union, which, during\nour meeting last month in Brussels, pledged its full\nsupport of the initiative. It is important to note also that\nAfrica has been an active participant in global trade\nliberalization initiatives. We thank the Government of\nthe United States for the practical step it has taken\nthrough the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It is\na pioneering example in expanding trade and export\nopportunities for Africa and for development.\nDebt relief, debt cancellation, increased\nproduction, accessibility to export markets, better\nterms of trade and economic integration \u2014 these mark\nthe way forward to African development, sustainable\ngrowth and poverty reduction. Under economic growth\nand improved social conditions, democracy and good\ngovernance will be sustained and conflicts reduced and\nmanaged, while peace and security will last.\nThe time has come for me to thank the people of\nZambia for having given me the privilege and honour\nof serving in the distinguished capacity of President of\nthe Republic of Zambia, to thank my colleagues in\nAfrica for entrusting me with the chairmanship of the\nOAU and for their confidence and support and to thank\nall of you in the international community. I have tried\nmy best during my tenure of office and can therefore\nonly hope that I have lived and performed up to your\n17\n\nexpectations. Soon Zambia will have a new president.\nIt is my hope that he will be accorded the same support\nand cooperation you have so kindly given to me in the\nlast ten years.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I bring you greetings from the small and\nbeautiful country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nPlease accept our congratulations on your election as\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly. You are assured of my country\u2019s full support\nfor a successful session. We would also like to offer\nour heartfelt congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan on his election to a second term, and to the\nUnited Nations Organization and the Secretary-General\nfor the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize received in\nhonour of their efforts to ensure a better and more\npeaceful world. It is impossible to think of more\ndeserving recipients of this award as this coalition of\nnations and our beloved Secretary-General strive to\nensure that the Organization fulfils its mandate\naccording to the Charter.\nI commend the President of the United States of\nAmerica for the statesmanship and resolve with which\nhe continues to deal with the difficulties at hand. I also\nsalute the civic leaders of this great city of New York\nfor the institutional leadership during this problematic\ntime. The city has been visited by tragedy once again\nthis week. On behalf of the Government and people of\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, I offer sincere\ncondolences to all those touched by this latest disaster,\nnot least our neighbours and friends in the Dominican\nRepublic.\nOur Government stands firm with the\ninternational community on Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) against terrorism. We are\nworking closely with the Governments of the region,\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Latin\nAmerica and the United States in an effort to fight the\nscourge of terrorism. Our Government has tightened\nsecurity and implemented measures intended to close\nany possible avenue that criminals and terrorists may\nexploit. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure that\nbarbarism is defeated. Compliance with resolution\n1373 (2001) is difficult and expensive for small States\nwith limited means and technical expertise. But we will\ncomply.\nThe international community has mustered an\nimpressive effort to fight the plague of terrorism. In\nthis midst of this, however, we must not lose sight of\nthe fact that terrorism will not be eradicated by one\nvictory in one war. It behooves us as world leaders to\nlook deeper into the causes of violence and terror. It is\nthe firm belief of my Government that marginalization\nof the poor and underprivileged creates a hotbed for\nextremism and lawlessness.\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the\nwider Caribbean have triumphed over the evils of\nslavery and colonialism to emerge with a truly noble\ncivilization. We are a people made up of races from the\nfour corners of the earth who have melded into one\nbeautiful whole. We are democratic in our governance\nand tolerant in our attitudes. We are a hard-working,\nindustrious people. We are proud. It is not in our nature\nto seek alms from the rich. But, Mr. President, it is\nself-evident that an economy such as ours, which is\nalmost totally dependent on agriculture and tourism,\nneeds help if we are to survive and prosper.\nThe influence of the multinational Chiquita and\nDole banana companies has been working for years to\ndestroy the industry of our banana farmers. The World\nTrade Organization (WTO), of which we are a member,\nseems bent on widening the gulf between rich and poor.\nWe are not optimistic about the outcome of this week\u2019s\neconomic Ministerial Meeting in Doha. A farmer\nworking one or two acres of mountain land and eking\nout a living cannot compete with the giants who control\nthousands of acres in the Central American countries.\nMr. President, if you take away that which feeds\nus, you must offer something in return. That is why the\nupcoming conference in Mexico on financing for\ndevelopment is of seminal importance to the small and\ndeveloping countries of this world. It is time for the\neconomic giants of the world to stop paying lip service\nto the idea of financing for development and to put into\npractice real and workable means for the poor,\nunderprivileged and vulnerable nations to join the\nmainstream. We need the commercial barriers erected\nby those intent on maintaining their hegemony to be\nremoved. We adhere to the adage \u201cTrade, not Aid\u201d. But\nthis is not yet a realistic option and, in the present\nclimate, will not be for the foreseeable future. We hate\nasking for charity. We merely ask that promises be kept\nand commitments adhered to. As a small island\ndeveloping State, we need relief from the burden of our\nforeign debts, high interest rates and other unfair\ninternational trade constraints. We need the Bretton\nWoods institutions to perform their function in a\ndemocratic and just manner.\nHIV/AIDS remains rampant worldwide. The\nrecent grave disaster in the United States of America\nhas pushed other burning issues of the day off the\n13\n\nworld agenda, but people have not stopped dying of\nAIDS. The 26 million who have been forecast to\nsuccumb to the scourge in the next 10 years will still\nsuccumb. In the same way that the United States and\nthe European Union were able to persuade drug\ncompanies to produce drugs to combat anthrax at a\nfraction of their normal cost, the same drug companies\nshould be persuaded to produce affordable treatment\nfor this plague, which is causing a national security\nthreat to many poor countries.\nThe state of affairs of HIV/AIDS has reached\ncircumstances of extreme urgency in our country. The\nCaribbean is now only second to sub-Saharan Africa in\nhaving the fastest rise in the incidents of HIV/AIDS.\nWe are not equipped to handle this crisis. We are not\nable to afford the drugs to treat our people. Therefore,\nour people are dying \u2014 dying in their hundreds and\nthousands. This world crisis, unlike terrorism, is one of\nwhich we know exactly what is required. Do we have\nthe will to provide the necessary means in order to\nresolve this problem? The special session of the\nGeneral Assembly last June on HIV/AIDS ended with a\nglobal commitment to combat this disease. Are we\nliving up to our commitment?\nPrior to 11 September, our Government\nimplemented sound fiscal policies that resulted in\npositive economic growth for our country. However,\nafter that infamous day, the economic outlook turned\nextremely bleak. Our burgeoning tourist industry has\nsuffered tremendously, with employment taking an\nespecially heavy blow. Hotel occupancy dropped to a\n15-year low. There seems to be no end to the ripple\neffects on the industry. Just as people were beginning\nto fly again, we had the tragedy in Queens on Monday.\nThis plunges us deeper into economic gloom and the\nreal and frightening possibility of recession looms ever\ncloser.\nFollowing the admission of Tuvalu to the United\nNations last year, we were very close to realizing the\nprinciple of universality set forth in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. Now, only one remaining country\nawaits admission to the United Nations. That country,\nas we all know, is the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nThe Republic of China\u2019s impressive record of\neconomic and political development is one of the most\npersuasive reasons to eliminate the United Nations sole\nexception to universality. Fifty years ago, Taiwan was a\npoor and underdeveloped society. Fifty years later, the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan has become an affluent\nand prosperous country, with a per capita gross national\nproduct of around $14,000, annual trade of over $300\nbillion and a gross national product of $320 billion.\nAlthough the Republic of China is only the one\nhundred thirty-eighth largest country in the world in\nterms of lands and the forty-sixth largest in terms of\npopulation, it is today the world\u2019s seventeenth largest\neconomy, the fifteenth largest trading nation, the eighth\nlargest investor, the fourth largest holder of foreign\nexchange and the third largest exporter of information\ntechnology products.\nUnder our principle of universality, we cannot\ncontinue to exclude a country with such an impressive\nrecord of achievements. The time has come to open our\ndoors to the Republic of China on Taiwan.\nThe situation in Afghanistan calls for immediate\naction on the part of the United Nations to fill the\npower vacuum left by the departure of the ruling\nTaliban from the capital, Kabul. We must make sure\nthat the new administration is representative of all\nfactions and we must further ensure that the suffering\nand starving people receive immediate humanitarian\naid to ensure their survival through the coming winter\nmonths.\nFinally, I must reiterate that we are encouraged\nby the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to\nwork towards a society that ensures security and human\ndignity for all in the future. The future looks good if\nwe all work together for the betterment of mankind. I\nassure the Assembly that my Prime Minister, Mr. Ralph\nGonsalves, and the Government and people of Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines are fully committed to\nsupporting the United Nations in these endeavours, and\nmay God direct all of us on this path.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation\ncongratulates Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession. His election to that office is a demonstration of\nthe confidence and trust that the international\ncommunity has placed in him to steer it through the\nchallenges of our time. It is our fervent hope that,\nthrough his leadership, this Assembly will translate the\nMillennium Declaration into reality.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank\nhis predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for the\nsterling work accomplished during the past session of\nthe Assembly.\nToday, I am privileged to join others in\ncongratulating Mr. Kofi Annan for his re-election as\nUnited Nations Secretary-General for a second term.\nMr. Annan\u2019s re-election is indeed both a testimony to\nand recognition of his unique and rare abilities to give\nleadership, vision and unity of purpose to the\ninternational community in meeting the challenges that\nface us today. This recognition has been amply\ndemonstrated by the conferment of the prestigious\nNobel Peace Prize on the person of the Secretary-\nGeneral and on the United Nations. I congratulate both\nMr. Annan and the United Nations.\nThe Secretary-General enters the elite corps of\nNobel laureates at a time of most serious challenge to\ninternational solidarity and cooperation, as we reflect\non the events of 11 September, when the people of the\nUnited States of America, and indeed the whole world,\nwere plunged into unprecedented sorrow in the wake of\nthe heinous terrorist attacks here in New York and in\nWashington. This is indisputably the most brutal act of\nterrorism in this new millennium. Our hearts go out to\nthe families who lost their loved ones, and indeed all\nthe people and the Government of the United States. It\nis our duty as Members of this world body, which\nstands for global harmony, peace and security, to say\n\u201cNever again\u201d to such vileness. Zimbabwe lost two of\nits nationals in those tragic attacks.\nAs the people of the United States grapple with\nthe threat posed by biological weapons of mass\ndestruction in the form of anthrax, we in Zimbabwe,\nwho have hitherto been the greatest victims of this\nweapon, know what it means and what they are going\n35\n\nthrough. For during our own liberation struggle,\nanthrax was used as a weapon of mass destruction by\nthe racist regime of Ian Smith. The anthrax was\ndeveloped by the apartheid regime in South Africa\nunder the guidance of Dr. Basson, better known as \u201cDr.\nDeath\u201d, who then supplied it to Ian Smith. Many\nZimbabweans perished both before and after\nindependence. The anthrax spores that were spread by\nthe racist regime of Ian Smith during our liberation\nstruggle more than 20 years ago continue to claim\nvictims exclusively within the black population of our\ncountry to this day. More people and cattle have died of\nanthrax this year in Zimbabwe than elsewhere in the\nworld. Thus not only are we vehemently opposed to\nthis evil scourge and other forms of terrorism, but we\nalso know the pain and loss associated with it.\nIn my address to the General Assembly at last\nyear\u2019s session, I dwelt at length on the situation in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Since that time,\nsome progress has been made in implementing the\nceasefire agreement in that country. All those involved\nin the process \u2014 the signatories to the ceasefire\nagreement and the United Nations Security Council \u2014\nare agreed that conditions are favourable for the\ndeployment of United Nations peacekeepers under\nphase III of the deployment of the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC). As a matter of fact, just\nyesterday, the Security Council adopted resolution\n1376 (2001), supporting the launching of phase III\ndeployment of MONUC. Nevertheless, the Security\nCouncil, by adopting what it calls a step-by-step\napproach, continues to show excessive caution or\nhesitancy, almost indistinguishable from lack of\ncommitment or confidence, in the peace process in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. This is the major\nthreat to that peace process today.\nI wish to renew our appeal to the Security\nCouncil to more strongly and convincingly demonstrate\nits support for peace in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo by providing adequate human, financial and\nother resources. In this context, we note that as of 30\nSeptember 2001, unpaid assessed contributions for\nMONUC to the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nspecial account amounted to $246.9 million. In\naddition, the trust fund established by the Secretary-\nGeneral in October 1999 to support the peace process\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo had, two\nyears later, received only the paltry sum of $1.1\nmillion.\nThe serious matter of inadequate resources was\none of the major factors that contributed to the\ncurtailment, both in number of participants and in\nduration, of the inter-Congolese dialogue in Addis\nAbaba last month. We welcome and appreciate South\nAfrica\u2019s offer to host the next session of the national\ndialogue and meet some of the related expenses. We\nhasten to add, however, that South Africa must not be\nburdened and abandoned because of this generosity and\nwillingness to contribute to the peacemaking efforts.\nWe all must play our part in restoring peace and\nstability to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\nindeed to the Great Lakes region.\nThe continued unnecessary suffering and loss of\nlife among the civilians in Angola are indefensible.\nThrough the Sanctions Committee and other measures,\nwe have determined that UNITA must be denied and\ndeprived of the resources and means to continue to\nwage war against the Angolan people. It is time that we\nensure that those sanctions are indeed effective by not\nonly respecting that sanctions regime ourselves, but\nalso exposing those who continue to aid and abet\nUNITA in its deadly activities.\nThe situation in the Middle East demands urgent\naction and resolution on the basis of the long-standing\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973). The question of a Palestinian State brooks no\ndelay. Israel must bite the bullet and accept that until a\nPalestinian State becomes a reality, there can never be\nlasting peace in the Middle East.\nI must express our concern over the lack of\nprogress in the area of reforming the Security Council\nto make it more democratic and fully representative of\nthe aspirations of a large section of the international\ncommunity which has had a limited voice for far too\nlong. It is our considered view that conflict resolution\naround the globe could be enhanced by a reformed and\nmore representative Security Council.\nOn the eve of the Doha meeting, my delegation\nwould like to stress that necessary measures must be\ntaken to strengthen the ability of developing countries\nto be integrated in a beneficial way into the global\nsystem. The human and institutional capacities of\ndeveloping countries must be strengthened, and more\nemphasis must be placed on enhancing the role of trade\nand development, with better access provided for goods\n36\n\nand services from developing countries. Currently, we\nare experiencing a situation in which developing\ncountries in general, and African, Caribbean and\nPacific countries in particular, seem to lose through the\nWorld Trade Organization arrangement the little that\nthey had gained, even from previous protocols.\nOne of the most enduring features of the present\nand of the latter part of the last century has been the\npersistence of the colonial legacy in many developing\ncountries. That legacy has been evident in relations\nbetween and within States. We need not recall much\nmore evidence of the persistence of this phenomenon\nthan the proceedings of the World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa,\nbarely two months ago.\nThe continued refusal on the part of some former\ncolonial Powers to acknowledge the devastating effects\nthat colonialism has had, and continues to have, on the\neconomic development of most of the former colonies\nhas also been much in evidence. It is no accident that it\nis those former colonies that today occupy the lower\nrungs of the development totem pole.\nIn Zimbabwe, the colonial legacy is poignantly\nevident in the racially skewed land-ownership\nstructure, which is a direct result of racist policies and\nthe laws of successive colonial regimes between 1890\nand 1980. Over 70 per cent of the arable land \u2014 the\nbest of that land \u2014 is owned and utilized by less than 1\nper cent of the population, represented by\napproximately 4,100 white farmers, most of them of\nBritish descent, while nearly 13 million black\nZimbabweans eke out a living from the remaining 30\nper cent \u2014 the worst of the arable land. Such a\nsituation has to be corrected in the interests of equity,\njustice, social harmony and political stability in the\ncountry and, indeed, in our region of southern Africa.\nMy Government has begun a land reform and\nredistribution programme, which, while ensuring that\nmore people are settled on acquired land, will leave the\ncurrent owners with only one farm each. At present,\nsome of them own 18 farms each \u2014 and an average\nfarm in Zimbabwe is 2,000 hectares. Some, like the\nOpenheimer family, own land that is nearly the size of\nBelgium \u2014 one man owns property the size of\nBelgium in Zimbabwe. My Government\u2019s land reform\nprogramme guarantees that none of the white farmers\nwill be left landless. Every existing white farmer who\nwants to farm is assured of getting one farm. The\nprogramme is not about total alienation or\ndispossession, but about equitable redistribution. What\nis more generous or equitable than that?\nAs to who should pay for compensation, we\nreached understandings and agreements with the\nformer colonial master when we negotiated our\nindependence at Lancaster House in 1979. Obligations\nto pay compensation were assumed by the former\ncolonial Power. Provided that all parties honour their\nobligations, the so-called land crisis in Zimbabwe will\nevaporate overnight. That is the crisis in my country, to\nwhich the spokesman of the European Union referred\nfrom this rostrum. Zimbabwe has policemen in\nKosovo, policemen in Sierra Leone and policemen in\nEast Timor. We are trying to bring peace to the Congo.\nWe do not have a crisis; we have a land dispute.\nThe lofty objectives of the United Nations\nCharter in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled\nunless all Member States join in efforts, genuinely and\nseriously, to redress inherited colonial imbalances that\npersist in developing countries. Social justice, political\nstability and sustainable development in Zimbabwe can\nbe better achieved through genuine and committed\nsupport for land redistribution programmes than\nthrough the vilification or demonization of its\nleadership and policies.\nIt is most unfortunate that our efforts at rectifying\nunsustainable colonial imbalances are seen by some as\na crisis; the real crisis lies in the persistence of that\nlegacy. Zimbabweans are resolved to correct that\ncolonial injustice, in spite of the outcry from some\nquarters by people who regard the defence of the\npresent injustice as their historic responsibility. It is\nunacceptable that a minority, whether black or white,\nshould own over 70 per cent of the best arable land in\nany country. That may be acceptable in some countries;\nin Zimbabwe, we have decided to say \u201cNo\u201d.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a serious\ndevelopmental issue. As the Secretary-General\u2019s report\non the work of the Organization (A56/1) indicates, the\npandemic is destroying the economic and social fabric\nin our countries. Zimbabwe\u2019s infection rate among the\nadult population is estimated to be 30 per cent, while\nhundreds of thousands of children have already been\norphaned as a result of this dreaded disease. In the light\nof this, my Government and, indeed, those of other\ndeveloping countries, will need all the assistance we\n37\n\ncan get to complement our own efforts. We look\nforward to having this issue be seriously addressed by\nthe international community.\nThe international community should develop\nstrategies to ensure that AIDS drugs developed by\npharmaceutical companies become more affordable for\ndeveloping countries. Let me extend my sincere thanks\nto the Secretary-General for convening the special\nsession on HIV/AIDS in June this year. We hope that\nthe implementation of the resolutions of that\nconference will go some way towards checking the\nspread of the disease.\nIn conclusion, let me assure one and all that\nZimbabwe will partner all international efforts towards\nthe eradication of terrorism in all its forms, as well as\nexert all its energy in combating the pestilences that\nafflict humanity, especially poverty and\nunderdevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish to\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\nsession and to thank his predecessor for his valuable\ncontribution.\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\nGeneral, who was recently re-elected for a second\nterm. Over the past five years, my country has greatly\nappreciated his efficiency, charisma and excellent\ndiplomatic ability.\n14\n\nIn expressing its most sincere satisfaction, the\nRepublic of San Marino congratulates the United\nNations and its Secretary-General on having been\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this\nOrganization\u2019s ongoing commitment to peace and\nirreplaceable role and of its leader\u2019s outstanding\ndiplomatic skills and dedication, which have always\ncharacterized his fruitful activity.\nQuite understandably, these days the General\nAssembly is debating and wondering how and why the\nworld could change in just a few hours and how the\nprocess of civilization of the international community\ncould be so ferociously attacked. We have gathered in\nthe most important international forum to define the\nrole to be played by each country, individually or\nmultilaterally, and to determine how this daunting and\ninsidious challenge can be faced by each and everyone\nof us. Our discussions should also focus on how to\nadjust our national legal systems to better support a\nresolute fight against any form of international\nterrorism, strengthen our defence systems and promote\na common culture of solidarity and firm condemnation\nof any violation of and attack on human rights and civil\nco-existence, the respect and safeguard of which are\ncrucial.\nHowever, at a time of enormous difficulties, when\nthe wave of hatred and violence seems to be\ninexorable, the international community is sending a\nstrong signal of hope by showing its determination not\nto bend to people who, acting underground, try to\nspread terror and turmoil by any possible means. Large\nand small countries alike have joined forces to combat\nterrorism and have expressed their full solidarity with\nthe United States\u2019 outstanding example of democracy\nand liberty. To the United States and the families of the\nvictims, I wish to express my deepest sympathies and\ncondolences.\nAlmost all countries have seen the attack on the\nUnited States as an attack on each of them. That\nexplains why, in the face of such tragedies, many small\nnations, too, such as the Republic I represent today,\ncannot remain neutral by simply offering solidarity or\nmaking statements of principles. Each and every one of\nus is called upon to offer a determined and timely\ncontribution, however small, to the fight against\nterrorism, which my country has always condemned in\nall international forums as the main threat to peace.\nIn this spirit, San Marino immediately expressed\nits willingness to collaborate with the United States of\nAmerica and to fully comply with Security Council\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 1333 (2000) of 19\nDecember 2000 and 1373 (2001) of 28 September\n2001. This decision was motivated not only by the fact\nthat our Republic has been a Member of this\nOrganization for almost a decade, but above all by its\ninherent vocation to promote peace and respect for\nhuman rights, prompted by the conviction, matured\nover 1,700 years of peace and liberty, that any effort in\nthis direction helps to create and maintain international\nco-existence and mutual respect.\nThe Republic of San Marino will spare no effort\nin the global fight against terrorism, as it has already\ndone to prevent and combat money-laundering. To that\nend, it has adopted the necessary legislative\ninstruments and effective domestic measures and has\nactively participated in the action carried out in this\nfield by major international organizations, such as the\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Council of Europe\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope.\nMy country has successfully integrated many\ninternational provisions aimed at countering terrorism\nand intends to proceed to the ratification, as soon as\npossible, of those instruments that are not yet part of its\nlegal system. Indeed, San Marino is well aware of the\nimportance and effectiveness of international law,\nwhich has been expressly designed to promote\ncooperation in this field. In this context, the proposal\nsubmitted by India on a comprehensive anti-terrorism\nconvention should be taken into consideration as, today\nmore than ever, this is a very topical issue that deserves\nour greatest attention.\nAt the beginning of this new century, mankind\ncannot and must not move backwards. That would be\nextremely dangerous, as it would challenge the state of\ncivilization that mankind has worked so strenuously to\nachieve. All free spirits must do their utmost to avert\nthis potential defeat and embark on the path of\nsolidarity, cooperation and mutual understanding.\nI would also like to convey the hope expressed by\nthe Government of San Marino and major institutional\nbodies for intensified activity by the United Nations, in\nthe conviction that a more active role of the\nOrganization is needed to face the numerous\ninternational challenges that, aside from today\u2019s\n15\n\nexceptional circumstances, are still at the top of the\nworld political agenda.\nOn this occasion, I feel duty-bound to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and the President of\nthe General Assembly for having implemented, with\ngreat determination and courage, a major programme\nof reforms aimed at strengthening the United Nations,\nwell aware of the fact that only a continuous\nmodernization process will enable the Organization to\nwork effectively and to keep abreast of future\ndevelopments.\nIn this regard, San Marino has repeatedly stressed\nthe need for a reformed Security Council that, in better\nreflecting the new world order, would guarantee a\nhigher degree of representativeness, democracy and\ntransparency. We believe that such prerogatives can be\nensured by simply increasing the number of non-\npermanent members. Moreover, San Marino hopes that\nthe right of veto may be gradually restricted with a\nview to its eventual elimination. Indeed, my country is\nconvinced that the exercise of that right, or the mere\nthreat of its exercise, still represents a major obstacle\nto the proper functioning of the Organization.\nEqually important is the ongoing revitalization\nprocess of the General Assembly. The progress that has\nbeen achieved in terms of greater efficiency makes us\nbelieve that the General Assembly will regain its status\nas the major decision-making and representative body\nof the United Nations. My country hopes that the Ad\nHoc Working Group, open to all Member States, will\ncarry on this revitalization process.\nIn consideration of the pivotal role of the United\nNations in fostering international peace and security,\nthe Republic of San Marino is of the opinion that this\nOrganization is the most appropriate negotiating forum\nat the disposal of the community of nations. Besides\ncarefully following the Security Council\u2019s efforts to\naddress the latest events, my country has paid great\nattention to the Council\u2019s ongoing commitment to\nsettling the conflicts afflicting Africa. Today more than\never, we believe that the immediate implementation of\nthat body\u2019s decisions is crucial to restoring peace in a\ngeographical area already stricken by poverty,\nepidemics and underdevelopment.\nSan Marino is also seriously concerned about the\nescalation of violence and the increased hostilities in\nthe Middle East and hopes that, in that tormented and\ncontested land, dialogue and negotiations can be\nresumed as the sine qua non of a longed-for world\nreconciliation.\nAgainst today\u2019s international backdrop, the\nphenomenon of globalization also deserves careful\nconsideration. I am not referring exclusively to its\neconomic and commercial implications, though these\nare its most tangible components.\nMarket expansion and the progressive abolition\nof customs barriers have unquestionably contributed to\nexporting job opportunities and, eventually, to\neconomic well-being. On the other hand, however, the\ngap between the living conditions and standards of the\nNorth and the South, of the industrialized countries vis-\n\u00e0-vis the developing and least developed ones, which\nare also burdened by huge foreign debt, has widened\ndramatically. That gap must be immediately bridged in\norder to guarantee the globalization of opportunities\nalong with the globalization of markets.\nWe have all witnessed the anti-globalization\ndemonstrations in Seattle, Prague and, more recently,\nGenoa. Paradoxically, both the participants in the\nsummits and the demonstrators were striving for the\nsame objectives: poverty eradication, foreign debt\nrelief for developing countries and greater\nenvironmental protection. I believe that the existence\nof common objectives is a first step in the direction of\nan open and constructive exchange of views.\nThe Republic of San Marino also maintains that\npoverty alleviation is one of the major challenges\nfacing the international community for the immediate\nfuture. Future projects should address not only the lack\nof access to consumer goods, but also the lack of\neducation, liberty and participation in decision-making.\nIn this broader context, poverty is an insurmountable\nobstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms.\nRecently published data dramatically show that\nmore than 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 per\nday, and at least two thirds are illiterate; 830 million\npeople suffer from severe malnutrition, and 750 million\nare homeless, without access to health care. Moreover,\nhow can we ignore the fact that hundreds of millions of\nchildren are suffering from malnutrition, that 30,000\nchildren under five years of age are dying every day\nand that more than 500 million of them live on less\nthan $1 per day?\n16\n\nWell aware of the dramatic situation of many\ndeveloping countries, the Republic of San Marino has\nfully supported the initiatives sponsored by creditor\ncountries and international financial institutions to\nreduce or cancel foreign debts of highly indebted\nnations. Though not sufficient to mitigate the problem\nof poverty or to stop the vicious cycle of misery, these\ninitiatives reflect the will of both creditor and debtor\ncountries to find jointly a solution for the scourge of\npoverty and to share responsibilities.\nIt is not utopian to think that, by addressing and\nsolving the problems of hunger, poverty and the\ndisproportionate social, economic and cultural gaps\nbetween a minority living in the North and an\noverwhelming, poor and despairing majority living in\nthe South, terrorism will also be wiped out in the near\nfuture. Indeed, poverty and ideological extremism\nserve as fertile soil for terrorism, with its destructive\npotential and toll in human lives.\nOnce again, the Holy Father has rightly called on\nall States and peoples to struggle for justice, since this\nis the only way to affirm the pre-eminence of law for\nthe international community. Throughout its long and\nglorious history of freedom, San Marino has always\nfully shared this ideal.\nPrompted by these sentiments and determined to\nfurther support progressive international d\u00e9tente, for\nthe benefit of both nations and individuals, I reiterate\nthe hope of the Republic of San Marino that the\ninternational community, through the recognized\nability of the United Nations system, will be able to\ngive new impetus to the principles of dialogue and\ncooperation upon which it is based.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme, at the outset, to add my voice to those of the\ndistinguished speakers before me, to offer you, Sir, on\nbehalf of the people of the Congo and myself, our\nwarmest congratulations on your election as President\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The\nRepublic of Korea, your country, maintains excellent\nrelations with mine.\nMay I also use this opportunity to offer our most\nheartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, a\ndistinguished son of Africa, on his re-election to the\npost of Secretary-General and on the Nobel Prize,\nwhich has been awarded to him in recognition of his\ncommitment to the cause of promoting peace in the\nworld.\nThe people of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, its Government and I condemn unreservedly\nthe blind acts of terrorism that plunged the United\nStates and all of humanity into grief on 11 September\n2001. These were acts of gratuitous violence, which\ndeserve only the contempt of the whole international\ncommunity and of all nations that hold peace and\njustice dear.\nBy applying and implementing Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), my Government is committed\nto fully cooperate in advancing all initiatives aimed at\neliminating terrorism in all its forms.\nThe Congolese people, which is itself the\ninnocent victim of a war of aggression by Rwanda,\nUganda and Burundi \u2014 another kind of terrorism\ncharacterized by acts of barbarism that directly or\nindirectly brought about the death of millions of\nCongolese \u2014 had no trouble grasping the heinous\nnature the sad events that took place in the United\nStates of America on 11 September 2001.\nIt would be tiresome to go back over the origin\nand consequences of the war of aggression that started\non 2 August 1998, in flagrant violation of the Charters\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\nUnity (OAU). Thus, following the logic of peace and\nwell aware that only non-violent settlements bring\nlasting peace, I can but welcome the many peace\n12\n\ninitiatives that have sought to bring about negotiated\nsolutions to the conflicts.\nI have particularly in mind President Chiluba of\nZambia, the appointed mediator of the Lusaka peace\nprocess for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nI would also like to mention the Southern Africa\nDevelopment Community (SADC), and in particular\nAngola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which, in accordance\nwith the SADC charter, rallied around my country\nwhen it was attacked.\nI would also like to address my thanks and\ngratitude to the United Nations and the United Nations\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (MONUC), whose arduous work on the\nground has been very praiseworthy, and to the OAU,\nthe European Union and certain other traditional\npartners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe situation on the ground has improved in spite\nof the bad faith displayed by some of the parties to the\nLusaka Agreement. The disengagement of forces is in\nits final stages, and the effective end to hostilities\nwhich it has brought has been observed to the\nsatisfaction of all. However, the return of armed\ntension has been seen in the eastern part of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in the part of the\ncountry that is occupied by Rwanda. These hostilities\nhave been wrongly described as fighting that has\nmoved to the rear of the Rwandan forces. In fact, what\nwe see is the logical consequence of the failure of a\nnew plan by the Rwandan aggressors, who hoped to\nsweep away all Congolese resistance, the better to\noccupy the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo in order to be able to continue to pillage our\nwealth unchallenged.\nAs far as the disarmament of the armed groups is\nconcerned, we should note that a disarmament,\ndemobilization, repatriation, resettlement and\nreintegration (DDRRR) programme, drafted by\nMONUC and the Joint Military Commission (JMC),\nwas adopted by the Political Committee set up under\nthe Lusaka Agreement. It provides, first of all, for the\nvoluntary disarmament of all the armed groups in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In this respect, the\nCongolese Government, reaffirming its good faith and\nits commitment to this plan, has regrouped and\nconfined 3,000 Rwandan combatants in Kamina in\nKatanga province, and a MONUC mission has been\nthere for several days now in order to identify these\nparticular individuals.\nAs far as the withdrawal of foreign forces is\nconcerned, the definitive and total departure of all\nNamibian forces has been noted. This movement of\nforeign forces back to their countries is continuing;\nnow the Zimbabwean, Angolan and Ugandan military\nare beginning their withdrawal. Paradoxically,\nhowever, and despite the continuing demands by the\ninternational community through all of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, Rwanda is actually\nreinforcing its military presence in the Congo.\nThe process of reconciliation, so long awaited\nthrough national dialogue, made significant advances\nduring the preparatory meetings from 20-24 August\n2001 in Gaborone, thanks to the Republican pact\ninitiated by the Government of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo. I would like to take this\nopportunity to reiterate solemnly from this rostrum the\nfull commitment of my Government to participate fully\nin the sessions on this dialogue to be held in the\nRepublic of South Africa. I invite the facilitator to do\neverything possible to deal with pending issues in order\nto make sure that the forum regains its inclusive\ncharacter, as provided for by the Lusaka Agreement\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nFor the Government of the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo, it is important that representatives of all\nsectors of our population should be able to participate\nin this dialogue so as to lay the foundations of a\ndemocratic State. I would invite the international\ncommunity, at the appropriate time, to assist my\ncountry in organizing free, democratic and transparent\nelections, which would allow the Congolese people to\nchoose their own leaders, leaders who will have the\nlegitimacy that a popular election provides and which,\nin turn, guarantees political stability.\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\ninvite the United Nations to institute exemplary\nsanctions against all those States, their accessories and\naccomplices that are pillaging the wealth of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nI could not conclude my statement without\nthanking the Security Council members for having\nunanimously adopted resolution 1376 (2001) on 9\nNovember, which condemns the establishment of a\njoint force set up by the Congolese rebels, instigated by\nRwanda in violation of the Lusaka Agreement, in\n13\n\nviolation of the DDRRR plan and of all relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. This resolution is\nparticularly welcome for its providing for the\ndeployment of MONUC\u2019s phase III. It also provides for\nthe demilitarization of the city of Kisangani, the\nneutrality of Kindu and the reconstruction of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nIn my statement, I have condemned the infamous\nacts perpetrated against the people of the United States\nand of the world as a whole. I have also spoken of the\ncatastrophic situation in my country, which has been\nvictim of a war of aggression for the past three years. I\nhave also noted the significant advances achieved in\nthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, which unfortunately risks being compromised\nthrough the bad faith of Rwanda and its Congolese\nrebel accomplices.\nI have stressed how essential the support of the\ninternational community is if we are to achieve this\nprocess successfully and to launch the reconstruction\nof my country. The Congolese people, who have\nsuffered so much, are asking only one thing of the\nUnited Nations and the international community: that\njustice be done for the weak and the strong, for rich\nand poor alike.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly. Your sterling\ncredentials, Sir, and vast experience are a firm\nguarantee that our proceedings will run smoothly and\nbear fruit.\nI would also like to congratulate the United\nNations and the Secretary-General on the Nobel Peace\nPrize. The award is the acknowledgement of the\nimportant role our Organization has in protecting world\npeace and promoting social progress and human rights,\nas well as an acknowledgement of the successful\nleadership of the Secretary-General. This honour\nshould be strong encouragement for all of us to put\neven more effort into achieving the purposes of the\nUnited Nations.\nLet me also express our deepest sympathies to the\nfamilies of the victims of yesterday\u2019s tragic plane\ncrash.\nThe terrorist attacks in New York and Washington\non 11 September have affected not only the United\nStates but all of us. Once again, we were painfully\nreminded that only together, with joint efforts, can we\nstand up to global challenges such as terrorism.\nTerrorism is a universal evil, a crime against\nhumanity itself. It equally affects people of every\nreligion, nationality and walk of life. Therefore we did\nnot hesitate to support fully all international actions\nagainst terrorism. In that context, it is particularly\nimportant to ensure the full implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and all international\nconventions against terrorism. On behalf of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, I have just signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism. Yugoslavia has also taken a\nseries of domestic measures to combat terrorism and\nhas coordinated its actions with other States.\nHaving been confronted with terrorism for quite\nsome time itself, Yugoslavia is well aware of how\ndifficult it is to fight this evil. It is not enough to\nprevent terrorist attacks and to capture and punish the\nperpetrators. It is even more important to deal with the\nsocial causes of terrorism, in particular, to address\nissues of poverty and the lack of opportunity. It is also\nvital to strengthen democracy and respect for human\nrights everywhere in the world. Poverty breeds anger,\nand if not channelled into democratic political\nprocesses, anger can easily fuel extremism.\nIn this regard, the experience of Yugoslavia in\ndealing with terrorism in southern Serbia has shown\nthat it is not sufficient to combat terrorism solely with\nsecurity forces. We have therefore developed a\ncomprehensive plan which, in addition to security\nmeasures, also aims at improving the economic\nsituation in southern Serbia and reintegrating ethnic\nAlbanians into the political process and State\nstructures, especially at the local level. We are\nimplementing this plan in cooperation with a number of\ninternational organizations, and this joint effort has\nproven to be successful. At this very moment, we are\nsuccessfully training a multi-ethnic police force as an\nimportant confidence-building measure.\nAll this would not be possible without the victory\nof democratic forces in Yugoslavia last year. This\ndemocratic revolution showed the strong will of the\nYugoslav people to live in a democratic society based\non the rule of law, with full respect for human and\nminority rights and a sustainable market economy. It\nalso showed their desire to live better lives in a more\nprosperous society, in peace with their neighbours and\n36\n\nas a part of the European family of nations. In order to\nachieve these goals, Yugoslavia has started a process of\ncomprehensive political and economic reforms over the\nlast year.\nAt the same time, we have to deal with several\npressing issues which are of crucial importance for the\ncountry. Foremost among these issues is the situation\nin Kosovo and Metohija, southern Serbia and the\nredefinition of the Yugoslav Federation, as well as\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\nestablished by the Security Council for the war crimes\ncommitted in the former Yugoslavia. However, these\nquestions do not concern Yugoslavia alone; they are\nalso of vital political importance for the entire region\nof South-East Europe. My Government has approached\nall of them in a constructive way and with a desire to\nfind political solutions through dialogue in a\ndemocratic environment.\nToday, all countries in South-East Europe have\ndemocratically elected Governments, and all are\nstriving to join European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\nAt the same time, our region is still burdened with the\nlegacy of the past 10 years and a number of\noutstanding issues, the main issue of which is the\nposition of national minorities. The problems of the\nregion are interrelated and must therefore be addressed\nby broad regional action and with the help of the\ninternational community. The solutions to be achieved\nshould enjoy region-wide support.\nI believe that the precondition for dealing with\nthe problems in the region is to fully respect the\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries. It\nmust be clearly said that the era of disintegration in the\nBalkans has come to an end. This will enable us to\naddress the main problem of South-Eastern Europe \u2014\nthe status of national minorities \u2014 with fewer\nreservations and much more openness. Solving the\nminority issues, together with more economic\ncooperation and new confidence-building measures, is\nthe way to achieve lasting stability and prosperity in\nthe region. Such an approach will be fully in concert\nwith the wishes of all countries in the region, including\nYugoslavia, to join the European integration processes.\nIn that context, Yugoslavia supports the process of\nstabilization and association, inaugurated by the\nEuropean Union at the Zagreb Summit last year, as\nwell as other regional initiatives.\nKosovo and Metohija is the most pressing and\nimmediate preoccupation of my Government. The\nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\nfully complies with Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999). This is also what we rightly expect from others\nparticipating in its implementation and, in particular,\nneighbouring States.\nUnfortunately, we are not satisfied with the\nsituation in the field. There is no security for non-\nAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija; the return of\nexpelled and displaced persons is difficult and slow,\nand there is no progress with respect to the issue of\nmissing persons. Nonetheless, we signed the Common\nDocument with the United Nations Interim\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which\nshould provide for comprehensive cooperation in the\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\n(1999). This enabled the President of the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Federal and Serbian\nRepublican Governments to call on the Serbs of\nKosovo and Metohija to take part in the elections. They\ndid so fully convinced that participation in the\nelections is in the Serbs\u2019 best interest and that\ncooperation with the international community,\nparticularly with UNMIK and KFOR, is the key to the\nsolution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija.\nThe elections to be held in Kosovo and Metohija\non 17 November are important indeed; yet, it is only\nafter the elections that I expect we will start even more\nextensive cooperation. This cooperation should be\naimed at implementing Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999) fully and at establishing democracy and\npromoting human rights in Kosovo and Metohija, with\nfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity\nof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In that\nconnection, my delegation welcomes the presidential\nstatements issued by the Security Council on 5 October\nand 9 November 2001.\nI take this opportunity to affirm the support of the\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia for the efforts of the\nUnited Nations, particularly those of the Secretary-\nGeneral, aimed at strengthening the role and place of\nthe world Organization in present-day international\nrelations.\nRecalling the conclusions of the Millennium\nAssembly, we expect that the General Assembly, the\nmain organ of the United Nations, will function more\neffectively. At the same time, the Organization should\n37\n\nbe more efficient in order to address the challenges\nbefore us. The Security Council should adapt itself to\nthe new relations in the international community.\nWe attach special significance to the international\nrule of law. It is of particular importance that all\ninternational crimes be punished before national and\ninternational courts. In that context, we firmly believe\nthat the International Criminal Court should start its\nwork as soon as possible. This is why my country has\nalready ratified the Statute of Rome that establishes the\nCourt.\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that grave\nchallenges are before us. We have to take concerted\naction to deal with them. We have to be wise in how we\nact because that will determine the outlook of the\ninternational system for many years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOnce again, we have\nwitnessed a terrible incident in the neighbourhood of\nthe United Nations here in New York. Although we do\nnot know the circumstances, we are shocked, and it is\nclear that many have lost their lives. I express my\nsincere condolences to all those who have lost their\nloved ones in this tragic incident.\n20\n\nAllow me to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly.\nI am confident that he will guide us wisely through the\ncomplex tasks ahead of us in this session.\nThe ability of the United Nations to act swiftly in\nresponse to acute crisis was seriously tested following\nthe terrorist attacks on the United States. During these\ntrying times, it has been valuable to have at the helm a\nSecretary-General who enjoys such wide support.\nLet me congratulate the Secretary-General and\nthe United Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace\nPrize \u2014 in my view, a well-deserved recognition of\nKofi Annan\u2019s leadership and of the dedication he and\nhis staff have put into upholding the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Hopefully, the\naward will serve as an inspiration as well as strengthen\nworldwide support for the United Nations and what it\nstands for.\nThe tragic events of 11 September have radically\nchallenged and changed our security environment.\nFighting terrorism should therefore become a priority\nof the United Nations. We recognize that the United\nNations has long been active in the fight against\ninternational terrorism, but we now need to go beyond\npolitical statements and become truly operational. This\nmeans developing new methods and, at the same time,\nmaking full use of all the means at the disposal of the\nUnited Nations system, the truly global character of the\nOrganization and the numerous international legal\ninstruments available to us.\nIceland strongly supports the creation of a\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nand hopes that an agreement can be reached on such an\ninstrument during the fifty-sixth session. Otherwise, we\nwill lose the opportunity to develop the coherent\nstrategy lacking today. We cannot fail to react.\nThe key role the United Nations should play in\nfighting international terrorism must be an impetus to\nus to intensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects.\nIceland is seriously concerned about the slow progress\nmade towards reaching this goal. It is essential and\ntimely that the membership of the Council becomes\nmore representative, and thus more likely to sustain the\npresent international coalition in the fight against\nterrorism. It goes without saying that the efficiency of\nthe Council must be secured. Enhancing transparency\nin the decision-making process is also of importance,\nespecially for non-member States.\nOne of the main purposes of the United Nations is\nto promote and encourage respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\nrace, sex, language or religion. This continues to be of\nthe utmost importance. Let me therefore make it\nabsolutely clear that the fight against terrorism is not,\nand must not become, a fight against any religious or\nethnic group. We must avoid all forms of\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. Most\nimportantly, we must at all times adhere to the basic\nvalues of human rights, freedom and democracy.\nTurning to the actions at the national level,\nIceland is taking the necessary steps to ratify all\nrelevant United Nations conventions against terrorism\nthat we have not already ratified. Furthermore, Iceland\nhas implemented all relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including resolution 1373 (2001). But in\nfighting the menace of international terrorism \u2014 a\nfight that we all agree needs to be both wide-ranging\nand forceful \u2014 we must, at the end of the day, not in\nany way undermine the basic values of our societies \u2014\nthose of human rights, the rule of law, and democracy.\nWe need to strike a balance between freedom and the\nsecurity measures we opt for.\nUprooting terrorism in the world must go hand in\nhand with solving regional conflicts that threaten\ninternational peace and security. This is particularly\ntrue for the Middle East. By prolonging the violence\nand refusing to negotiate, both sides play into the\nhands of extremist elements that want neither a\ncontinuation of the peace process nor a political\nsolution to the Middle East conflict. Both parties have\nto resume negotiations unconditionally. That is the only\nway to secure lasting peace in the region, which should\nbe based upon the establishment of a viable and\ndemocratic Palestinian State and on the right of the\nIsraelis to live in peace and security within\ninternationally recognized borders. A continuation of\nthe present dire conditions cannot be tolerated any\nlonger.\nI said earlier that the events of 11 September have\nmade United Nations reforms even more urgent. The\nsame is true for the ongoing work to strengthen the\npeacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations. Until\nnow, Iceland\u2019s participation in United Nations\npeacekeeping operations has been modest. My country\n21\n\nhas participated in peacekeeping by providing civilian\npersonnel such as gender experts and police and health\nprofessionals. With the changing and more complex\nnature of peacekeeping, the need for civilian personnel\nhas been increased. The Icelandic Government decided\nlast year systematically to increase its contribution to\npeacekeeping. Our aim is to provide more personnel to\nthe United Nations, as well as to the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European\nUnion.\nBy adopting resolution 1325 (2000) last year, on\nwomen, peace and security, the Security Council\nrecognized the importance of incorporating a gender\nperspective into peacekeeping operations. When the\nUnited Nations becomes involved in peace-building\nand reconstruction in Afghanistan we have to make\nsure that resolution 1325 (2000) is honoured in the\nprocess, for the benefit of Afghan women and, as a\nresult, for the Afghan population as a whole. The\nUnited Nations must play a key role in the nation-\nbuilding process in Afghanistan. Iceland stands ready\nto contribute civilian experts should the United Nations\nbecome involved in a post-conflict operation.\nNext year, 10 years will have passed since world\nleaders met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. We\nare asked, what has been accomplished in this past\ndecade to secure the prosperity of future generations in\nharmony with nature? The truth is that there has been\nrather little progress and that we face enormous tasks.\nThe world community will look towards the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg,\nfor further commitments by all nations.\nIn that context, I would like to quote Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who in his opening remarks at the\n44th meeting, last Saturday, said\n\u201cWe must put the issue of sustainability where it\nbelongs, in the centre of the policy-making\nprocess.\u201d\nIt is therefore imperative that we renew our strong\ncommitment to sustainable development at the\nJohannesburg Summit. We are faced with new\nchallenges, but also with new opportunities, namely, to\nbuild a global partnership to harness the forces of\nglobalization in favour of sustainable development.\nThe world community has just achieved, in\nMarrakech, a milestone agreement on the\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto\nnegotiations have been especially difficult. Now we\nhave reached the moment when we can bring the\nProtocol into force. But more needs to be done to\ninclude other key emitters of greenhouse gases in the\nbattle against climate change.\nIn the area of oceans \u2014 the foundation of human\nlife \u2014 we have made some progress. We have adopted\nsignificant agreements, and we are looking at ways to\nimprove the assessment of the state of the oceans in\norder to further enhance marine protection and\nmanagement. New knowledge and new approaches are\nalso evolving, thus providing the world community\nwith opportunities to improve protection of the oceans\nand the sustainable use of their living resources.\nLast October, Iceland, in cooperation with the\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations and Norway, hosted the Reykjavik Conference\non Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. In a\ndocument adopted by the Conference, States declared\nthat they would incorporate ecosystem considerations\ninto fisheries management with the aim of reinforcing\nresponsible and sustainable fisheries in the marine\necosystem. This Reykjavik Declaration is a landmark\ncontribution of the fisheries nations to the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development. We trust that we\nwill see the spirit of the Declaration reflected in the\nresults of the World Summit in Johannesburg.\nThe time has come for a unified effort by political\nleaders, as well as by civil society and the private\nsector, to reverse the trend of marginalization and\nunderdevelopment. That is why the International\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\nin Mexico next year, offers an unprecedented\nopportunity to make a real difference in the lives of\nmillions of people throughout the developing world.\nThe outcome of the Conference should focus on the\ngreat challenge of poverty eradication, as well as on\nhow responsibilities between the developed and\ndeveloping countries should be shared. We should,\nhowever, never lose sight of each State\u2019s primary\nresponsibility for its own development. The importance\nof responsible national governance and respect for\nhuman rights cannot be overstated.\nMy focus, like that of many speakers before me,\nhas been on the fight against international terrorism.\nFighting international terrorism involves all States and\ninternational as well as regional organizations. We\n22\n\nmust concentrate on the available instruments of each\norganization and find ways to adjust them as necessary.\nFurthermore, we need to ensure consistency and\ncomplementarity of international efforts.\nThe malicious acts of 11 September and the latest\nshocking news of the suspicion of biological terrorism\ndemonstrate that all of our concerted efforts are not\nonly necessary but also crucial to fulfilling our duty to\nprotect the lives of our citizens.\nThe United Nations was founded to preserve\npeace and to work for a better world. Terrorists are\nfighting against everything the United Nations stands\nfor. Fighting against them means fighting for the\nUnited Nations, for the future of our civilization and\nfor all humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, may I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his\nelection to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I assure him that he has the\nHungarian delegation\u2019s full support in the effective\nfulfilment of his tasks and high responsibility. At the\nsame time, I wish to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri for the\nmuch appreciated work that he carried out in his\ncapacity as President of the preceding session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nSixty-three days have elapsed since 11\nSeptember. More than 80 nations are in mourning\ntoday, mourning the absurd deaths of their compatriots,\nmen and women from all over the world and\nrepresenting different and various traditions, cultures,\nbeliefs and ethnic origins. Approximately 6,000 people\nperished as a result of heinous terrorist attacks in New\nYork, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, and we\nremember the victims in our prayers and extend our\ndeep sympathy and compassion to their families and\nfriends.\nThese attacks were committed against the entire\ncivilized world and against fundamental human values.\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly very\nquickly took firm and clear measures in order to defend\nthe universal interests of the international community.\nTo this end, an effective global coalition was created in\nwhich Hungary, side by side with many other countries,\nis proudly participating. Those who perpetrated and\nsupported these terrorist attacks are trying to depict\ntheir acts, as well as the reaction of legitimate self-\ndefence to those acts, as a war of religion. Clearly it is\nnothing of the sort. There can be no justification for\nthese acts, nor for any other terrorist activities\nanywhere else. In fact, international terrorism pursues\npolitical objectives and is trying to undermine our\nmulti-ethnic and multi-concessional world, to\nexacerbate regional conflict, to pit various cultures one\nagainst another and to impose on us by force its own\norder of hatred and fanaticism. The nature of the\nchallenge with which we are confronted is eminently\nstrategic: first, because it calls into question the raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre and endangers the very existence of our\ncivilization; secondly, because the terrorist network,\nwhich is organizing against us, has managed to develop\nglobal capacities; and, lastly, because in the war that is\ndeclared against us, terrorism abides by no legal order\nand follows no rules.\nWe can welcome the fact that, on the basis of a\nconvergence of interests, cooperation among States has\nacquired, in the two months following the terrible\nevent, a dimension that is very promising and entirely\nnew. But major combat against international terrorism\nwill certainly not be short. Of course the military\naction launched against the Taliban regime and the\nterrorist Al Qaeda organization represent an important\nelement, but not the only one, within the framework of\ninternational action. Within this struggle, the tasks that\nwe have to carry out are complex and multifaceted. We\nhave to do our utmost in the political, diplomatic,\neducational, legal, and also financial, humanitarian,\neconomic and social areas to make sure that we, in the\nfinal analysis, emerge victorious from this struggle. We\nmust recognize that in this struggle we have to\nredouble our efforts to promote the rule of law, to\nreject extremism, intolerance, discrimination and\nnationalistic tendencies and to intensify the global\nwork that has to be accomplished in order to eradicate\npoverty and ensure sustainable development. The fight\nagainst terrorism is part and parcel of the general\n18\n\nframework of this global endeavour within which we\nare trying to build a better world.\nThe terrorist attacks against the United States will\nprobably be remembered as a turning point in our\nhistory, and also an opening to a new era. What is\ncertain is that from now on humanity will not be able\nto continue in the same way as before. Governments\nhave to shoulder major responsibility vis-\u00e0-vis this\nchallenge, which now touches directly upon our\neveryday existence. The international community\nmanaged to find the most appropriate response by\nbringing together a coalition unprecedented in inter-\nState relations, the historic importance of which will\ncertainly go far beyond our own era. Hungary stands\nready, within the limit of its capacity, to take an active\npart in that coalition.\nIn the present situation, the United Nations is\ncalled upon to play a role of primary importance, to\nstrengthen the effectiveness of international action.\nThrough the development of 12 anti-terrorist\nconventions, the United Nations has already\ncontributed very significantly towards the development\nof a common framework of international law in the\nfight against terrorism. Through the adoption of other\nconventions, which are now being prepared, the legal\nframework will become even more comprehensive and\ngeneral. However, in order to do that, we must make\nnew efforts and, given the importance of what is at\nstake, and the fact that we have common goals, the\ngroups of countries concerned should display a greater\ndegree of flexibility. The United Nations should be able\nfully to play its role of enhancing the practical\nimplementation of international anti-terrorist\ncooperation.\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks, a series of\nspecific measures were implemented by my country\u2019s\nGovernment. At the international level we have\nstrengthened our cooperation, both political and legal,\nin the anti-terrorist area with our allies at NATO and\nour partners within the European Union (EU). We\ndecided also to implement Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), and we will forward to the Committee\nthat was established under the terms of that resolution a\ndetailed report on the national measures undertaken by\nHungary to fight terrorism. I should like to recall at\nthis stage that Hungary is a party to most of the\ninternational, multilateral conventions against\nterrorism.\nAs regards the two most recently passed United\nNations conventions in this area, let me state that my\ncountry has just deposited today with the Secretary-\nGeneral the instrument of ratification for the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings. I should like to announce that\nHungary will sign the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism in the\nupcoming weeks. We are determined to become a party\nto that Convention as quickly as possible, so as to\ncomplement the Hungarian participation in\ninternational conventions that are universal in nature\nand deal with the fight against terrorism. Furthermore,\nmy Government recently submitted to Parliament a\ndraft law to strengthen national regulations in the areas\nof money-laundering and fighting terrorism.\nHungary attaches very special importance to the\nsuccess of the international humanitarian action in\nAfghanistan. Through the two Hungarian humanitarian\norganizations, which traditionally have played a role in\nthe region, my Government has started to forward\nhumanitarian assistance to the refugees and the Afghan\npopulation. Such assistance consists of foodstuffs and\nblankets for about 15,000 people.\nMy Government is very deeply concerned at the\ndanger represented by the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction and their means of delivery. Our\ncommitment in favour of multilateral control over such\nweapons remains unchanged and we participate in\ninternational efforts aimed at limiting and eliminating\nweapons of mass destruction. The tragic events of 11\nSeptember and the recent anthrax-related incidents\nmake us realize the possible dramatic consequences of\nthe absence of a reaction by the community of nations\nto the challenge presented by weapons of mass\ndestruction, including biological weapons. We think\nthat the strengthening of the Convention on the\nProhibition of the Development, Production and\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\nWeapons and on Their Destruction will enable the\ninternational community to act even more effectively\nagainst the intent to use biological agents for military\nobjectives. The ad hoc group asked to work out\nmeasures for implementation managed to make notable\nprogress in the almost seven years of its history, and is\nvery near agreement. We regret that it could not\nfinalize its work before the date of the Fifth Review\nConference of the Convention. It is important that the\nConference should leave aside the divergence of views\n19\n\nwith regard to the approach to the modalities of the\nlong-term strengthening of the Convention, and that\ninstead it should underscore the commitment\nundertaken by Member States to promote the integrity\nof the system of the prohibition of biological weapons.\nIn its capacity as Chair of the Fifth Review\nConference, Hungary would like to do its utmost in\norder to justify the hopes expressed by Member States\nand public opinion that specific results will emerge\nfrom the Conference. We would like actively to\ncontribute to making sure that efforts aimed at\nstrengthening the system of prohibition of biological\nweapons will also continue without interruption after\nthe Conference.\nThe Statute of the International Criminal Court is\na political and legal document of capital importance. It\ntranslates into fact the historic aspiration we have had\nthat those who commit the crimes of genocide, war\ncrimes and crimes against humanity will not be allowed\nin future to act with impunity. Therefore, we warmly\nwelcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by a\nrapidly growing number of countries, to date\nnumbering more than 40. Within this context I wish to\nannounce here that the Hungarian Parliament, by a\nresolution that was adopted almost unanimously,\nratified the Statute on 6 November. The deposition of\nthe instrument of ratification will take place in the\ncourse of this month of November.\nHungary is working actively so as to ensure that\nthe Court, this very important institution of our era, can\nstart working in the near future. We should also make\nefforts to ensure that it will be universally accepted as\nsoon as possible because only in that way will it be\nable to be successful in its work and effective in the\narea of maintaining peace and international security\nand effectively protecting international humanitarian\nlaw and human rights.\nOur world has changed and we all have to change\nwith it. Unfortunately, when I say that I am not saying\nthat earlier challenges have disappeared but rather that,\nin addition to the difficulties we already have, we are\nfacing a new crisis that compels us to think\nstrategically and at the same time be very resolute in\nour action. The work that we have to carry out is\ntherefore wider and broader and the only choice we\nhave is to act on the basis of our human values in the\ninterests of our civilization and future security. The\nUnited Nations is part and parcel of that endeavour.\nThe Millennium Declaration speaks of it with great\neloquence and the events of 11 September only\nstrengthen the message contained therein by\nunderscoring the crucial nature of the times we live in,\na crossroads between two centuries and two millennia.\nWe are asked to provide answers to the global\nquestions that haunt us and that have been continuously\nplaguing this world. The success or failure of our\nefforts to provide such answers will, without any\ndoubt, affect the quality of life of the whole of the\ntwenty-first century. It is in this spirit that my\ndelegation wishes to provide its contribution to the\nsuccess of the deliberations, held under the very special\ncircumstances of the present session of the General\nAssembly.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis session of the\nGeneral Assembly is being held at a very difficult time\nfor all of us. I congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous\nelection to the position of President of the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly and I sincerely wish\nyou all success in guiding the work of the session and\nwould like to assure you of our full support.\nUnder the current circumstances, enhancement of\nthe United Nations effectiveness becomes increasingly\nimportant, and in this regard, I would like to express\nour special gratitude to Mr. Harri Holkeri, whose\nactivity as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\nGeneral Assembly was an example of the commitment\nto the revitalization process of the Organization.\nWe regard the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the\nUnited Nations and Mr. Kofi Annan as evidence of the\ninternational community\u2019s recognition of the special\nrole played by the Organization and of the great service\nof its Secretary-General. Congratulating our Secretary-\nGeneral, I would like to stress that we place special\nhope in him and to reiterate our support for his\nactivities aimed at achieving those very objectives for\nthe sake of which the United Nations was created.\nThe Millennium Summit identified challenges in\nthe context of global development that can be\naddressed only through coordinated efforts by the\nentire international community within the United\nNations system.\nOne year ago, nobody could have foreseen the\ntragedy that would befall all of us, a tragedy that has\nshown the depth of the abyss before which the world\nfinds itself today. The dramatic events that struck the\nUnited States make it imperative for us to take a new\nlook at the aspects of global development in the\ntwenty-first century.\nThreats and risks in the context of globalization\nacquire new scale and character, and the international\ncommunity must change its approaches accordingly.\nToday, an attack against one of us is considered as an\nattack against all of us. Will this approach become\nuniversal?\nAzerbaijan suffered from a series of horrific\nterrorist attacks that were part and parcel of the conflict\nimposed on Azerbaijan by neighbouring Armenia.\nUnfortunately, our warnings about the terrorist threat,\nas well as our appeals to the international community\nto join efforts in the fight against this evil, made from\nthis very podium, went unheeded.\n26\n\nTerrorism is closely linked to aggressive\nseparatism and other forms of extremism, as well as to\norganized crime, drug and arms trafficking and other\nillegal activities that literally flourish in conflict zones\nand that provide terrorist and separatist groups with\nfinancial resources. Terrorism and separatism get large-\nscale outside support from States and private structures\nalike. Response to these threats must not be selective.\nThey can be eliminated only through adequate and\ncomprehensive countermeasures undertaken on the\nbasis of the principles and norms of international law\nagainst all those who use terror to achieve their goals,\nleaving them no hope of escaping unpunished. Nothing\ncan justify terrorism. There should be no room for\ndouble standards, palliatives or narrow national\ninterests.\nWe all have witnessed many manifestations of\nterrorism that have taken place in different regions of\nthe world, under different slogans and covers. This fact\nby itself clearly shows that the phenomenon of\nterrorism is not associated with any particular religion.\nHence, the fight against terrorism should not be a fight\nagainst a religion. We must take effective measures to\nreverse a dangerous trend of imprudent instigation to\nhostility between Islam and Christianity.\nThe legal, political, military and other actions\ntaken today by the international coalition are not the\nonly prerequisites for a successful fight against\nterrorism. It is necessary to redouble the efforts aimed\nat assisting and enabling the least developed countries\nin the process of their social and economic\ndevelopment to use the opportunities provided by\nglobalization.\nUnfortunately, in many regions of the world we\nstill see violent conflicts that claim tens of thousands\nof lives and undermine the sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and security of States. One such example is\nthe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Masking\nits claims to the Azerbaijani territory under the banner\nof the struggle for the self-determination of the\nArmenian population of the Nagorny-Karabakh region\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia\nhas occupied this Azerbaijani territory, as well as seven\nadjacent regions of Azerbaijan, and has conducted\nethnic cleansing on the occupied territory, which has\nresulted in the expulsion of 1 million Azerbaijanis from\ntheir homes.\nMy country has been waiting for eight years for\nthe Security Council to take practical steps to\nimplement the following four resolutions concerning\nthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict: 822 (1993), 853\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). The Council\nadopted these resolutions back in 1993 in order to take\nenforcement measures against the aggressor, in\naccordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\nUntil now, mediation activities of the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE) Minsk Group, which is co-chaired by the\nUnited States, France and Russia, and which will be 10\nyears old next year, have not produced any results, so\nthe tenth anniversary may turn out to be a sad one.\nArmenia continues to violate the principles and\nnorms of international law enshrined in the United\nNations Charter and the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, and\nit ignores the provisions of the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions and OSCE decisions. Rejecting this\ninternational legal basis for the settlement of the\nconflict, Armenia negotiates from the position of\npower and on the basis of fait accompli, trying to\nconsolidate the results of its armed aggression and to\nannex a part of Azerbaijan territory.\nArmenia states that there is a conflict between\ncertain principles of international law, but there is not a\nconflict between those principles. The right of self-\ndetermination cannot be regarded as a right to forcible\nseparation of a part of a State\u2019s territory and must not\njustify the violation of the principle of territorial\nintegrity of States, in our case, that of the Republic of\nAzerbaijan. Indeed, the real conflict is between\nArmenia and international law, which prevents\nArmenia from realizing its claims to the territory of\nneighbouring States.\nThe international community should not choose\nthe easiest course of action and should not recognize\nthe right of the powerful. Instead, it must act in\naccordance with the established principles and norms\nof international law and the decisions of international\norganizations.\nIt is unacceptable to blame both sides for the\ndeadlock in the negotiations, ignoring the differences\nbetween the compromises and concessions demanded\nof Azerbaijan, on the one hand, and those demanded of\nArmenia, on the other. The aggressor and the victim\ncannot be held equally responsible.\n27\n\nThe Republic of Azerbaijan stands ready for a\nresolution of the conflict based on the principles of\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the granting of\nself-governance to all the people of the Nagorny-\nKarabakh region within the Azerbaijani State. The\nRepublic of Azerbaijan is prepared to provide safety\nand security for this region\u2019s population.\nAzerbaijan is interested in a just and peaceful\nresolution of the conflict more than anybody else, and\nwe will continue to undertake all the necessary steps to\nachieve tangible results. But our efforts alone are not\nenough. Expeditious settlement of the conflict should\nbecome one of the main priorities for the international\ncommunity. There is no room for stop-gap measures\nand \u201cwait-and-see\u201d positions. The situation demands\nfundamental approaches and actions on everyone\u2019s\npart. We expect a very significant contribution from the\nco-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference at the highest\nlevel.\nAzerbaijan, which for eight years has been\nhosting 1 million refugees and internally displaced\npersons, continues to face an acute humanitarian\nproblem that will only be resolved completely by\ncreating the conditions necessary for them to return to\ntheir homes as soon as possible. Crises in the\nneighbouring regions have created another problem for\nmy country, which now has to deal with a significant\nnumber of refugees from other countries. Taking all\nthese difficulties into consideration, we deem it\nnecessary for the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Baku to\ncontinue its functions. Currently, Azerbaijan needs\neven greater UNHCR assistance, as well as assistance\nfrom other United Nations humanitarian agencies and\ndonor countries. I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all of\nthe aforementioned who have given their support and\nassistance.\nWe believe that in order to enhance the\neffectiveness and efficiency of United Nations\nactivities in the area of the prevention of armed\nconflict, it is necessary to better monitor the\nimplementation of Security Council decisions. To this\nend, we propose, for general consideration, that the\nSecurity Council adopt the practice of submitting to the\nGeneral Assembly periodic reports on the\nimplementation of the Council\u2019s decisions.\nWe deem it necessary to strengthen the capability\nof United Nations rapid deployment forces. The faster\nthe international community can react to the outbreak\nor resumption of a conflict, the easier peace and justice\nwill be restored.\nGlobalization should enable us to promote\nsustainable development and the integrity and stability\nof public administration systems, eliminate\ndiscrimination in economic activity and ensure\nprosperity for all peoples. Azerbaijan is contributing to\nmoving this process forward. We are sparing no effort\nto restore the Great Silk Route, to create a Europe-\nCaucasus-Asia transport corridor and to develop\ndeposits of hydrocarbons in the Caspian Sea basin and\ntransport them to world markets. These projects are of\nparamount importance in terms of the free and\nsustainable development of States in several regions of\nthe world. Furthermore, they will give impetus to\ntransregional cooperation and will serve as a factor that\ndetermines global development.\nThe free exploitation of natural resources and\ntheir transportation to world markets is the inalienable\nright of a sovereign State. Azerbaijan calls upon all the\nCaspian Sea States to refrain from the use or threat of\nforce in the Caspian Sea basin. The Caspian Sea must\nbe a sea of peace and cooperation. Azerbaijan supports\nearly agreement on the delimitation of the Caspian Sea\non the basis of principles and norms of international\nlaw and established practice in the use of the Caspian\nSea.\nAs a member of the group of landlocked\ncountries, Azerbaijan needs assistance from the\ninternational community to develop its transport\ninfrastructure in order to integrate it effectively into the\nglobal economy.\nIn its efforts to implement the concepts\nunderlying transregional cooperation, Azerbaijan is\ntaking a multi-track approach and working within the\nframework of a number of structures. One of them is\nGUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan\nand Moldova), an organization consisting of five newly\nindependent States whose names form the acronym and\nwhose economies are in transition. The States members\nof GUUAM, which celebrate the tenth anniversary of\ntheir independence this year, have confronted\nnumerous challenges and threats during the difficult\nperiod of the formation and development of their\nstatehood. Such threats have manifested themselves\n28\n\nmost clearly during the periods of armed conflict which\nbroke out in three of those five member States.\nGUUAM stands for the speedy, peaceful settlement of\nconflict based on the norms and principles of\ninternational law enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter, the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other\nrelevant documents and decisions of the United\nNations and OSCE.\nCurrently, the GUUAM member States, located in\nEurope, the Caucasus and Central Asia, are trying to\nachieve greater integration into the world economy\nand, to this end, are actively cooperating in creating\nmultidirectional transport corridors and in ensuring\ntheir safety and security.\nWithin the framework of humanitarian\ncooperation, we regard as very promising a GUUAM\ninitiative aimed at creating a Europe-Caucasus-Asia\ncultural corridor, which would promote cooperation in\nsuch areas as culture, science and education. Joint\nprojects in the area of tourism will also have a\nsignificant role to play.\nThe United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) has actively assisted Azerbaijan in addressing\nthe development issues it faces. At the same time, the\nGovernment of Azerbaijan is deeply concerned by the\ncontinuing decrease in the core resources of UNDP.\nDeveloping countries and economies in transition need\na strong UNDP that is able to provide effective\nassistance in the most complex spheres of\ndevelopment. The Government of Azerbaijan calls\nupon donor countries to increase the financial base of\nofficial development assistance, both multilaterally and\nunilaterally. In distributing official development\nassistance special attention should be paid to the needs\nof African countries, the least developed countries, the\nsmall island States and the landlocked States.\nAzerbaijan places a great deal of hope in the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, to be held in 2002. As a member of the\nCommission on Sustainable Development, Azerbaijan\nintends to make a constructive contribution to ensure\nthe success of these important events and to promote\nthe sustainable development of weak economies.\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that we all\nbear a tremendous responsibility. Today as never\nbefore, we must act wisely and use our power and\nresources not to escalate hatred and violence, but to\npromote peace and justice, stability and the\ndevelopment of our fragile planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to\ncongratulate the President, Mr. Han Seung-soo, on his\nelection and also to express my deep appreciation to\nhis predecessor, Mr. Holkeri, for his excellent work\nduring the past year.\nThe nations that constitute this Organization are\ntoday attempting to draft a comprehensive convention\nagainst terrorism, a difficult but absolutely necessary\ntask. We may not yet agree on how to define terrorism,\nhowever the world, with a near unanimous voice,\ncondemned the 11 September events. The world\nshowed solidarity with the American people, the\nUnited States Government, and President Bush. That\nhighlights a simple truth and a profound consensus, a\nconsensus that this was an act against humanity, a\nconsensus that this was a crime against the values we\nhold dear as human beings and as societies, and a\nconsensus that justice must be done.\nFrom the ruins of this tragedy there rises a\nnewborn moral strength, a clarion call to change this\nworld, a call to create a moral order, a world\ncommunity of values where a genuine sense of justice\ncan prevail. It is in our hands today \u2014 in fact it is our\nresponsibility to rise to this occasion, take a bold step\nbeyond our traditional rivalries and consolidate a new\nspirit of cooperation. Let us make this a common fight\nfor humanity. To do so we need not abandon our\nnational interests. We do, however, need to place them\nin a wider context, a world order based on common\npractices, shared principles and global values. We must\ngo beyond rhetoric. That also means that our\nresponsibilities must reach beyond our borders.\nWhether it be a child who is suffering from AIDS in\nAfrica, an Afghan refugee facing starvation, or a\nhuman being discriminated against because of race, sex\nor religion \u2014 these are today our shared\nresponsibilities. Whether it be our threatened\nenvironment, the need for sustainable development, the\nneed for equal educational opportunities, access to the\nInternet, or the inclusion of the poor in the fruits of\ndevelopment \u2014 these are today our shared\nresponsibilities. Nuclear weapons proliferation,\nweapons of mass destruction and the protection of\nchildren in conflict situations \u2014 these also are today\nour shared responsibilities. No events could have made\nit clearer than did those we witnessed with horror on 11\nSeptember. We live in one world and no problem is\nonly our neighbour\u2019s problem, it is also our problem.\nThat underlines the need for a universal response\nto the challenges that the citizens of this global village\nface. It underlines the need for standards concerning\nprinciples and practices that guarantee justice \u2014 from\nthe Middle East to Cyprus, to Afghanistan and to\nKosovo. The need for these principles underlines the\npivotal role of the United Nations. I should like to\nexpress our warm support, respect and gratitude for the\ntireless efforts of Kofi Annan. Heartfelt congratulations\nto him and to the Organization he represents, the\nUnited Nations, on the award of this year\u2019s Nobel\nPeace Prize. It is a well-deserved accolade, an accolade\nthat carries with it a heightened sense of responsibility\nto provide global governance in this globalized\nworld \u2014 a world of global problems and global\nopportunities. Greece very much agrees with the words\nof Louis Michel, speaking in his capacity as President\nof the European Union, in support of the International\nCriminal Court and the continued reform of the United\nNations.\nToday in our search for justice on a global scale,\nour challenge is to seek moral clarity. We must be able\nto unite around what is right. The words \u201cfreedom\u201d,\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201chuman and minority rights\u201d, \u201cequality\u201d,\n\u201cpeaceful resolution of conflict\u201d, \u201csolidarity\u201d,\n\u201cinclusion\u201d, \u201copen society\u201d, \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d,\n\u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201cbiodiversity\u201d must all become the\ncore of our common values. Yet there are different\ninterpretations and different practices in our world\nconcerning these concepts. In our search for a common\nmoral code we must not allow a clash of cultures. We\nmust seek a dialogue of cultures, and from this\ndialogue of nations, cultures and religions, a common\nmoral code and order can and will emerge. The Charter\nof the United Nations embodies these values. Our\n5\n\nchallenge today is collectively to give practical\nmeaning to them. I should like to mention an important\nstep in recognizing and respecting the dignity and\ndiversity of our cultures in the world. Greece has tabled\na resolution on the return of cultural property.\nGreece has always stood at a crossroads of\ncultures. Our best moments have been when we used\nthat richness to learn. Today we are doing so again.\nGreece is a member of the European Union and of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, yet its roots in the\nEast enrich us in equal measure. We are proud to be\nEuropean and Balkan and Mediterranean. We once\nwere a nation of emigrants and our diaspora has linked\nus to all corners of the earth. Today we are a country\nthat welcomes immigrants. They make up more than 10\nper cent of our population.\nOurs is an open, multicultural society in the truest\nsense of the word. We see and we understand the world\nthrough many eyes. We understand that there are\ndifferent truths and different histories. Yet we approach\nour traditions not as a wall that isolates us from each\nother, but as depositories of knowledge and sources of\nunderstanding and communication between cultures.\nWe believe that our histories cannot enslave us, they\nmust become our way of learning for the future.\nThis commitment to dialogue is also a\ncommitment to reach specific, practical results that will\nenhance our region\u2019s ability and the world\ncommunity\u2019s capacity to establish well-respected\nvalues and principles in dealing with world problems\nsuch as terrorism. But in our fight against terrorism we\nmust uphold these principles, as they differentiate us\nfrom those who use violence as their means. We must\nalso heed what the Secretary-General in his address\nstressed. The problems we all shared prior to 11\nSeptember have not disappeared. However, I am\nencouraged to report that we have made significant\nstrides in our own region of South-Eastern Europe. We\ndid so by committing ourselves to serve these values:\nhuman and minority rights, democratic institutions,\ngood-neighbourly relations and the inviolability of\nborders. We remain committed to the principle that\nshould differences and disagreements emerge, we will\nseek to resolve them peacefully with respect to\ninternational law. We have managed to establish the\nframework of common values, one that will help us to\ncooperate to solve our problems. Emerging from a state\nof despair, the Balkans today represents a ray of hope\nfor all regions in conflict.\nOf course there is much to do. Let me list the\npriorities. We must turn provisional peace into\npermanent peace. We can do so by resolving\noutstanding bilateral issues. We must turn new-found\ndemocracies into permanent and active democracies.\nWe can do so by building civic capacity and strong\ntransparent institutions that will guarantee the rule of\nlaw. We must contain and eradicate organized crime, a\npoison that runs through new-found democracies and is\noften linked to terrorist networks. We must turn\nopportunistic capital investment into entrepreneurial\ninitiatives and permanent business propositions that\nprovide youth with the prospect of a better and more\nsecure future. We must turn segregated communities\ninto multicultural societies, and we can do so by\ninvesting in education. Greece has committed\nresources, and of course its political will, to the above.\nWe cannot stop now. As a world community we must\ncontinue and we must strengthen our investment in\npeople and in financial resources until our work is\ncomplete.\nTwo years ago I stood before you here with my\nTurkish colleague Ismail Cem, expressing the hope for\na new beginning in our relations, relations which\nhistory seems to have frozen into constant rivalry and\nconflict. Today I need not express only hope; I can\nreport that we have made significant progress. I have\njust come from a meeting with my Turkish counterpart\nwhere we signed a series of new agreements. Our\nmeetings have become frequent and regular. We work\ntogether. We learn together. We help each other out in\ntimes of difficulty and crisis. We have discovered the\nimportance of being good neighbours. We have started\nto develop a common architecture of trust. The\nproducts of our efforts are significant. We are\nconstantly adding confidence-building measures to\nassure peace in the Aegean.\nWe have made a commitment to jointly become\nparties to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, and we\nhave taken steps to cooperate against natural disasters.\nWe are cooperating in the fight against crime, drug\ntrafficking, illegal migration and terrorism. We are\ncooperating in tourism. Our trade has doubled. Energy\nand agriculture have emerged as new fields of further\ncooperation. Our two societies have taken the initiative\nto commence and develop common economic, cultural,\neducational and athletic activities.\n6\n\nThese achievements stand as a reminder of the\nresponse of our people after the earthquakes, when they\nsent us a message saying:\n\u201cWe have more in common than what separates\nus; we are all equally vulnerable to pain and\nsuffering; equally capable of sympathy and\ncompassion; equally responsible for the life we\noffer to the generations that are to follow.\u201d\nAgain this year Greece and Turkey will jointly submit\na draft resolution on emergency disaster relief. Our\nneighbour\u2019s path towards the European Union, a path\nwe wholeheartedly support, has set a new framework\nwithin which many of our remaining differences can be\nresolved. Step by step we are building a solid\nfoundation.\nOf course our work in the region is far from\ncomplete. The architecture of trust we are building in\nSouth-Eastern Europe is significantly hindered by the\nsituation in Cyprus, for the question of Cyprus remains\nunresolved. The island remains divided in a shameful\ncondition. Cyprus is a tragic example of where our\nshared sense of justice, our code of values, has gone\nastray. Yet here is a new opportunity. Both the Greek\nCypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities could\nbenefit from the island\u2019s membership in the European\nUnion. It is a win-win situation. I sincerely believe that\nevery Greek aspires to a solution on Cyprus that will\nsatisfy both communities, a solution imposed by no one\nparty and accepted by all. I believe that that is what\nevery citizen in neighbouring Turkey aspires to as well.\nOur constant reference to United Nations\nresolutions that clearly call for the creation of a\nbizonal, bicommunal federation cannot be interpreted\nas a desire for outside imposition \u2014 both communities\nhave suffered terribly from outside intervention. On the\ncontrary, this call expresses our deep belief in justice\nfor Cyprus, a sense of justice for both communities.\nThat is what the United Nations framework can\nguarantee.\nI therefore appeal to the Turkish leadership to use\nthat framework for a just solution. Let us not expand\nthe wall that divides the two communities in Cyprus to\ndivide Turkey from Europe. Let us instead break down\nthis last Berlin Wall in Europe and help to create a\ncommon future for the citizens of a free Cyprus. To all\nof us in the region, a region seeking to eliminate\ndivision, the prospect of the island\u2019s entrance into the\nunited European family should be a source of euphoria,\nnot fear.\nIf we do share a common moral order, a common\nunderstanding of what is right and wrong, then the\nMiddle East peace process had come close to\narticulating the principles we share. For the good of the\npeople in the region and its stability, that process must\ncontinue until a Palestinian State lives peacefully next\nto a secure Israel. That peace process must begin anew,\nwithout preconditions, based on secure initial steps\nthrough the implementation of the Mitchell report\nrecommendations. Greece, as both a member of the\nEuropean Union and a neighbour to the Middle East,\nwill commit its efforts in this crucial situation towards\nthe support of peace, rapprochement and reconciliation.\nWe also hope that the hardships of the people of\nIraq will cease and that the country will be fully\nintegrated into the world community under a leadership\nthat cooperates with the international community and\ncomplies with United Nations resolutions. That is also\nour stand with regard to Afghanistan. We look forward\nto the day that its Government represents its people and\nleads them closer to the world community. Here,\nGreece has already committed substantial resources\ntowards alleviating the humanitarian problem of the\nAfghanis.\nAt times when it is easy to succumb to fear we\nmust have the strength to build confidence within and\namong our societies. We must be able to celebrate\nhumanity in this global village, to go beyond our\ndifferences and conflicts. One such occasion is the\nOlympic Games. They are an ancient tradition that\ngrew out of the need for peace in the ancient world of\nHellenism. Today the five rings of the Olympic Games,\nwhich represent five continents, are the most\nrecognized symbol on this planet, surpassing any\ncommercial logo. Let us use this global celebration to\nfurther strengthen our community of common values.\nLet us again pledge our commitment to the Olympic\nTruce which the Secretary-General has so strongly\nsupported and the Millennium Summit has called for.\nIsmail Cem and I have only recently signed a\ndeclaration to this effect. Many ministers of the\nBalkans, Europe and the Mediterranean have followed.\nI invite all to become co-signatories.\nWe see that Truce as a moment in time powerful\nenough to change the world. During the ceasefire in\nBosnia the Olympic Truce helped the Red Cross to\n7\n\nvaccinate hundreds of children. The two Koreas\nparading under the same flag at the Sydney Games was\na powerful moment, witnessed by millions around the\nworld. We see truce as a time to reflect. We see truce as\na moment of silence. We see truce as a time to\nquestion, to examine what we believe. We see truce as\na time to heal our wounds. We can use this pause from\nviolence to celebrate and to rejoice, and we can use it\nto mourn and to remember. In Salt Lake City we can\nuse it to honour all those unjustly lost. If our global\nquest for peace is a journey of 1,000 miles, then truce\nis but the small first step. But imagine how glorious the\nrest of our journey can be if we celebrate humanity, if\nwe give peace a chance and commit ourselves to that\nfirst step.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to convey our sincere congratulations to\nMr. Kofi Annan on the occasion of his re-election to\nthe post of Secretary-General, as well as on winning\nthe Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. We also congratulate\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of the\nGeneral Assembly at the current session and we join\nthose who have already expressed gratitude to\nMr. Harri Holkeri for his excellent organization of the\nfifty-fifth session, which went down in the history of\ninternational relations as the Millennium Assembly.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\nplace in special circumstances. There is no doubt that\nthe tragic events of 11 September represent an\nobjective reality that has prompted the international\ncommunity to critically reassess the situation, which\nrequires the elaboration of common positions in the\ncombat against international terrorism, based on the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter on\nsafeguarding comprehensive peace and security.\nToday, it is evident that terrorism is related to\nextremism of every stripe \u2014 political, religious and\nethnic \u2014 as well as to separatism and drug trafficking.\nThese are the principle threats to the present and future\nof humankind, a plague of the twenty-first century that\ncan enter any household. No one carries insurance\nagainst this evil.\nThe international community is becoming\nincreasingly aware of the indivisibility of security. In\naccordance with this fundamental principle and in view\nof the current international situation, Uzbekistan\ncommits itself to go all the way in its fight against\nterrorism as a global phenomenon. Only through joint,\ncoordinated efforts of the entire international\ncommunity can we eradicate this evil. No one has the\nright to stand aloof from this battle.\nWe are acutely aware that, today, it is absolutely\nunacceptable to content ourselves with mere\ndeclarations and statements. It is time we supported our\nwords with action. Before it is too late, we must take\nthis opportunity to quit the cautious and defensive\nstance adopted in the struggle against international\nterrorism and to go on the offensive.\nSuch an approach is also dictated by a simple and\nobvious truth: it is impossible to come to an agreement\nwith terrorists. Not only modern experience in\ncombating terrorism but also the experience of history\nattest to this fact. The only way to deal with terrorists\nis to isolate them and stand up to them in the most\nuncompromising and resolute way.\nGiven the nature of international terrorism and its\nextensive organizational and financial network as well\nas its considerable material and technical resources, it\nis essential to devise a global counter-terrorist strategy\nthat will clearly define the following: first, the\nparameters of an effective legal framework as well as\nthe organizational foundations for international\ncooperation in this area; and secondly, forms of\nconcrete joint action at both the global and regional\nlevels as well as on a bilateral basis.\nRecent events have demonstrated clearly that\nterrorism is the most dangerous and treacherous enemy\n13\n\nof the international community. I think it may be\nrelevant to remind Members of the address that the\nPresident of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Mr. Karimov,\nmade to the General Assembly on 8 September 2000\nfrom this rostrum. He sounded the alarm, trying to\ndraw the attention of the international community to\nthe\n\u201c... war in Afghanistan, which has continued for\nmore than 20 years ... Afghanistan has become a\ntraining ground and hotbed of international\nterrorism and extremism, and the main source and\nthe warehouse of world drug production, which\nearns billions of dollars and fuels international\nterrorism.\u201d (A/55/PV.7, p. 15)\nHe also emphasized that this is \u201ca threat to the security\nnot only of the States of Central Asia, but of the whole\nworld\u201d. He unambiguously pointed to the particular\ndanger that the world would face if the terrorists were\nto gain access to deadly weapons such as chemical,\nbiological and other forms of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Here it is pertinent to ask: Was this not a\ntimely appeal?\nUzbekistan has been actively engaged in\ncooperation with the anti-terrorist coalition. We\nconsider the anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan as,\nfirst and foremost, a means to destroy the terrorist\nbases and camps in that country as well as to eradicate\nconditions favourable to terrorist activity.\nThe Uzbek people, being heirs to the great\nMuslim culture and having made a major contribution\nto the development and flourishing of Islamic\ncivilization, realize that this operation is not directed\nagainst either the people of Afghanistan or the religion\nof Islam. War has been declared against terrorists and\ntheir centres and training grounds, not against the\npeaceful population.\nUzbekistan and Afghanistan have a long history\nof neighbourly and mutually beneficial relations going\nback to antiquity. The Amu Darya River has always\nunited us, not separated us. Uzbekistan has never had a\nconflict either with the Afghan people or with\nAfghanistan as a State.\nThe civil war in Afghanistan, which has\ncontinued for three decades and reached its apogee\nduring the short period of Taliban rule, has destroyed\nthe country\u2019s economy and caused the Afghan people\ngreat distress, and it is a threat to the very existence of\nAfghanistan as an unified State. We support the efforts\nof the international community aimed at immediate\nmeasures to adopt large-scale programmes for the post-\nconflict rehabilitation of Afghanistan and concrete\nhumanitarian aid for those who urgently need such\nassistance in their plight.\nUzbekistan, in close collaboration with the\nUnited Nations, is already actively participating in the\ndelivery of international humanitarian aid to\nAfghanistan. For this purpose, we have provided all the\nnecessary infrastructure, including that in the city of\nTermez, in immediate proximity to the border of\nAfghanistan.\nFinally, in light of the latest events, including\nboth the acts of terror in the United States and the start\nof the anti-terrorist operation in Afghanistan, I would\nlike to draw the attention of participants in this session\nto the Uzbek proposal to establish within the United\nNations system an international centre to combat\nterrorism as a realistic mechanism for taking a\ncollective stand against terrorist aggression.\nIn discussing the organization of the international\nstruggle against terrorism, we should not forget yet\nanother equally dangerous threat \u2014 drug trafficking,\nthe main financial support for terrorist and extremist\nactivities. In recent years, the States of Central Asia\nhave found themselves practically face to face with\nlarge-scale aggression unleashed by the international\nnarcotics syndicates. It is perfectly clear that no single\ncountry, no matter how powerful its resources, can\nhope to confront drug trafficking successfully unless it\nenjoys the broad support of the international\ncommunity. In our view, international cooperation\nshould be based on mechanisms that are adapted as\nmuch as possible to the current situation and are\ncapable not only of neutralizing existing sources of\nnarco-aggression but also, and more important, of\npreventing them from emerging.\nRecognizing the urgent need to intensify the\ninternational struggle to face common threats,\nUzbekistan accords great significance to the issue of\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in\nCentral Asia. Given the unstable military and political\nsituation in the region, this problem is emerging as a\nreal threat of continental and global proportions.\nIn this respect, the functional capabilities of the\nCentral Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone \u2014 an\ninitiative put forward by Uzbekistan at the forty-eighth\n14\n\nsession of the General Assembly in the spirit of the\nNon-Proliferation Treaty \u2014 are of particular\nimportance. We much appreciate the efforts of the\nUnited Nations in supporting the activities of the\nRegional Group of Experts who are working on the text\nof the nuclear-weapon-free zone treaty, and we call\nupon the General Assembly, its President and the\nSecretary-General to lend their support to the process\nof formalizing and adopting decisions on this issue.\nUzbekistan supports the provisions in the report\nof the United Nations Secretary-General concerning the\nprevention of armed conflict. We consider them to be\nfundamental guidelines for consultations on this issue.\nWe also stand for the earliest completion of the\nUnited Nations reform process. We welcome certain\nareas of progress in the work of the Security Council\nwith regard to ensuring its transparency, the\nenlargement of its membership and other matters\nrelated to enhancing its effectiveness. With a view to\nincreasing the effectiveness of the United Nations and\nin the interests of preventing and settling crisis\nsituations, it is extremely important to intensify\ncollaboration between the United Nations and regional\nsecurity institutions, as well as to enhance the work of\nits own regional offices.\nUzbekistan has an interest in developing and\nenhancing dialogue and cooperation with all States that\ndisplay an interest in strengthening peace and stability\nat the regional and global levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffJust\nover a year ago, we were here, attending the\nMillennium Summit, some 100 days before the dawn of\nthe twenty-first century. At that time, I made a\nstatement on behalf of Venezuela and its Bolivarian\npeople, referring to the supreme example of Christ and\nhis struggle for justice, peace and life.\nIn the brief span of time since then, having\nembarked on the new century \u2014 albeit with very\npainful steps, I should say \u2014 we have suffered the\nabominable terrorist attack of 11 September. In\nopposition to the culture of peace, to the dialogue\namong civilizations declared by the United Nations in\n2001 and to the good will of the peoples of the world,\nthe drums of war are suddenly thundering again and we\nsay, louder and more passionately than we have in the\npast, that this struggle for peace is of fundamental\nimportance.\nFrom the outset, Venezuela and its people,\nGovernment and institutions have joined in the chorus\nof voices that first rose to reject these heinous acts. At\nthis meeting in New York, in this incredible city, in this\nnation of North America, we take this opportunity to\nreiterate our grief and sympathy for the people and\nGovernment of the United States and its institutions\nover the attacks and the pain they have caused. We say,\nas we have said from the very day of the tragedy that\nhas plunged the world into mourning and peril, that the\nfight against terrorism should become a war against\nwar \u2014 a fight to achieve peace.\nAt the Millennium Summit, we also said, like\nSim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the liberator of South America,\nremembering his dream of the summit of Chimborazo:\nLet us speak the truth to all men and women. And\nprecisely on the basis of the horrible and frightful\ntruths that we are experiencing today in the world, let\nus call for a new world pact in the United Nations. We\nsaid in that speech just over one year ago that at the\npresent time in our world human beings continue to die\neach day, but now the figures have doubled, and not\nbecause of a world war. No, now the principal causes\nof the horrible truth affecting the world\u2019s people are\npoverty, marginalization and hunger. What is foremost\nin this dramatic and tragic moment is that we must\nrecognize the truth and then build a new global pact in\nthe United Nations without delay.\nNow, at the beginning of the twenty-first century\nand the third millennium, we at the United Nations\nshould concentrate our greatest possible efforts on the\nmoral, intellectual, scientific, social, cultural, economic\nand financial order in the fight against the demons of\nhunger, poverty and death that afflict the planet. This is\nwhat we said a year ago in this beautiful setting. I\nbelieve we are fulfilling the mandate of Bol\u00edvar to state\nthe truth to all men and women.\nVenezuela recognized the validity, the necessity,\nthe great vision and the truth that our Secretary-\nGeneral launched as a challenge to all of us in the\npreparatory document that subsequently became the\nMillennium Declaration. Today, our dear friend Kofi\nAnnan reminded us of that challenge in his comments\nopening this session of debates, when he recalled, for\nexample, that last year we committed ourselves to\nreducing poverty 50 per cent by the year 2015, having\nset quantifiable and precise goals, such as reducing by\nhalf the number of human beings who survive on\nincomes of less than one dollar per day.\nAt the Millennium Summit, great truths were\nstated and we heard the appeals of our peoples. We said\nthen and continue to say that all of the world\u2019s children\nmust have access to a full education by the year 2015.\nAs the Secretary-General also reminded us, all human\nbeings should have access to potable water. We are not\ntalking about the Internet \u2014 we are talking about\ndrinking water, the water basic to life.\nThe goals set last year were discussed over the\nfollowing weeks in hundreds of marvellous speeches.\nBut today, one year later, we must continue to ask\nourselves how we are going to achieve them. What are\nthe successful strategies that can be employed to\nachieve these lofty goals? The answer is justice, the\nonly path to true peace. We said that we had come to\nuncover truths; that for the honour, dignity and life of\nour peoples, we must come here to speak without fear.\nWe said that here, in this setting, we must speak\nwithout the double standard that sometimes invades our\ndiscussions. As I see our brothers from India here, I\nthink of the Hindu philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti,\nwho spoke of truth as a basic dynamic in understanding\nthe secrets of life. Truth, truth, truth. We want truths. If\nwe do not recognize truths, it will be difficult for us to\n24\n\nfind true solutions to the horrible tragedies that the\nworld is living through.\nOn behalf of the people of Venezuela, I return\nhere today to contribute ideas to the effort to seek\ntruths and to speak true words that spring from a\ncombination of reason and passion. They are not just\ncold words on paper but come from the heart, and they\nmust not remain on paper as cold discourse but must\ntouch the wound of real truth. Today, truth is an open\nwound and it is our ultimate challenge to heal it. We\ncome, then, without fear, in good faith and with much\noptimism about life, brotherhood, unity and the\npossibility that we, as the leaders of our countries, can\nseek, grasp and build together real solutions to real\nproblems in the quest for justice and peace.\nWe in Venezuela believe that the world must be\nexamined under a great and powerful magnifying glass,\nbecause it has gone to bad to worse, stumbling and\nstruggling from error to error. At the end of the Second\nWorld War, the United Nations was born to struggle for\npeace and prevent new horrors from happening. We\nhave not avoided those horrors. The Berlin Wall and\nthe Soviet Union fell at the end of the twentieth\ncentury, and voices were raised saying history has\ncome to an end: we have arrived at the end of our path,\nthe final era, one of technology, of the global village,\nof globalization, of the new world order. This is the\ntriumph of a model \u2014 the triumph of one philosophy\nas the result of the collapse of another. But that claim\nwas a lie. Who can claim victory in today\u2019s world,\nwhich is filled with poverty and tears, pain and death?\nWhat model could claim victory?\nVenezuela would like to make a fervent and\npassionate appeal, hopeful that we will be properly\nunderstood \u2014 indeed, we are sure that we will be,\nbecause we are speaking with love, faith and hope,\ncalling on the Lord God, invoking life and peace and\nrespect for brotherhood. Let our words be properly\nunderstood. We must undertake a thorough\nexamination of and review the political models that\nexist in our countries today. In America we speak of\ndemocracy \u2014 yes, democracy. But in Venezuela we ask\nwhat kind of democracy we are talking about. A\ndemocracy such as Venezuela had for 40 years, from\n1958 to 1998, which ended up destroying a people,\ntaking away their sovereignty and causing them to live\nin poverty in a fertile land rich with resources such as\noil and gold? That was no more than an ornamental\nflourish that mimicked democracy, and it ended in\ntyranny. We never again want such a democracy in\nVenezuela, and we are certain that we will never have\nit again. Democracy must be based on popular\nparticipation, ethics, justice and equality.\nWe in Venezuela have been saying that we must\nalso review the economic models that some tried to put\nin place among our peoples. Is neoliberalism the way?\nYes \u2014 it is the way to hell. Let us traverse the streets\nand cities of Latin America and we will see the\nconsequences of neoliberal policies run wild, as His\nHoliness John Paul II has said. We must review our\neconomies, our ethics, our policies \u2014 everything must\nbe re-examined today if we want the world to be a\nviable place and if we want peace to reign on earth.\nIs globalization the path to development? It could\nbe, if it were based on justice, equality and respectful\nrelations among all. We need to re-examine everything.\nAs Viviane Forrester said, using the phrase \u201ceconomic\nhorror\u201d, the world is undergoing a process of change,\nand that should also be cause for optimism. The world\nis changing; it is moving on. New developments are\ntaking place; let us move with them, peacefully and\ndemocratically, while searching for justice. As Ignacio\nRamonet said in his reflections in Le Monde\nDiplomatique, alternative paths are appearing all over\nthe world. Venezuela is making its humble contribution\nthrough a peaceful and democratic revolution. We are\ncommitted to the human being, to an international\npolicy of peace, friendship, respect and multipolarity.\nAnd we are here today to reaffirm that commitment.\nVenezuela is speaking out in condemning\nterrorism. Venezuela is speaking out \u2014 and taking\naction \u2014 in expressing its solidarity in the struggle\nagainst terrorism. At the same time, in speaking out we\nare giving voice to the mandate of the United Nations\nto ensure respect for international law and human\nrights. Any action taken against any crime must be\nlegitimate. It must be based on respect for human rights\nand international law. No one should understand\nVenezuela\u2019s words to be a condemnation of anything or\nanyone. We are calling for reflection so as to ensure\nthat we act within the norms of international law and\nthe mandates of the United Nations. We cannot throw\nthat overboard.\nVenezuela has also shouldered its responsibility\nin various forums and international arenas. Within the\nOrganization of American States, we are proposing that\na social charter be adopted, in addition to the\n25\n\nDemocratic Charter, to give more weight to our\ncontinent\u2019s struggles to place the human being at the\nforefront of our endeavours. Within the Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries, of which we hold the\npresidency of the conference of heads of State, we\nproposed \u2014 and achieved consensus among all \u2014 to\nensure balance and dialogue between the producers and\nconsumers of oil, aware as we are of the need to\nguarantee supplies and a fair price for all for that vital\nresource for development and for life.\nWithin the Group of Fifteen, Venezuela, which\nholds the chairmanship, is promoting the North-South\ndialogue, in particular the need to revitalize it. It\nshould not be a dialogue of the deaf, but a dialogue of\nequals who are seeking solutions \u2014 dialogue and\ncooperation of South with South and of Latin American\nand the Caribbean with Africa, Asia and all the peoples\nof the world. Within the Group of 77, Venezuela is\nworking for the same strategic consensus, dialogue and\nunity. We are very optimistic, as everyone should be.\nDespite everything, however, we need great\npolitical will \u2014 greater political will \u2014 to bring about\nall of those changes and transformations. To use the\nvocabulary of the theory of war, we must put the\ncavalry on the front line. The cavalry is policy; the\ncavalry is ethics and the will for change, which we\nmust promote.\nFinally, I believe that, over and above the pain,\nthe condemnation and the struggle against terrorism\nand against the savages who perpetrated those horrific\nattacks, the greatest honour must go to the fallen \u2014 the\ninnocent victims of those acts, and the many other\nvictims throughout the world, those who have suffered\nand for whom we have wept: the innocent children who\nhave fallen, the men and the women. The British Prime\nMinister, Tony Blair, said something that I thought was\nwonderful in response to a comment that I made during\na conversation we had in Downing Street a few days\nago. He said that if anything good can come from this\ncrisis and this pain, it is a global alliance to combat the\ncauses of violence throughout the world.\nThose who have spoken before me have pointed\nout many of these causes. The Emir of Qatar and\nChairman of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference also made a very important point. He said\nthat our words should not once again remain empty. As\nwe say in our part of the world, there is a big difference\nbetween words and action. Now is the time to move\ntowards concrete action. We want to see a Palestinian\nState become a reality. Let us not come here day after\nday, month after month and year after year just to\nrepeat the same old words. Let us move on towards\nreality. We want to see the transformation of the\nBretton Woods institutions. We want to see the\ntransformation of the International Monetary Fund and\nthe World Bank. We want justice for the wretched of\nthe Earth, as Frantz Fanon said. But we want it now,\nnot tomorrow; tomorrow may be too late.\nIn conclusion, as I said during the debate on 7\nSeptember last year, quoting from the Bible,\n\u201cTo everything there is a season, and a time\nto every purpose under the heaven\u201d. (The Holy\nBible, Ecclesiastes 3:1)\nSisters and brothers of this planet in sorrow, of this our\nworld, let us do all that we can. Truly, we must\ntransform this difficult time in which we are living into\na time of the people, a time of justice; that is the only\nway to achieve genuine peace. As I ended by saying\nlast year, let us save the world!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first join\nprevious speakers in expressing our heartfelt\nsympathies to the host country and to the bereaved\nfamilies for the loss of their loved ones in yesterday\u2019s\ndisaster.\nEver since 11 September, the fight against\nterrorism in all its forms has rightfully been at the top\nof the agenda of the United Nations and of other\ninternational organizations. On behalf of the\nGovernment of Liechtenstein, I wish to pledge our full\nsupport for international cooperation to combat\nterrorism. A quick understanding has emerged that\nmultilateralism and international cooperation are the\nonly ways to successfully tackle the challenges we are\nfacing. Once again, the world has looked to the United\nNations for leadership in our common fight, and once\nagain the United Nations has delivered. We wish to pay\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He has\nnavigated this Organization in a most clever, capable\nand visionary manner through turbulent times and\nassiduously enhanced its standing in the international\narena. Right before the beginning of his second term as\nSecretary-General the United Nations is a stronger and\nmore credible organization than ever. I wish to\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, and indeed the\nentire Organization he heads, on being awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize. No one could be better placed to be\na voice of international legitimacy and to provide\nleadership during the times ahead \u2014 and this is a\nmoment when leadership is most needed.\n20\n\nBoth the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil have reacted with resolve and determination to\nthe attacks of 11 September. The Council took a bold\nstep in adopting its ground-breaking resolution 1373\n(2001). We are indeed facing a new type of crisis and\nthe Security Council has designed a new type of\nresponse. The delegation of Liechtenstein looks\nforward to working closely with the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee to fully implement the provisions of that\nresolution. Given the novelty of the task, we appreciate\nthe difficulties and enormous workload the Committee\nis facing. We also express our support for the\ntransparent manner and the spirit of cooperation and\ndialogue which the Committee has displayed thus far in\ncarrying out its work. Benchmarking and best practices\nare of the utmost importance in this context. High\nstandards of enforcement have to be developed and to\nbe applied uniformly to all actors, be they\nGovernments, banks, intermediaries, fiduciaries or\nattorneys. We are committed to implementing\nresolution 1373 (2001) as a whole, but will place\nparticular emphasis on its central aspects relating to the\nfinancing of terrorism. We have all the necessary\ninstruments in place to make our contribution to\nsuppress and prevent the financing of terrorism.\nConsequently, I signed on behalf of Liechtenstein the\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism on 2 October this year. Our common effort\ncan only be successful if it is focused on our true goal\nof stopping financial flows to terrorists and their\norganizations. We must not, however, venture into\nother areas of international financing under the guise of\nfighting terrorism. In this context I wish to state very\nclearly that bank secrecy as practised in Liechtenstein\nnever has provided and never will provide protection to\nterrorists or their financial transactions.\nIf the fight against terrorism is to be a genuinely\ncommon effort, it must include all of us. The General\nAssembly, as the only all-inclusive organ of the United\nNations, must therefore play a significant role in our\nefforts. We trust that the General Assembly will assert\nits rightful place as the law-making body of the United\nNations by adopting a comprehensive convention\nagainst terrorism to fill the gaps in the existing\nframework of international law dealing with specific\naspects of terrorism.\nThe fight against terrorism is multifaceted and the\nrole of the United Nations must also cover a wide\nrange of topics, including what is often referred to as\nthe root causes of terrorism. Indeed, isolating the\nextremists, exposing the perversity of their agenda, and\nthus preventing more misguided and disenfranchised\npeople from joining a cause of insanity, is the only way\nour fight will be successful in the long term. Poverty,\nsocial exclusion and marginalization, and the lack of\nbasic education are key areas we must address. These\nare, of course, by no means new topics on the agenda\nof the United Nations, but we need to do more and we\nneed to do better. Informed and educated policy\nchanges are not concessions to the evil of terrorism.\nSuch thinking would lead to paralysis and inaction. It\nis of crucial importance that the spirit of international\ncooperation, rather than being selective and short-lived,\nshould prevail in our work on these essential issues.\nThe United Nations is further challenged on the\ncomplex relationship between terrorism and human\nrights. The promotion and protection of human rights\nmust not fall victim to the fight against terrorism.\nHuman rights are not a luxury that we can afford\nduring good times and dispense with in times of crisis.\nRather, they are the foundation upon which all our\nactivities must be based. Curtailing the existing human\nrights standards in the name of the fight against\nterrorism would mean giving up our most fundamental\nvalues \u2014 the very values that those who commit\nterrorist attacks are out to destroy. This we must not\nallow to happen. The World Conference against\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\nRelated Intolerance was concluded on 8 September. I\nhad the honour to attend that event in my capacity as\nChairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council\nof Europe, which served as the regional preparatory\nbody for the Conference. After a most difficult and\ncomplex process, the Conference was brought to a\nsuccessful end with probably the best achievable\noutcome \u2014 the resolution of issues of both the past and\nthe present, and a global anti-discrimination agenda\nwithin which we all can work.\nThe difficulties of the Durban Conference are\nreflected in the still ongoing debate on remaining\ntechnical, but important, details. The necessary\npolitical will should be mustered as soon as possible so\nthat the message from Durban can reach people\nworldwide. The events of 11 September have given\nadditional significance to this message, since racism\nand intolerance can be both cause and consequence of\nterrorism. One of our most difficult new challenges in\nour fight against racism is to prevent discrimination\n21\n\nagainst people because of their affiliation with certain\nethnic groups.\nThere are those who interpret the events of 11\nSeptember as a fulfilment of a predicted clash of\ncivilizations. They are wrong. Those who committed\nthe attacks do not represent a civilization or religion;\nthey believe only in terror, violence and destruction.\nThey are just criminals. Their acts were not an attack\non a civilization; they were an attack on, and a crime\nagainst, humanity. But, of course, nothing would serve\ntheir intentions better than a clash of civilizations. The\nUnited Nations is therefore challenged to prevent such\na clash. The International Year of Dialogue among\nCivilizations serves as a useful reminder of what the\nUnited Nations has always stood for.\nTerrorism cannot be fought only with military\nmeasures and international judicial cooperation. Only\nby going beyond these obvious measures can we be\nsuccessful in the long term. We must change the\ncollective conscience and awareness of all societies\nand teach our children the futility and the dangers of\nresorting to violence as a means of dealing with\nconflicts. Terrorists utilize the most extreme forms of\nviolence. Therefore, they must be effectively excluded\nfrom society. They must be outlawed. It must be\nunacceptable for terrorists to establish themselves as\npolitical players by resorting to violence and by\nindiscriminately attacking civilians.\nThis unified stance against terrorism must, in\nturn, be accompanied by our willingness to engage in a\npeaceful dialogue with those who advocate legitimate\npolitical causes, difficult as that may seem. Only by\nensuring that communities and entities are not\noppressed, and that they are given room to voice their\nconcerns, can we eventually eradicate terrorism. In this\ncontext it is important that the international community\ndevelop mechanisms that allow for such a dialogue to\ntake place, based on an agreed framework and existing\nstandards of international law. We must not accept\nterrorism as a fact of life, but believe in our collective\nability to eradicate it. That goal may seem distant or\neven unrealistic, but so did the goal of eradicating\nslavery in the nineteenth century and fascism in the\ntwentieth century. It is now up to all of us to free\nourselves from terrorism, the scourge of the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n"

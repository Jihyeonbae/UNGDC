# Modeling Results with LIWC

## Data
For this analysis, I used `data/interim/liwc_controls.csv` file. This is a merged dataset of two separate files, `LIWC-22 Results - cleaned - LIWC Analysis.csv` and `data/interim/controls.csv`. 

- The first file, LIWC Analysis.csv is a result output generated by LIWC GUI. 
Each speech (identified by the country code and year) has its unique scores across 80 LIWC dictionaries. 
- I also used a battery of relevant covariates at a country-year level. These two files were merged with unique identifiers ccode_iso and year. 

See [`liwc_modeling.R`](https://github.com/Jihyeonbae/UNGDC/blob/main/notebooks/exploratory/liwc_modeling.R) for the full R script. 

## Hypotheses

1. Authoritarian states invoke the term sovereignty as a justification to controversial agendas. Observable implication of this is that authoritarian states will show high score of insecurity when invoking the sovereignty principle. 

	H1: Among the speeches that mention the word "sovereignty," the higher the "v2x_polyarchy" score is for the speaker country, the higher its insecurity sentiment scores are. A list of insecurity sentiments that are operationzalized in LIWC are emo_neg, emo_anx, emo_anger, emo_sad, conflict, lack, fulfill, fatigue, risk, power.
